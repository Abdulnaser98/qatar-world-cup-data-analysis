#### Abstract
>Relying on the background of document retrieval systems, this paper presents an argument retrieval system. It uses state of the art python libraries to automatically process a data set of arguments from the args.me corpus and store them in a custom index. The system can perform the process of ranking and ordering a list of relevant documents in response to a user's query by comparing the request to the produced index of documents. The special focus is on the use of several NLP-based analyses, including topic signal modeling, stylometric analysis, and primarily bias detection. These methods will be used to influence the ranking of the search engine.
