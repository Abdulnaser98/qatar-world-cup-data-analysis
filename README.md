## Using Natural Language Processing Approaches to compare different media outlets on covering the world cup 2022


___
#### Research question:
> **The FIFA football world cup 2022** was unlike other world cups before. Starting with corruption scandals surrounding the awarding, to the high death toll of construction workers and ongoing human rights abuses, the focus of the media did not seem to be purely on the beautiful game, at least in western countries. But how was the first world cup hosted by an arab/african nation perceived around the world? How did different media outlets report on it? What topics were discussed and what was the sentiment and did the different media outlets discuss different topics or did they discuss similar topics? To answer these questions, we must collect news reports from all over the world, dating way before the first whistle blew in November 2022. 


**Data Schema**:
