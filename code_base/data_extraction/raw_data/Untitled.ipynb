       "      <td>As Liverpool fans stream into Qatar to watch the Fifa Club World Cup next week, it will be easy to forget the thousands of workers from the poorest countries in the region who have toiled for years to construct its glittering buildings.\\r\\nWhen they take their seats at the Khalifa International Stadium, where Liverpool will play their semi-final match, they may not realise that scores of workers who refurbished the stadium were housed in filthy, overcrowded accommodation with an ever-present stench of raw sewage.\\r\\nThere will be no announcements to inform them that these men were paid less than promised, their passports were confiscated and they were unable to change jobs or quit the country, leaving some vulnerable to forced labour, a modern form of slavery, according to Amnesty International.\\r\\nAnd looking up at the soaring stadium arches, there will be nothing to remind them that British construction worker Zac Cox fell to his death here in 2017.\\r\\nFifa announced on Saturday that the original venue for the game on 18 December, the dazzling new Education City Stadium, was not match ready.\\r\\nBut the Education City stadium also has a story of death and indifference at the highest levels of the game.\\r\\nIn June, a 24-year-old labourer from Nepal, Rupchandra Rumba, died gasping for breath in a squalid labour camp on the outskirts of Doha. He was working as a scaffolder at Education City Stadium.\\r\\nNearly six months after he died, and more than two months since the Guardian first revealed her plight, RumbaÂs wife, Nirmala Pakrin, has still not received any compensation from Qatar.\\r\\nSitting in her small room on the edge of Kathmandu, with photos of her husband on the walls, Pakrin says their six-year-old son, Niraj, is struggling to accept that his father is not coming home. ÂHe keeps asking: ÂWhereÂs my dad? Why is he not calling? When will he come?ÂÂ she says.\\r\\nIn recent weeks, Pakrin says the director of the company that employed Rumba has been pressuring her to accept a pay-off of 7,000 Qatari rials (Â£1,460).\\r\\nShe says she feels afraid. ÂIÂm concerned about my safety. He is using threatening language,Â she says.\\r\\nHer brother, Pradip Pakrin, has dismissed the offer, saying: ÂWe have to fight for what is right. If we accept this, other families will suffer.Â\\r\\nNick McGeehan, a director of Fair/Square Projects and an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf, says: ÂWe appear to have this appalling situation where the families of workers who have died get derisory pay-offs or nothing at all from Qatar.Â McGeehan says the supreme committee, the body organising the Club World Cup, which starts on Wednesday, must take responsibility for the unexplained deaths of young men building its stadiums and compensate their families.\\r\\nLiverpoolÂs CEO, Peter Moore, backed McGeehan in a letter on Tuesday, saying: ÂWe support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve.Â\\r\\nRumbaÂs case is not a one-off. A total of 11 stadium workers died in 2018, according to the supreme committee. Of these deaths, 10 were described as Ânon-work relatedÂ, mostly attributed to sudden and unexplained heart or respiratory failure.\\r\\nData on the number of deaths of stadium workers in 2019 has not yet been published.\\r\\nIn the past year the Guardian has spoken to the families of five deceased stadium workers, including Rumba. Two say they have not received any compensation from Qatar. The other three only received compensation after the Guardian revealed their stories last year.\\r\\nÂPoor people like us cannot hope to get compensation,Â says Johurul Islam, whose brother-in-law, Monjurul Islam, 28, a stadium worker from Bangladesh, died in August 2018. ÂThe Qatar government does not see us as human.Â\\r\\nA spokesperson for the supreme committee said in a statement that in most cases compensation is only paid when a worker dies in a work-related accident. For non-work-related deaths, Âthe supreme committee ensures our contractors pay final salaries [and] end of service benefits.Â\\r\\nThe GuardianÂs findings will heap pressure on Liverpool, whose participation in the tournament has come under scrutiny from fans and human rights groups.\\r\\nMinky Worden, a director at Human Rights Watch, believes LiverpoolÂs players and management should raise these abuses and demand reforms. ÂLiverpool and other teams who play in Qatar should be aware that migrant workers have died to deliver the stadiums they are playing in, and at every opportunity speak up to insist that they are protected,Â she says.\\r\\nLast month, in an interview for the clubÂs television channel, Moore said the club had Âgone to great lengthsÂ to understand the issues in Qatar. ÂWeÂre not a political organisation and itÂs neither our place nor our ambition to go from country to country forcing our values and our beliefs on others,Â he added.\\r\\nThat may come as bad news to the family of Monjurul Islam. Johurul Islam says his brother-in-law paid a recruitment agent almost 500,000 Bangladeshi taka (Â£4,470) to secure his job in Qatar, a fee he could only afford by selling his land and taking out loans.\\r\\nThe agent promised him a lucrative salary, but his basic wage turned out to be just 600 Qatari rials a month (Â£125), says Johurul, far below the minimum wage, which itself is widely viewed as inadequate.\\r\\nJohurul claims MonjurulÂs direct employer, one of QatarÂs largest construction companies, did not provide any compensation. ÂThey didnÂt even pay all the salary and allowances they owed him.Â\\r\\nJohurul has been left devastated and confused by his death. ÂI was very close to him. He had no illness. His death certificate said he died of a heart attack, but I still donÂt believe it,Â he says.\\r\\nHe has good reason to be suspicious. In October the Guardian revealed that in the vast majority of cases the Qatari authorities do not carry out postmortem examinations, making it impossible to accurately determine the cause of death.\\r\\nDeath certificates routinely state that workers die of respiratory or cardiac failure Âdue to natural causesÂ, but such explanations are meaningless, according to a British forensic pathologist, Stuart Hamilton.\\r\\nÂAll they say is someone died because they are dead. If a trainee pathologist presented me with these conclusions, I would tell them to go away and do some more work,Â says Hamilton.\\r\\nThe Guardian has found that many deaths of migrant workers in Qatar are likely to be linked to the extreme summer heat, which sees workers toiling in temperatures that regularly reach 45C.\\r\\nThe number of World Cup 2022 stadium workers who die each year are just a fraction of the total number of migrant worker deaths. Less than 2% of QatarÂs migrant workforce are employed at World Cup stadiums, but tens of thousands are working on infrastructure to support the World Cup in 2022, including hotel, rail and road construction.\\r\\nGovernment data from India, Nepal and Bangladesh reveal the true scale of the death toll in Qatar. At least 1,025 workers from Nepal died between 2012 and 2017, 676 of them from causes deemed to be ÂnaturalÂ. In 2018, 149 Bangladeshi workers died, with 107 deaths classified as ÂnaturalÂ. Between 2012 and August 2018, 1,678 Indian workers died. Of these deaths, 1,345 were described as ÂnaturalÂ Â a rate of four a week.\\r\\nA spokesperson for the supreme committee said the health and safety of all its workers was of the Âutmost importanceÂ. The supreme committee Âinvestigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities Â",
       " to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident Â",
       " the responsibility to investigate the underlying causes of non-work related death lies with the relevant local authorities.Â\\r\\nIn a statement, a Fifa spokesperson said Fifa, along with its local partners, is Âfully committed to safeguarding the rights of workersÂ contributing to the Club World Cup and the 2022 World Cup. The spokesperson added that Âsignificant measures have been put in place at World Cup construction sites focusing on health and safety and workersÂ protectionÂ.\\r\\nAdditional reporting by Roshan Sedhai in Kathmandu, and Md Owasim Uddin Bhuyan and Salman Saeed in Dhaka\\r\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Job done in Canberra, as nearly 20,000 fans go home happy as Australia secure a comfortable win against Asian minnows, Nepal.\\r\\n76% possession and 36 shots at goal for the Socceroos - you canÂt window dress it, it was a mismatch. Australia looked especially lively early on (and Nepal conversely, very nervous) with early goals suggesting the game could turn into a rout. Whether Australia eased off, or Nepal became more confident, as a spectacle the game quickly ebbed away in the second half.\\r\\nFor coach Graham Arnold it was an opportunity to blood some new faces - a debut handed to former Olyroos protege Harry Souttar - while fringe players also got some decent minutes. With Chinese Taipei to come in five days time, the ÂRoos boss spoke about the importance of building depth at the international level.\\r\\nThe depth is definitely growing, the concern may well be however quality. That will be for another day, however, when the Socceroos face a much more difficult opponent.\\r\\nA credit to Nepal for sticking to the task, but it was a fairly straightforward affair. Two played, two won - the long march to Qatar in 2022 continues to build nicely.\\r\\nAnd if you missed any of the action - hereÂs the full-time write up:\\r\\nThe positives:\\r\\nA hat-trick for Jamie Maclaren - great for the striker, whoÂs translated his domestic FFA Cup form onto the international stage.\\r\\nA goal on debut for Harry Souttar, who troubled Nepal no-end with his height and strength from the set piece.\\r\\nA clean sheet, no injuries, some good minutes for fringe and younger Socceroos.\\r\\nThe negatives:\\r\\nAt times it looked limited in the build up - dangerous from the set piece, Australia created very few chances of real merit from open play.\\r\\nAs Nepal became more compact, Australia reverted more to the flanks. Crosses are by definition a low-percentage play - against more well-organised defences the speed of ball will need to be much quicker and greater rotations and variety will be needed, especially through the middle.\\r\\nA fun stat from AustraliaÂs pre-eminent football statistician, the one-and-only Andrew Howe:\\r\\nalmost missed this: Aziz Behich with his 21st consecutive @Socceroos start in #AUSvNEP - this is most consecutive starts for any player since Alex Tobin 1999 (who ultimately made 22 straight starts in that streak)\\r\\nItÂs a remarkable run - especially given the troubles Australia has had a left back over the past few years (or possibly ever since Scott Chipperfield hung up his boots).\\r\\nAlex Gersbach has struggled for consistent game time over the years in Europe, while Jason Davidson appears to have fallen down the pecking order.\\r\\nIt wasnÂt a five-star display from Behich, but it will do his confidence no harm to keep getting the starting nod.\\r\\nAnd with that result, Australia return to the top of Group B - two played, two won, eight scored, none conceded.\\r\\nThere is of course a key group fixture taking place later today as Jordan play host to Kuwait. TheyÂre the two stronger rivals in the pool, with Jordan the only other undefeated team at this early stage.\\r\\nThere is of course a very preliminary feel to the Asian Football Confederation Second Round pool competition - donÂt forget, thereÂs a whole another round of round robin clashes to come in the Third Round - you do however have to earn the right to participate in that, even if the quality of opposition can at times be a little less than desired.\\r\\nSo - your thoughts on that performance, Socceroos fans? The result was of course pretty clear cut, but did Australia show enough against for when theyÂll face tougher opponents?\\r\\nOutside of an unfortunate own-goal there was very little goal threat in the second half until that 89th move involving Milligan, Irvine and Maclaren. Will that concern Graham Arnold?\\r\\n90 + 1 min: Three minutes added on is the word from the touchline, and Australia push for one last goal, while Nepal for their part drop deeper yet.\\r\\nAnd thereÂs the final whistle. Points secured, no injuries and a clean sheet. The Socceroos take one more step closer to Qatar - job done.\\r\\n89 min: And thereÂs his hat-trick! ItÂs a clever flicked pass from Irvine off the chest, and Maclaren controls well to rifle home from close distance once again. Milligan the skipper fired the first ball in - a well-executed move from the Socceroos.\\r\\n88 min: ItÂs another freekick, and this time itÂs Mabil who strikes it - but it flies just over the crossbar! HeÂs annoyed with himself, but in truth it wasnÂt a bad effort.\\r\\n86 min: A final change, and itÂs the hard-working Bishal Rai that makes way, Santosh Tamang comes on.\\r\\nA set piece to Australia, and itÂs Hrustic whose standing over it. Has he got a Ronaldo-esque freekick in his locker?\\r\\nHe hits it well, but it just clips the top of the wall. Danger averted.\\r\\n85 min: All a little too static from the Socceroos, Nepal have looked increasingly comfortable this second half, channelling backwards to get plenty of bodies in the way centrally.\\r\\n83 min: Mabil looks to fashion something, before it breaks for Giannou - but his driven effort is blocked. It almost leads to a good transition opportunity for Nepal, but Irvine nips in well to cut out the danger.\\r\\n81 min: A fine ball into the box from Mabil, heÂs looked lively since coming on.\\r\\nItÂs patient from the Socceroos in build up once again, but the attempted cross-field ball is cut out.\\r\\n78 min: A chance for Nepal to counter quickly, but the first-time ball wide is slightly overhit and it flies into touch.\\r\\nA second sub for the visitors, and it appears the striker Anjan Bista is making way for the defender Devendra Tamang. Not sure if thereÂs a tactical adjustment, or whether personnel will shift positions to maintain the same structure.\\r\\n75 min: Australia ready their third and final change, it looks like Awer Mabil is getting ready, presumably for Leckie?\\r\\nHeÂs drifting deep, the Hertha Berlin man, looking to work some one-twos. And it is Leckie that makes way.\\r\\n73 min: If youÂre the Socceroos coaching staff, would you be happy with the way playÂs been building up?\\r\\nTheyÂre reverting to a lot of crosses - obviously the aerial threat is an area of advantage - but has this come at the expense of attacks from more dangerous areas?\\r\\n70 min: Some patient possession at the back for the Socceroos, Nepal are now starting to drop a little deeper.\\r\\nA nasty head clash, as Bailey Wright goes down. HeÂs back on his feet, but doesnÂt take kindly to Gharti MagarÂs marginally late challenge.\\r\\n68 min: 18,563 the official attendance in Canberra tonight. Not bad for a frosty eve in the nationÂs capital.\\r\\nAnd we could be about to see a second cap for another rising youngster, Ajdin Hrustic, who comes on to replace Goodwin.\\r\\n66 min: And itÂs the Nepalese wonderkid - a surprise starter from the bench - Bimal Gharti Magar - who comes on. LetÂs see what threat he can pose the Socceroos backline.\\r\\n63 min: A reminder, Australia will be in action again in five days time against Chinese Taipei, some Graham Arnold takes the opportunity to shuffle his pack.\\r\\nHeÂs not looking entirely pleased on the sideline, the Socceroos coach. TheyÂve not looked as dominant since the break, it must be said.\\r\\n61 min: Ooph. Jackson Irvine just canÂt buy a goal tonight. TheyÂve done well to get bodies in the way, Nepal, and itÂs another blocked shot, when the goal net beckoned!\\r\\nA first sub for Australia - itÂs Apostolos Giannou comes into the action, and a slight tactical adjustment, as the Socceroos switch to two up-front and the hard-working Mooy makes way.\\r\\n58 min: IItÂs the set piece once again that undoes Nepal - Souttar again rises highest to head goalwards. ItÂs not the most convincing of headers, but it clips a player in blue en route to goal, and trickles agonisingly past Chemjong in goals.\\r\\nA heart-breaker for Nepal fans. A very sloppy and unfortunate goal to concede.\\r\\n56 min: Some good scrapping in midfield, as Nepal look to contest possession. Perhaps a little more self-belief after the break? Coach Kalin might have had some inspirational words during the interval.\\r\\nAnd a corner for Australia, as Maclaren almost trickles home a clever jabbed effort.\\r\\n53 min: An update on the half-time stats: Australia with over three-quarters of possession (77%), 20 shots, six on target and five corners. So pretty emphatic.\\r\\nSAVE! And now itÂs a terrific stop from the skipper - who denies Goodwin a debut goal in Socceroos colours. It was a fine header from an acute angle, but the Âkeeper made himself big and blocked well.\\r\\n50 min: And itÂs a corner to Nepal - to the delight of their fans inside Bruce Stadium.\\r\\nItÂs lofted nicely into the mix from Bishal Rai, but itÂs the skipper Milligan who clears well with the head.\\r\\nItÂs been a little brighter, this start from the visitors. Can they get a foothold into the match?\\r\\n48 min: A chance for Irvine! But he canÂt quite fire a curling effort on target. HeÂs had a few sighters, the midfielder. Three goals in his 31 caps for Australia - letÂs see if he can grab number four tonight.\\r\\nSecond half!\\r\\nAnd weÂre back! Nepal get us going this half, but again itÂs Australia quickly onto the front foot.\\r\\nAnd a bit of half-time cross-promotion - this has just launched across the GuardianÂs various international sporting pages:\\r\\nI enjoyed speaking to JoeyÂs coach Trevor Morgan about rising Australian prospect Noah Botic for this series. All the very best to the youngster as he looks to lead the line at the upcoming U17 World Cup in Brazil.\\r\\nBut, thatÂs the close of the action. More or less one-way traffic, but some fine passages of play from Australia.\\r\\nA few players confront the referee to argue the toss about that disallowed goal, but otherwise youÂd imagine theyÂd be more or less pleased with their showing thus far, the Socceroos.\\r\\n44 min: Another gorgeous cross-field ball sprayed by Mooy, and brought down nicely by Goodwin. TheyÂre certainly using the full width of the pitch, and itÂs had Nepal shuttling side-to-side. But Irvine canÂt quite get on the end of it.\\r\\nAnd is it a fourth to Leckie? Goal disallowed! Replays suggest the deflection came of a Nepalese player, not teammate Maclaren, so no grounds for a potential offside there.\\r\\n42 min: A close up of the Australian bench, who are rubbing their hands and huddling like penguins. It really is deceptively cool out there in Canberra it seems.\\r\\nNepals fans squeal with delight as their side cross halfway. But the move comes to nought.\\r\\n39 min: A slight break in play and some concerns for the Nepalese defender who has bravely thrown himself in the way of a Mooy-humdinger. That was absolutely travelling, but deflected away from danger by the inadvertent head. HeÂs back on his feet, thankfully, albeit a little groggily.\\r\\nAnd as the 37th minute pops up, a perhaps appropriate reference this, fired through from Ross McFarlane:\\r\\nhttps://t.co/7C3V2pMrpK\\r\\nLetÂs hope for football globally it doesnÂt get to that.\\r\\n35 min: This is better from the skipper Chemjong. We thought he might be vital tonight and thatÂs a great come and claim from BehichÂs cross. Some early handling errors, but heÂs settled well, and showing some of the pedigree we expect from him\\r\\n32 min: And it is that man Mooy who fires in a dangerous free kick - it just clips the top of the wall and flies over.\\r\\nAnd from the follow up, a well-driven effort from Milligan, but itÂs well saved and held by Chemjong.\\r\\nIn lieu of some emails, hereÂs a text message from my mum:\\r\\nÂThis team should be called Ryan (sic) Grant and friendsÂ.\\r\\nNot sure if itÂs just the mullet, but somebodyÂs clearly a BIG fan. Bit harsh on Mooy, imho, mum.\\r\\n29 min: ItÂs another corner, and another sense of real anxiety inside the Nepalese box. TheyÂre struggling to come to terms with Australia from set piece - the delivery has been excellent from Mooy and Goodwin, and the height and strength differential is proving very hard to defend against for Nepal.\\r\\n26 min: So, in the spirit of midgame spot-quizzes - we have Harry and John Souttar, brothers playing for different nations. Can you think of another iconic Socceroo/non-Socceroo family duo?\\r\\nIÂve got one in mind, and can happily say I was there for his debut: who needs Christian Vieri - when youÂve got Max Vieri.\\r\\n23 min: And would you believe it! Less than a quarter of the game gone, and itÂs a goal on international debut for the youngster, big Harry. ItÂs another set piece, and the 2m centre back drifts through some paper-thin marking to nod home.\\r\\nHis brother is a Scottish international - on this early evidence Australia might be licking their lips at securing the allegiance of this lad. Terrific start for him.\\r\\nAn early tweetÂs come in re expected scoreline tonight:\\r\\n@rrjparkin Anything less than 10 will be a disappointment #Arnieball needs to deliver double figures #AUSvNEP\\r\\nI was about to say donÂt get greedy, but as that second goal flew in, I had a sinking suspicion this might not be far off the money.\\r\\n19 min: ItÂs a double for Maclaren, but itÂs a goal made in two acts before it. Aziz Behich with an excellent whipped delivery to the far post, where his opposite fullback Rhyan Grant arrives late and then picks out the striker expertly with a fine header back across the box. No mistake from the Melbourne City striker, who grabs himself an early brace.\\r\\n16 min: A corner to Australia, which Craig Goodwin looks to fire in, and again itÂs the massive centre back on debut, Souttar, thatÂs the target.\\r\\nChemjong comes and punches clear this time - thatÂs better from the Nepalese skipper.\\r\\n14 min: A rare touch for Maty Ryan in the Australian goal. Great to see the two Brighton and Hove Albion stars, Ryan and Mooy, making the long journey to Australia, before returning no doubt to Premier League action.\\r\\n11 min: Some very hard passes pinging round - did somebody sneak in some Jabulanis out there?\\r\\nA credit to Nepal, theyÂre looking to press Australia early, get plenty of bodies in midfield and cut out the passing lines. They havenÂt come to sit back - weÂll find out shortly if that proves courageous or foolhardy.\\r\\n8 min: Post! Not the start Nepal were hoping for, and itÂs again the dead ball delivery of Mooy that causes havoc - Irvine at the far post who redirects onto the far post and clear!\\r\\nThe Nepalese defence had eyes on the 2m tall Souttar - heÂs really got an outrageous height advantage on some of these Nepali players.\\r\\n5 min: ItÂs another flap from the skipper in goals, calamity for Nepal! Aaron Mooy feeds in a well-weighted set piece cross, itÂs driven goalwards but Chemjong can only fend the initial shot, right into the path of Jamie Maclaren who was first to respond, and he tucks home from 5m out - just his second ever Socceroos goal!\\r\\n4 min: SAVE! ThereÂs a crush of bodies inside the Nepalese box, as Leckie turns well to pick out a teammate. But itÂs only knee-ed goalwards by Jackson Irvine, before a melee ensues, and is eventually cleared.\\r\\n3 min: ItÂs a fast and furious start, as Australia look to bomb on. The ball pings round, as both sides misplace some early balls.\\r\\n2 min: Oh my! Almost the worst possible beginning for Nepal, as the skipper Chemjong drove a clearance into the back of his own defender, and the ball almost ricocheted over the ÂkeeperÂs head!\\r\\n1 min: And weÂre off! Australia with the ball. Almost a comical beginning as the big countdown to kickoff signed on the board, but the Nepalese team were still in a group huddle. Thankfully Australia elected to play backwards and give their opponents a chance at regathering.\\r\\nOoph. The recording of the Nepalese anthem sounds like itÂs been played on a Casio MT 68. Not that the players appear to have minded or taken any disrespect. ItÂs followed by a gorgeous a cappella rendition of Advance Australia Fair. Nice.\\r\\nThe word from the touchline is that Nepal could line up in a 4-5-1, so between that and a Swedish coach, expect it to be a reasonably defensive looking approach from the visitors.\\r\\nA fair smattering of the distinctively shaped Nepalese flags inside Bruce Stadium. LetÂs hope thereÂs something to enjoy tonight for Nepalese fans, on an otherwise chilly night in Canberra.\\r\\nAnd our players are out onto the pitch, kickoff wonÂt be too far away.\\r\\nÂItÂs an important qualify, my expectations are certainly very highÂ coach Graham Arnold said pre-game.\\r\\nHeÂs increasingly looking like a Wes Anderson character actor, the 54-cap former Socceroo, sporting a salt-coloured grey beard and increasingly weathered air. LetÂs hope his team donÂt play tonight with the sense of ennui of a retired shipÂs captain.\\r\\nSo - without further ado, to team news - and the headline story is a full Socceroos debut for young defender Harry Souttar. The 6 ft 6 in centre back will partner Bailey Wright in the centre of the park. A great occasion for the 20-year-old.\\r\\nSTARTING XI | Here's how we line up tonight against Nepal in Canberra. Kick-off is 8pm AEDT. #AllForTheSocceroos #AUSvNEP pic.twitter.com/JHM9RMlAIi\\r\\nJamie Maclaren gets the nod ahead of Adam Taggart up front, while skipper Mark Milligan returns to anchor the midfield, and Craig Goodwin gets an opportunity to impress from wide left.\\r\\nAssistant coach Rene Meulenstein told media pre-game the staff are very happy with the state of the playing surface:\\r\\nÂThe pitch is in really good condition. I expect that we can see some really good, attacking quality football tonight in these great conditions.Â\\r\\nItÂs a game that Graham Arnold and his staff will Expect To Win (TM). But when the opposition is relatively unknown it does always float some interesting question marks over a match.\\r\\nNepalÂs Swedish coach Johan Kalin has an association with football in the tiny Himalayan nation going back 7-8 years, so he should know his squad and the landscape pretty well. NepalÂs technical director is a man reasonably familiar with Australia n football as well - look out for some Sydney Olympic flags in the crowd tonight - hopefully Gary Phillips hasnÂt passed on too many intimate trade secrets.\\r\\nHi all! GÂday and Namask?r to you, from wherever around the world youÂre following our coverage today.\\r\\nIf its from Canberra, get off your phones for PeteÂs sake, and get down to Bruce Stadium and enjoy it all, live. Although, a public service announcement for any off-duty intelligence officers, maybe donÂt log on the free wifi - the Five Eyes network will thank you for it later.\\r\\nAs always we love to hear from you ahead of kick off - fire me an email or tweet with your predictions or insights ahead of this one.\\r\\nThese two nations have never met at international menÂs level - we could be in for a big score tonight. But Canberra fans, donÂt hold your breath if you donÂt see six again.. (too soon?)\\r\\nThe road to the World Cup is a journey of a thousand tiny steps.\\r\\nSeparated by over 100 places in footballÂs world rankings and at home in the nationÂs capital itÂs not expected that minnows Nepal should pose Australia too many questions. And yet every match against Asian opposition adds more to the SocceroosÂ collective knowledge of this vast and diverse continent.\\r\\nA first game on home soil of the 2022 campaign, Graham Arnold and his staff will be looking to impress home fans, whilst continuing to build in terms of playing style and processes and no doubt taking the opportunity to blood some new talent.\\r\\nOn paper Nepal lack the depth of talent to seriously challenge Australia, but boast some talented individuals - who knows, maybe prodigy Bimal Gharti Magar will add to his growing reputation, or skipper Kiran Chemjong might put on a virtuoso display between the sticks to frustrate his hosts.\\r\\nItÂs still early days on the journey to Qatar. So sit back, Socceroos fans, and enjoy the game played in every corner of this remarkable planet.</td>\n",

       "      <td>And that brings to a close the live blog for today. HereÂs a brief summary of todayÂs events in Fifaland:\\r\\nIf you missed it, hereÂs what Sepp Blatter said earlier:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}ÂThe events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and this congress. They bring shame and humiliation to football and demand change from us all. We cannot allow the reputation of Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer.\\r\\nÂI know many people hold me ultimately responsible [but] I cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it.\\r\\nÂFootball cannot be the exception to the rule, that is our responsibility at Fifa, and we will co-operate if anyone is involved in wrongdoing. There can be no place for corruption of any kind.\\r\\nÂLet this be the turning point. More needs to be done to make sure everyone in football behaves responsibly and ethically.\\r\\nÂFootball deserves so much more and we must respond. Tomorrow, at the Congress, we will begin a long and difficult road.\\r\\nÂWe have lost trust, at least part of it, and we must now earn it back, through the decisions we make.\\r\\nÂWe like this game Â",
       " not for greed, not for exploiting, not for power, but because of the love of the game. Solidarity and unity is asked for the game, for the world, for peace.Â\\r\\nEither just before the ceremony or just after he walked off stage, Blatter bumped into a Channel 4 camera crew:\\r\\nÂSurely itÂs time to go, Mr President?Â questions the interviewer.\\r\\nÂHow are you?Â comes the response.\\r\\nAnd thatÂs that for the ceremony, though everyone in attendance is invited to the official Fifa dinner for a vol-au-vent.\\r\\nThereÂs now going to be a Âgrand finaleÂ featuring the entire cast of this feast for the eyes and ears.\\r\\nItÂs all very incongruous. Sepp Blatter speaks defiantly about cleaning up his organisation. And heÂs followed by a group of yodellers. Then thereÂs a trio of men in suits talking formally, if briefly, about the fight against corruption, Âdangerous imbalancesÂ and difficult days ahead.\\r\\nAnd now there is beatboxing.\\r\\nTodayÂs Fiver has now arrived in literally several inboxes around the world. HereÂs a taster of todayÂs tea-time take on events in Zurich:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}But there are still people brave enough to stand up for the doctrine of Blatter Infallbility. ÂThis is yet another blatant attempt [by the United States] to extend its jurisdiction to other states,Â stormed Vladimir Putin, who seemingly ranks suggestions of wrongdoing by Fifa alongside other fictional notions such as Big Foot, unicorns and Ukrainian sovereignty. ÂItÂs a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as president of Fifa, which is a great violation of the operating principles of international organisations,Â added Putin, without specifying whether due process should instead involve tanks and surface-to-air missiles.\\r\\nAaannd Â",
       " back to the dancing and disembodied voiceover.\\r\\nÂFifa has a credibility problem,Â adds Maurer. ÂYesterday could go down as a good day if Fifa uses it to put its house in order.Â\\r\\nHe warns of a Âdangerous imbalanceÂ in FifaÂs standing as a role model for young people.\\r\\nSwiss Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer: ÂOn behalf of the Swiss government I would like to welcome you, despite the terrible events of yesterday.Â\\r\\nÂSwitzerland fulfills its international treaty obligations,Â he adds.\\r\\nÂI would like to stress that Switzerland strongly condemns any kind of corruption.Â\\r\\nAfter touching on the corruption allegations, Bach has moved on to education, participation and the 2016 Olympics in Rio.\\r\\nThe IOCÂs Thomas Bach is now at the lectern. ÂThese are sad and difficult days for Fifa. And these are also extremely important days.\\r\\nÂWe know that the fight [against corruption] is challenging can be very painful.Â\\r\\nHe tells Fifa to Âtake all necessary measuresÂ to address the grave allegations.\\r\\nZurich official tells Congress: \"FIFA does a good job ... we should be grateful of that despite the actions of US &amp; Swiss legal authorities\"\\r\\nBlatter and Fifa are now (unsurprisingly) receiving support from their city. ÂLet me be clear Â the city of Zurich is glad to be FifaÂs partner,Â said Filippo Leutenegger, a member of the city council.\\r\\nThis is one of the more restrained moments:\\r\\nFor a long time thereÂs been something almost Orwellian about Fifa. And this opening ceremony is doing little to change that sense. ItÂs An Entertainment. WeÂve just had some yodelling. Now thereÂs a group of folk in traditional Swiss dress dancing in a huddle. You can follow the live stream of this bizarre spectacle here.\\r\\nSound familiar? ÂWe are going to put FifaÂs ship back on the right course, in clear, transparent waters. We will need some time, we cannot do it from one day to the next, but our pyramid is intact because the foundation is solid, just as solid as our game.Â\\r\\nNope, not something Blatter said today, but something he said following his re-election as president in 2011.\\r\\nWeÂll have the full text of BlatterÂs speech as soon as possible. Suffice to say, there was nothing you havenÂt heard before from the Fifa president. There was an emphasis on the allegations and arrests focussing on Âa minority of individualsÂ and a promise to clean up and rebuild trust. But thatÂs a refrain that we became very familiar with the last time Blatter was seeking re-election.\\r\\nSame old Blatter. Says he is the man to reform Fifa and rebuild trust. You've been there 40 years man.\\r\\nA few more lines from earlier: ÂMany people hold me responsible Â",
       " I canÂt monitor everyone all of the time.Â\\r\\nÂWe will co-operate with all authorities to make sure all involved in wrongdoing is discovered and punished.Â\\r\\nÂI will not allow the actions of a few to destroy the actions of those who work so hard for football.Â\\r\\nAnd thatÂs about that. Sepp has moved on to praising the dancers and artists who are about to perform at the opening ceremony.\\r\\nÂTomorrow, the congress, we have the opportunity to begin on the long and difficult road to rebuilding trust. We must earn it back through the decisions we make, the expectations we place on each other and the way we behave individually.Â\\r\\nÂThe next few months will not be easy for Fifa. IÂm sure more bad news may follow. But it is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organisation. Let this be the turning point.Â\\r\\nÂI must stress that those who are corrupt in football are in a minority, as in society. But as in society they must be caught.Â\\r\\nBlatter: ÂThese are unprecedented and difficult times for Fifa. The events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and over this weekÂs congress. Actions of individuals, if proven, bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all. We can not allow the reputation of Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer.Â\\r\\nSepp Blatter is beginning his opening ceremony speech.\\r\\nYou can catch up with all the latest on Fifa here.\\r\\nSepp is in the building.  https://t.co/OQunYgM0xt\\r\\n@SeppBlatter arrives at FIFA Congress. Doesn't not respond when asked why he has not resigned\\r\\nSepp Blatter has arrived for the opening of the 65th Fifa congress in Zurich. The worldÂs press are kept well back as a relaxed Blatter puts on his jacket and takes to the red carpet, saying nothing.</td>\n",

First we had the report pointing fingers at everyone but the winning bidders of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, followed by the investigator, whose evidence was used to make the judgement, coming out to say it had been distorted and promising to appeal.\\r\\nAs Greg Dyke said, you couldnÂt make it up. HereÂs a summary of the dayÂs events:\\r\\nThanks for all your emails, and sticking with me through the day. Check back on the site through the evening for more news and comment on FifaÂs World Cup whitewash.\\r\\nI think the journos covering the story have started to go stir crazy Â canÂt say I blame them.\\r\\n\"                                                                                                                                          \"\\r\\n@pkelso You angling for a job in Fifa media dept?\\r\\n@ianprior I'm not at liberty to comment.\\r\\n@pkelso @ianprior perhaps the content of the tweet was destroyed in a fire.\\r\\nScott Forbes writes with a Baldrick-esque cunning plan: ÂAs Michael Garcia, the lawyer responsible for the report is a US citizen, a partner within Kirkland Ellis LLP and bound by US and New York State law ... can a freedom of information request to get a copy of the report be made?Â\\r\\nI suspect not Â since the report was for a Switzerland-based organisation, but by all means give it a go.\\r\\nMind addled by all these pesky words on a screen Â take a look at this video of Conservative MP Damian CollinsÂ response to the report.\\r\\nNot may others have FIFA story as big news. L'Equipe actually seems quite pro Qatar/FIFA.\\r\\nThe French newspaper has not gone big on the story, and certainly not with the same sentiment as British publications Â the headline is ÂNo suspicion on QatarÂ.\\r\\nMarca, in Spain, have the story way down page with the headline ÂThe Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 election were cleanÂ which doesnÂt quite reflect whatÂs happening. Expect Spanish minds to be more focussed if any moves are made regarding their non-compliance with the investigation.\\r\\nBild lead with GarciaÂs intervention and the story tops the New York Times sport section.\\r\\nA mixed bag which indicates just how hard it would be for the FA to build any kind of anti-Fifa alliance, let alone a breakaway.\\r\\nTake a listen to Football Weekly Extra where AC Jimbo, Barry Glendenning, Iain Macintosh and Simon Burnton hopefully manage to avoid saying anything libellous when they talk about the great Fifa World Cup whitewash.\\r\\nA not very revealing response from footballÂs governing body:\\r\\nÂWe take note of reports mentioning a statement issued by Michael Garcia, chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee, following todayÂs publication of the statement by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber, Hans Joachim Eckert, relating to the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process as prepared by the investigatory chamber.\\r\\nÂFor the time-being, FIFA has not been officially notified of this statement and is therefore not in a position to further comment on this matter at this stage. We will follow-up in due timeÂ\\r\\nWant to find out more about the man at the centre of the Fifa storm, investigator Michael Garcia? Well take a look at our profile.\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}GarciaÂs tenure as the so-called ÂSheriff of Wall StreetÂ would come in for criticism over his allegedly relaxed attitude towards regulation of the financial services industry.\\r\\nIn contrast, Garcia proved persistent in his pursuit of New YorkÂs Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer, who was ultimately forced to resign in March 2008 as a result of a prostitution scandal ...\\r\\nHereÂs the full text on that CNN report that the FBI is stepping up their investigation into Fifa corruption.\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}FBI agents based in New York are moving ahead with their 3-year-old investigation, which will likely benefit from the findings of a former U.S. prosecutor, Michael Garcia, who was hired by FIFA to do an internal probe. The FBI plans to seek access to GarciaÂs report, which FIFA hasnÂt yet release ...\\r\\nMore bad news for FIFA - CNN reporting that FBI stepping up efforts in investigation into corruption of FIFA leaders. Story coming soon\\r\\nDavid ConnÂs view of the whole sorry affair is now up on the site, I urge you to take a look:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}[GarciaÂs intervention] was dramatic, edging again into Zurich farce, but no great surprise, because while Fifa had congratulated itself with characteristic smugness, saying GarciaÂs report cleared its integrity and should constitute closure, even the 42-page summary of the report screams the opposite ...\\r\\nFA head Greg Dyke has been speaking again, and this time heÂs been clued in on the Garcia comments:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}IÂm surprised by Michael GarciaÂs comments - it makes a mockery of the whole process if the report doesnÂt reflect what he believed ... IÂm a bit shocked by it all.\\r\\nÂWeÂve always wanted the full Garcia report published, you may have to take out some names who spoke in the belief of confidentiality. ItÂs a bit of a joke now though.\\r\\nÂItÂs undermined the whole process. If the person doing the investigation is saying Âactually what theyÂre saying isnÂt what I saidÂ, [then] whatÂs the point of it?Â\\r\\nAn interviewerÂs attempt to get Dyke to criticise Blatter was to no avail, however. ÂI donÂt think it has anything to do with Sepp Blatter.Â He did concede that it looked Âpretty ugly for FifaÂ.\\r\\nWhich is an interesting view of the Fifa PresidentÂs role in an investigation into the behaviour of his organisation at a time when he was in charge ...\\r\\nClive Efford, the Labour shadow Sport Minister, has been speaking to Sky Sports News:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}You coulndÂt make it up, could you? Fifa investigating themselves. To achieve credibility they must publish the full report ... If Michael Garcia himself is suggesting that this is less than frank, then the only way to prove one or the other right is to publish the whole thing ... Fifa canÂt have it their own way, they brought in Garcia to have this investigation and he is entitled to have his report made public.\\r\\nEfford called on sponsors to consider their position with regards to Fifa in light of todayÂs events Â but ruled out government intervention, saying there was little they could do.\\r\\nHe also said he found the idea of the Qatar 2022 World Cup ÂabhorrentÂ, saying he could not stand the idea of millionaire players and officials inhabiting expensively built new stadiums in the nation, which had resulted in the death of many poor workers.\\r\\nSimon Johnson has finished talking to Sky News now. He said that he found it peculiar that England were singled out for distorting the bidding process by spending $50,000 on a gala dinner, while Qatar spent Â£1.2m sponsoring a confederation, yet that was believed to have had no impact.\\r\\nHe believes it is all an attempt by Fifa to shift the attention away from the Qatar bid for 2022 and on to EnglandÂs bid.\\r\\nÂWe were open and transparent throughout the bidding process, disclosing what were doing throughout to Fifa,Â said Johnson. ÂOthers did not. Bin Hammam did not co-operate at all. If the investigator does not accept the recommendations of this report why should we?Â\\r\\nHe refused to comment on what was and was not an acceptable gift during the bidding process, instead choosing to contrast the England bidÂs openness and honesty with the destruction of evidence by others involved. Who could he be referring to?\\r\\nSimon Johnson, former England 2018 COO on @skynews now: \"We are not going to take lessons in ethics from Fifa\"\\r\\nApparently the Appeals Committee page has been restored to the internet Â but just in case Darragh has emailed with a cached link should it go dark again.\\r\\nFormer Fifa executive, and prospective JÃ©rÃ´me Champagne has had his say Â encouraging more investigation into events before the 2010 vote.\\r\\nMy reaction after the release of the statement of the chairman of the adjucatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee pic.twitter.com/ulGTPanthH\\r\\nOur story about Russia, destroyed computers and missing emails is now up.\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}The man who led RussiaÂs winning bid for the 2018 World Cup has denied deliberately obstructing FifaÂs investigation into alleged corruption during the bid process after it emerged evidence had been destroyed ...\\r\\nBreaking: Fifa has taken down the link to the Appeal Committee. (Thanks Martin Smith).\\r\\nRudy Hulsman (presumably from Belgium or Holland) writes:\\r\\nÂAs the Dutch/Belgian bid was the only one to get a categorical clean bill of health in the report, we should get the hosting, right?Â\\r\\nThat seems perfectly fair to me.\\r\\nI hereby award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Belgium and Holland. Nice easy commute from the UK too.\\r\\nSomething to reassure you ahead of Michael GarciaÂs appeal.\\r\\nThe Fifa Appeals Committee he will be appealing to is appointed by the Fifa Executive Committee Â thatÂs the same Executive Committee which serious allegations have be levelled against in the bidding process. Sure to be impartial then.\\r\\nHereÂs a more detailed version of those Greg Dyke quotes from 12.38:\\r\\nÂÂQuestions still need to be answered. If you read that report it says all the bids were assessed. The one that was the highest risk was Qatar and they won, and it doesnÂt take us any further forward on why they won.\\r\\nÂI still donÂt understand why the 2022 World Cup was given to Qatar when it was quite clear from FIFAÂs own technical committee that said it would be high risk. I donÂt understand it any more than I understood it then.\\r\\nÂThe question about Qatar is all about Mr Bin Hammam and all about whether Mr Bin Hammam was representing Qatar and the Qatari bid or whether he was just representing his own interests. TheyÂve come to the conclusion that he was representing his own interests. I still find that quite difficult to take.Â\\r\\nAsked if the FA had damaged the image of FIFA, Dyke added: ÂI think itÂs quite hard to damage the image of FIFA. What it tells you is that the people who co-operated the most got criticised and those who didnÂt co-operate at all didnÂt get anything which seems odd by anybodyÂs standards.\\r\\nÂAs for the criticism of the English bid, obviously I wasnÂt involved, but itÂs all based on information that we gave to them and that the FA had cleared with the FIFA executives in advance.Â\\r\\nAsked about Russia failing to provide emails on the basis their leased computers had since been destroyed, Dyke said: ÂThose who co-operated the most seemed to be the ones that gave them the information by which they were then criticised, like the FA. Others, who didnÂt co-operate, didnÂt get criticised at all. Well, thereÂs a surprise.Â\\r\\nIs this going to be FifaÂs defence against Garcia?\\r\\nWhen I discussed Garcia with a Fifa director recently they suggested he was enjoying the publicity, and his comments were self-serving\\r\\nMatt Scott, once of this parish, and Heidi Blake of the Sunday Times have this to say on GarciaÂs possible appeal:\\r\\nAhmad Darw, member of the Fifa appeal committee Garcia hopes will overturn J. Eckert's 'erroneous' decision, took Bin Hammam's cash in 2010\\r\\n@heidiblakeST wrote in June how FIFA appeals panel's Ahmad arranged an illicit payment from Qatari official in 2010 http://t.co/rwOVFLZizf\\r\\nHere is Ahmad Darw, still listed on the appeals panel at FIFA... http://t.co/5G3wkcdRnQ Will he recuse himself over conflict?\\r\\nWorth noting that the report goes through each bid one-by-one - although a single bid is conspicuous by its absence.\\r\\nSpain/PortugalÂs bid for 2018 is left out - but thatÂs not because they have done nothing wrong ...\\r\\nThe report says: ÂWith regard to one specific bid team however, the report noted that the relevant federation was particularly un-cooperative in responding to the investigatory chamberÂs requests.Â\\r\\nExpect the severest penalty (Â10,000 fine anyone?) to be handed out to those two FAs.\\r\\nLabour have had their say Â beating the government to it (IÂm not counting Nick CleggÂs intervention, see 10.24).\\r\\nÂFifa has no choice but to publish Garcia report in full, if it expects anyone to believe their claims there has been no cover up.Â\\r\\nHereÂs a handy country-by-country guide to the report.\\r\\nFifa's media dept have just put out a press release about the legacy of SA 2010. Pretty sure that'll knock Garcia v Eckert off back pages.\\r\\nHere it is for those interested:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Four years after the final whistle was blown at Soccer City in Johannesburg, FIFAÂs pledge to ensure that South Africans would be long-term recipients of the financial rewards of the 2010 FIFA World CupÂ has become a reality ...\\r\\nJust spoken to Hans-Joachim Eckert about Garcia's statement. \"I cannot comment, I don't know why he has said this, I need to speak to him\"\\r\\nBruce Cooper emails to demand direct action from all you lazy layabouts: ÂIt is only with global pressure that Fifa will change. The GuardianÂs global ?reach should be used to encourage all readers to tweet, email and call their national associations to demand that the full report is release. This Canadian will be.Â\\r\\nIt is a demand supported by Jim Boyce, Fifa vice-president, who probably has more sway than the average Guardian reader.\\r\\nÂIn view of the fact Michael Garcia has now stated he is not happy with the findings and is to appeal, I await with interest to see what further disclosures will be made,Â Boyce told PA.\\r\\nÂI have always said as much of the report as it is legally possible to publish should be made public.Â\\r\\nFormer England 2018 chief operating officer, Simon Johnson, has branded the report a Âpolitically-motivated whitewashÂ.\\r\\nJohnson told Press Association Sport: ÂIt is a politically-motivated whitewash and I am not sure how we can have confidence in the outcome of this report.\\r\\nÂThe headlines today end up being about the England bid when it should be about how it has exonerated Qatar, which has overseen the deaths of hundreds of migrant workers and which has been described by the US government as funding terrorist organisations.\\r\\nÂIn relation to EnglandÂs bid, I was satisfied at all times that we complied with the rules of the ethics code. We also gave full and transparent disclosure to the investigation which many others did not do.\\r\\nÂAll these things are being said about England when the investigation was set up around the terrible allegations about corruption involving Qatar.Â\\r\\nFinally, someone comes out to defend poor, put upon Qatar.\\r\\nStep forward Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.\\r\\nHe said: ÂI am satisfied that Qatar has been absolved of any misconduct in their bid for the 2022 World Cup.\\r\\nÂThe AFC has always stood by Qatar as we defend their right to host the 2022 World Cup, and this finding reaffirms our belief and support for the country. We would now be able to move on and work with Qatar to ensure that we deliver the best World Cup that Asia can offer.\\r\\nÂThere are matters to be ironed out of course including the timing of the World Cup, but we are committed to get it done. I would also like to call upon all Asian nations to continue showing support for Qatar as we have been doing since they won the bid.\\r\\nÂThis is an important moment for Asia, and we have a wonderful opportunity to create history.Â\\r\\nSome real giants of world football represented on Fifa's appeals committee - from Guam to Comoros via the Faroe Islands\\r\\nOwen GibsonÂs story on Michael GarciaÂs intervention is now up:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}But when German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert today closed the investigation after ruling that there was not enough evidence to justify re-opening the process, a furious Garcia said the summary he had published did not reflect his findings ...\\r\\nGreg Dyke has been speaking to Sky Sports News (before the Garcia news broke).\\r\\nÂI wasnÂt involved in English bid, but the [accusations in the report are] all based on information we gave to them and that the FA had cleared with the Fifa Executive in advance.\\r\\nÂThose that didnÂt cooperate entirely [with the investigation] didnÂt get anything.Â\\r\\nOn Qatar and Bin Hammam he says:\\r\\nÂI find it difficult to take [that Bin Hammam was acting on own interests on not for the Qatar bid]. It doesnÂt seem to add anything to what we already knew. I still donÂt understand why the 2022 World Cup was given to Qatar, when it was clear that FifaÂs own technical committee said it would be high risk.Â\\r\\nAt the time of talking he didnÂt seem confident that any more would come out of the report Â of course this will certainly have changed since GarciaÂs dramatic intervention.\\r\\nÂUnless more information becomes public I canÂt see what else there is to be done. I donÂt think anyone will accuse the FA of anything other than behaving properly.Â\\r\\nHereÂs a link to the members of the Appeal committee that will adjudicate on Michael GarciaÂs claims.\\r\\nEveryone clamouring for the full report to be released now. ItÂs probably worth keeping in mind that that would surely result in lawsuits all round.\\r\\nWould it not be better if Fifa just submitted itself to a proper investigation by a police force, with all the requisite powers to demand documents, testimony, mysteriously disappeared Russian emails? Does this not fall under the jurisdiction of some official body other than Fifa itself?\\r\\nWill Fifa be able to resist publishing the Garcia report in full now?\\r\\nIs the appeal process (an internal appeal process) really credible?\\r\\nIf Garcia disagrees with the appeal will he just go ahead and leak his report?\\r\\nThis will run and run.\\r\\nWe should have GarciaÂs full statement soon, but some seem to be enjoying the farce.\\r\\nThis is House of Cards, the Zurich series. #FIFA #popcorn</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        As Liverpool fans stream into Qatar to watch the Fifa Club World Cup next week, it will be easy to forget the thousands of workers from the poorest countries in the region who have toiled for years to construct its glittering buildings.\\r\\nWhen they take their seats at the Khalifa International Stadium, where Liverpool will play their semi-final match, they may not realise that scores of workers who refurbished the stadium were housed in filthy, overcrowded accommodation with an ever-present stench of raw sewage.\\r\\nThere will be no announcements to inform them that these men were paid less than promised, their passports were confiscated and they were unable to change jobs or quit the country, leaving some vulnerable to forced labour, a modern form of slavery, according to Amnesty International.\\r\\nAnd looking up at the soaring stadium arches, there will be nothing to remind them that British construction worker Zac Cox fell to his death here in 2017.\\r\\nFifa announced on Saturday that the original venue for the game on 18 December, the dazzling new Education City Stadium, was not match ready.\\r\\nBut the Education City stadium also has a story of death and indifference at the highest levels of the game.\\r\\nIn June, a 24-year-old labourer from Nepal, Rupchandra Rumba, died gasping for breath in a squalid labour camp on the outskirts of Doha. He was working as a scaffolder at Education City Stadium.\\r\\nNearly six months after he died, and more than two months since the Guardian first revealed her plight, RumbaÂs wife, Nirmala Pakrin, has still not received any compensation from Qatar.\\r\\nSitting in her small room on the edge of Kathmandu, with photos of her husband on the walls, Pakrin says their six-year-old son, Niraj, is struggling to accept that his father is not coming home. ÂHe keeps asking: ÂWhereÂs my dad? Why is he not calling? When will he come?ÂÂ she says.\\r\\nIn recent weeks, Pakrin says the director of the company that employed Rumba has been pressuring her to accept a pay-off of 7,000 Qatari rials (Â£1,460).\\r\\nShe says she feels afraid. ÂIÂm concerned about my safety. He is using threatening language,Â she says.\\r\\nHer brother, Pradip Pakrin, has dismissed the offer, saying: ÂWe have to fight for what is right. If we accept this, other families will suffer.Â\\r\\nNick McGeehan, a director of Fair/Square Projects and an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf, says: ÂWe appear to have this appalling situation where the families of workers who have died get derisory pay-offs or nothing at all from Qatar.Â McGeehan says the supreme committee, the body organising the Club World Cup, which starts on Wednesday, must take responsibility for the unexplained deaths of young men building its stadiums and compensate their families.\\r\\nLiverpoolÂs CEO, Peter Moore, backed McGeehan in a letter on Tuesday, saying: ÂWe support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve.Â\\r\\nRumbaÂs case is not a one-off. A total of 11 stadium workers died in 2018, according to the supreme committee. Of these deaths, 10 were described as Ânon-work relatedÂ, mostly attributed to sudden and unexplained heart or respiratory failure.\\r\\nData on the number of deaths of stadium workers in 2019 has not yet been published.\\r\\nIn the past year the Guardian has spoken to the families of five deceased stadium workers, including Rumba. Two say they have not received any compensation from Qatar. The other three only received compensation after the Guardian revealed their stories last year.\\r\\nÂPoor people like us cannot hope to get compensation,Â says Johurul Islam, whose brother-in-law, Monjurul Islam, 28, a stadium worker from Bangladesh, died in August 2018. ÂThe Qatar government does not see us as human.Â\\r\\nA spokesperson for the supreme committee said in a statement that in most cases compensation is only paid when a worker dies in a work-related accident. For non-work-related deaths, Âthe supreme committee ensures our contractors pay final salaries [and] end of service benefits.Â\\r\\nThe GuardianÂs findings will heap pressure on Liverpool, whose participation in the tournament has come under scrutiny from fans and human rights groups.\\r\\nMinky Worden, a director at Human Rights Watch, believes LiverpoolÂs players and management should raise these abuses and demand reforms. ÂLiverpool and other teams who play in Qatar should be aware that migrant workers have died to deliver the stadiums they are playing in, and at every opportunity speak up to insist that they are protected,Â she says.\\r\\nLast month, in an interview for the clubÂs television channel, Moore said the club had Âgone to great lengthsÂ to understand the issues in Qatar. ÂWeÂre not a political organisation and itÂs neither our place nor our ambition to go from country to country forcing our values and our beliefs on others,Â he added.\\r\\nThat may come as bad news to the family of Monjurul Islam. Johurul Islam says his brother-in-law paid a recruitment agent almost 500,000 Bangladeshi taka (Â£4,470) to secure his job in Qatar, a fee he could only afford by selling his land and taking out loans.\\r\\nThe agent promised him a lucrative salary, but his basic wage turned out to be just 600 Qatari rials a month (Â£125), says Johurul, far below the minimum wage, which itself is widely viewed as inadequate.\\r\\nJohurul claims MonjurulÂs direct employer, one of QatarÂs largest construction companies, did not provide any compensation. ÂThey didnÂt even pay all the salary and allowances they owed him.Â\\r\\nJohurul has been left devastated and confused by his death. ÂI was very close to him. He had no illness. His death certificate said he died of a heart attack, but I still donÂt believe it,Â he says.\\r\\nHe has good reason to be suspicious. In October the Guardian revealed that in the vast majority of cases the Qatari authorities do not carry out postmortem examinations, making it impossible to accurately determine the cause of death.\\r\\nDeath certificates routinely state that workers die of respiratory or cardiac failure Âdue to natural causesÂ, but such explanations are meaningless, according to a British forensic pathologist, Stuart Hamilton.\\r\\nÂAll they say is someone died because they are dead. If a trainee pathologist presented me with these conclusions, I would tell them to go away and do some more work,Â says Hamilton.\\r\\nThe Guardian has found that many deaths of migrant workers in Qatar are likely to be linked to the extreme summer heat, which sees workers toiling in temperatures that regularly reach 45C.\\r\\nThe number of World Cup 2022 stadium workers who die each year are just a fraction of the total number of migrant worker deaths. Less than 2% of QatarÂs migrant workforce are employed at World Cup stadiums, but tens of thousands are working on infrastructure to support the World Cup in 2022, including hotel, rail and road construction.\\r\\nGovernment data from India, Nepal and Bangladesh reveal the true scale of the death toll in Qatar. At least 1,025 workers from Nepal died between 2012 and 2017, 676 of them from causes deemed to be ÂnaturalÂ. In 2018, 149 Bangladeshi workers died, with 107 deaths classified as ÂnaturalÂ. Between 2012 and August 2018, 1,678 Indian workers died. Of these deaths, 1,345 were described as ÂnaturalÂ Â a rate of four a week.\\r\\nA spokesperson for the supreme committee said the health and safety of all its workers was of the Âutmost importanceÂ. The supreme committee Âinvestigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities Â\n",
       " to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident Â\n",
       " the responsibility to investigate the underlying causes of non-work related death lies with the relevant local authorities.Â\\r\\nIn a statement, a Fifa spokesperson said Fifa, along with its local partners, is Âfully committed to safeguarding the rights of workersÂ contributing to the Club World Cup and the 2022 World Cup. The spokesperson added that Âsignificant measures have been put in place at World Cup construction sites focusing on health and safety and workersÂ protectionÂ.\\r\\nAdditional reporting by Roshan Sedhai in Kathmandu, and Md Owasim Uddin Bhuyan and Salman Saeed in Dhaka\\r\\n  \n",

                                        Fifa has announced that QatarÂs Education City Stadium, the planned venue for LiverpoolÂs Club World Cup semi-final, will not host any matches in the tournament.\\r\\nLiverpoolÂs semi-final, the final and third-place play-off have all been moved to the nearby 40,000-seat Khalifa International Stadium.\\r\\nThe official opening of Education City has now been postponed until early 2020.\\r\\nFifa has said construction of the Doha stadium was complete and the venue was operational but the necessary certification processes took longer than expected and the stadium was therefore unable to host test events.\\r\\nÂThe priority is to ensure an enjoyable experience for all fans, so it was decided to open the [Education City] stadium at a later date,Â FifaÂs statement added.\\r\\nÂFans who successfully applied for tickets to matches [LiverpoolÂs semi-final and the final and third-place play-off double-header] will not be impacted Â all their tickets will be automatically issued to Khalifa International Stadium, and their seats will be allocated within the same price category,Â the statement continued.\\r\\nÂThe date and time of those matches will remain as previously indicated. In due course all successful ticket applicants will receive a dedicated email with further information, including details of how and when to download the tickets from their account on Fifa.com/tickets.Â\\r\\nÂLiverpool FC can confirm we have been informed by Fifa that our two matches in the Club World Cup will now be played at Khalifa International Stadium and not Education City as planned,Â said a club statement.\\r\\nÂAs per our protocols, we will now send relevant officials to Qatar in the coming days to inspect Khalifa International Stadium. We will update supporters next week on any additional information as a result of the change of stadium.Â\\r\\nWhile the late change of venue should not lead to significant upheaval for LiverpoolÂs squad Â the grounds are only 10km apart on the outskirts of Doha Â the news comes as a blow to QatarÂs preparations for the 2022 World Cup.\\r\\nWith Education City Stadium, one of eight planned World Cup venues, not ready, the Club World Cup will use only two venues Â the Khalifa Stadium and DohaÂs Jassim bin Hamad Stadium, which will not be used in 2022.\\r\\nThe seven-team tournament begins on 11 December, with LiverpoolÂs semi-final on 18 December and the final on 21 December.  \n",
       "1427  Job done in Canberra, as nearly 20,000 fans go home happy as Australia secure a comfortable win against Asian minnows, Nepal.\\r\\n76% possession and 36 shots at goal for the Socceroos - you canÂt window dress it, it was a mismatch. Australia looked especially lively early on (and Nepal conversely, very nervous) with early goals suggesting the game could turn into a rout. Whether Australia eased off, or Nepal became more confident, as a spectacle the game quickly ebbed away in the second half.\\r\\nFor coach Graham Arnold it was an opportunity to blood some new faces - a debut handed to former Olyroos protege Harry Souttar - while fringe players also got some decent minutes. With Chinese Taipei to come in five days time, the ÂRoos boss spoke about the importance of building depth at the international level.\\r\\nThe depth is definitely growing, the concern may well be however quality. That will be for another day, however, when the Socceroos face a much more difficult opponent.\\r\\nA credit to Nepal for sticking to the task, but it was a fairly straightforward affair. Two played, two won - the long march to Qatar in 2022 continues to build nicely.\\r\\nAnd if you missed any of the action - hereÂs the full-time write up:\\r\\nThe positives:\\r\\nA hat-trick for Jamie Maclaren - great for the striker, whoÂs translated his domestic FFA Cup form onto the international stage.\\r\\nA goal on debut for Harry Souttar, who troubled Nepal no-end with his height and strength from the set piece.\\r\\nA clean sheet, no injuries, some good minutes for fringe and younger Socceroos.\\r\\nThe negatives:\\r\\nAt times it looked limited in the build up - dangerous from the set piece, Australia created very few chances of real merit from open play.\\r\\nAs Nepal became more compact, Australia reverted more to the flanks. Crosses are by definition a low-percentage play - against more well-organised defences the speed of ball will need to be much quicker and greater rotations and variety will be needed, especially through the middle.\\r\\nA fun stat from AustraliaÂs pre-eminent football statistician, the one-and-only Andrew Howe:\\r\\nalmost missed this: Aziz Behich with his 21st consecutive @Socceroos start in #AUSvNEP - this is most consecutive starts for any player since Alex Tobin 1999 (who ultimately made 22 straight starts in that streak)\\r\\nItÂs a remarkable run - especially given the troubles Australia has had a left back over the past few years (or possibly ever since Scott Chipperfield hung up his boots).\\r\\nAlex Gersbach has struggled for consistent game time over the years in Europe, while Jason Davidson appears to have fallen down the pecking order.\\r\\nIt wasnÂt a five-star display from Behich, but it will do his confidence no harm to keep getting the starting nod.\\r\\nAnd with that result, Australia return to the top of Group B - two played, two won, eight scored, none conceded.\\r\\nThere is of course a key group fixture taking place later today as Jordan play host to Kuwait. TheyÂre the two stronger rivals in the pool, with Jordan the only other undefeated team at this early stage.\\r\\nThere is of course a very preliminary feel to the Asian Football Confederation Second Round pool competition - donÂt forget, thereÂs a whole another round of round robin clashes to come in the Third Round - you do however have to earn the right to participate in that, even if the quality of opposition can at times be a little less than desired.\\r\\nSo - your thoughts on that performance, Socceroos fans? The result was of course pretty clear cut, but did Australia show enough against for when theyÂll face tougher opponents?\\r\\nOutside of an unfortunate own-goal there was very little goal threat in the second half until that 89th move involving Milligan, Irvine and Maclaren. Will that concern Graham Arnold?\\r\\n90 + 1 min: Three minutes added on is the word from the touchline, and Australia push for one last goal, while Nepal for their part drop deeper yet.\\r\\nAnd thereÂs the final whistle. Points secured, no injuries and a clean sheet. The Socceroos take one more step closer to Qatar - job done.\\r\\n89 min: And thereÂs his hat-trick! ItÂs a clever flicked pass from Irvine off the chest, and Maclaren controls well to rifle home from close distance once again. Milligan the skipper fired the first ball in - a well-executed move from the Socceroos.\\r\\n88 min: ItÂs another freekick, and this time itÂs Mabil who strikes it - but it flies just over the crossbar! HeÂs annoyed with himself, but in truth it wasnÂt a bad effort.\\r\\n86 min: A final change, and itÂs the hard-working Bishal Rai that makes way, Santosh Tamang comes on.\\r\\nA set piece to Australia, and itÂs Hrustic whose standing over it. Has he got a Ronaldo-esque freekick in his locker?\\r\\nHe hits it well, but it just clips the top of the wall. Danger averted.\\r\\n85 min: All a little too static from the Socceroos, Nepal have looked increasingly comfortable this second half, channelling backwards to get plenty of bodies in the way centrally.\\r\\n83 min: Mabil looks to fashion something, before it breaks for Giannou - but his driven effort is blocked. It almost leads to a good transition opportunity for Nepal, but Irvine nips in well to cut out the danger.\\r\\n81 min: A fine ball into the box from Mabil, heÂs looked lively since coming on.\\r\\nItÂs patient from the Socceroos in build up once again, but the attempted cross-field ball is cut out.\\r\\n78 min: A chance for Nepal to counter quickly, but the first-time ball wide is slightly overhit and it flies into touch.\\r\\nA second sub for the visitors, and it appears the striker Anjan Bista is making way for the defender Devendra Tamang. Not sure if thereÂs a tactical adjustment, or whether personnel will shift positions to maintain the same structure.\\r\\n75 min: Australia ready their third and final change, it looks like Awer Mabil is getting ready, presumably for Leckie?\\r\\nHeÂs drifting deep, the Hertha Berlin man, looking to work some one-twos. And it is Leckie that makes way.\\r\\n73 min: If youÂre the Socceroos coaching staff, would you be happy with the way playÂs been building up?\\r\\nTheyÂre reverting to a lot of crosses - obviously the aerial threat is an area of advantage - but has this come at the expense of attacks from more dangerous areas?\\r\\n70 min: Some patient possession at the back for the Socceroos, Nepal are now starting to drop a little deeper.\\r\\nA nasty head clash, as Bailey Wright goes down. HeÂs back on his feet, but doesnÂt take kindly to Gharti MagarÂs marginally late challenge.\\r\\n68 min: 18,563 the official attendance in Canberra tonight. Not bad for a frosty eve in the nationÂs capital.\\r\\nAnd we could be about to see a second cap for another rising youngster, Ajdin Hrustic, who comes on to replace Goodwin.\\r\\n66 min: And itÂs the Nepalese wonderkid - a surprise starter from the bench - Bimal Gharti Magar - who comes on. LetÂs see what threat he can pose the Socceroos backline.\\r\\n63 min: A reminder, Australia will be in action again in five days time against Chinese Taipei, some Graham Arnold takes the opportunity to shuffle his pack.\\r\\nHeÂs not looking entirely pleased on the sideline, the Socceroos coach. TheyÂve not looked as dominant since the break, it must be said.\\r\\n61 min: Ooph. Jackson Irvine just canÂt buy a goal tonight. TheyÂve done well to get bodies in the way, Nepal, and itÂs another blocked shot, when the goal net beckoned!\\r\\nA first sub for Australia - itÂs Apostolos Giannou comes into the action, and a slight tactical adjustment, as the Socceroos switch to two up-front and the hard-working Mooy makes way.\\r\\n58 min: IItÂs the set piece once again that undoes Nepal - Souttar again rises highest to head goalwards. ItÂs not the most convincing of headers, but it clips a player in blue en route to goal, and trickles agonisingly past Chemjong in goals.\\r\\nA heart-breaker for Nepal fans. A very sloppy and unfortunate goal to concede.\\r\\n56 min: Some good scrapping in midfield, as Nepal look to contest possession. Perhaps a little more self-belief after the break? Coach Kalin might have had some inspirational words during the interval.\\r\\nAnd a corner for Australia, as Maclaren almost trickles home a clever jabbed effort.\\r\\n53 min: An update on the half-time stats: Australia with over three-quarters of possession (77%), 20 shots, six on target and five corners. So pretty emphatic.\\r\\nSAVE! And now itÂs a terrific stop from the skipper - who denies Goodwin a debut goal in Socceroos colours. It was a fine header from an acute angle, but the Âkeeper made himself big and blocked well.\\r\\n50 min: And itÂs a corner to Nepal - to the delight of their fans inside Bruce Stadium.\\r\\nItÂs lofted nicely into the mix from Bishal Rai, but itÂs the skipper Milligan who clears well with the head.\\r\\nItÂs been a little brighter, this start from the visitors. Can they get a foothold into the match?\\r\\n48 min: A chance for Irvine! But he canÂt quite fire a curling effort on target. HeÂs had a few sighters, the midfielder. Three goals in his 31 caps for Australia - letÂs see if he can grab number four tonight.\\r\\nSecond half!\\r\\nAnd weÂre back! Nepal get us going this half, but again itÂs Australia quickly onto the front foot.\\r\\nAnd a bit of half-time cross-promotion - this has just launched across the GuardianÂs various international sporting pages:\\r\\nI enjoyed speaking to JoeyÂs coach Trevor Morgan about rising Australian prospect Noah Botic for this series. All the very best to the youngster as he looks to lead the line at the upcoming U17 World Cup in Brazil.\\r\\nBut, thatÂs the close of the action. More or less one-way traffic, but some fine passages of play from Australia.\\r\\nA few players confront the referee to argue the toss about that disallowed goal, but otherwise youÂd imagine theyÂd be more or less pleased with their showing thus far, the Socceroos.\\r\\n44 min: Another gorgeous cross-field ball sprayed by Mooy, and brought down nicely by Goodwin. TheyÂre certainly using the full width of the pitch, and itÂs had Nepal shuttling side-to-side. But Irvine canÂt quite get on the end of it.\\r\\nAnd is it a fourth to Leckie? Goal disallowed! Replays suggest the deflection came of a Nepalese player, not teammate Maclaren, so no grounds for a potential offside there.\\r\\n42 min: A close up of the Australian bench, who are rubbing their hands and huddling like penguins. It really is deceptively cool out there in Canberra it seems.\\r\\nNepals fans squeal with delight as their side cross halfway. But the move comes to nought.\\r\\n39 min: A slight break in play and some concerns for the Nepalese defender who has bravely thrown himself in the way of a Mooy-humdinger. That was absolutely travelling, but deflected away from danger by the inadvertent head. HeÂs back on his feet, thankfully, albeit a little groggily.\\r\\nAnd as the 37th minute pops up, a perhaps appropriate reference this, fired through from Ross McFarlane:\\r\\nhttps://t.co/7C3V2pMrpK\\r\\nLetÂs hope for football globally it doesnÂt get to that.\\r\\n35 min: This is better from the skipper Chemjong. We thought he might be vital tonight and thatÂs a great come and claim from BehichÂs cross. Some early handling errors, but heÂs settled well, and showing some of the pedigree we expect from him\\r\\n32 min: And it is that man Mooy who fires in a dangerous free kick - it just clips the top of the wall and flies over.\\r\\nAnd from the follow up, a well-driven effort from Milligan, but itÂs well saved and held by Chemjong.\\r\\nIn lieu of some emails, hereÂs a text message from my mum:\\r\\nÂThis team should be called Ryan (sic) Grant and friendsÂ.\\r\\nNot sure if itÂs just the mullet, but somebodyÂs clearly a BIG fan. Bit harsh on Mooy, imho, mum.\\r\\n29 min: ItÂs another corner, and another sense of real anxiety inside the Nepalese box. TheyÂre struggling to come to terms with Australia from set piece - the delivery has been excellent from Mooy and Goodwin, and the height and strength differential is proving very hard to defend against for Nepal.\\r\\n26 min: So, in the spirit of midgame spot-quizzes - we have Harry and John Souttar, brothers playing for different nations. Can you think of another iconic Socceroo/non-Socceroo family duo?\\r\\nIÂve got one in mind, and can happily say I was there for his debut: who needs Christian Vieri - when youÂve got Max Vieri.\\r\\n23 min: And would you believe it! Less than a quarter of the game gone, and itÂs a goal on international debut for the youngster, big Harry. ItÂs another set piece, and the 2m centre back drifts through some paper-thin marking to nod home.\\r\\nHis brother is a Scottish international - on this early evidence Australia might be licking their lips at securing the allegiance of this lad. Terrific start for him.\\r\\nAn early tweetÂs come in re expected scoreline tonight:\\r\\n@rrjparkin Anything less than 10 will be a disappointment #Arnieball needs to deliver double figures #AUSvNEP\\r\\nI was about to say donÂt get greedy, but as that second goal flew in, I had a sinking suspicion this might not be far off the money.\\r\\n19 min: ItÂs a double for Maclaren, but itÂs a goal made in two acts before it. Aziz Behich with an excellent whipped delivery to the far post, where his opposite fullback Rhyan Grant arrives late and then picks out the striker expertly with a fine header back across the box. No mistake from the Melbourne City striker, who grabs himself an early brace.\\r\\n16 min: A corner to Australia, which Craig Goodwin looks to fire in, and again itÂs the massive centre back on debut, Souttar, thatÂs the target.\\r\\nChemjong comes and punches clear this time - thatÂs better from the Nepalese skipper.\\r\\n14 min: A rare touch for Maty Ryan in the Australian goal. Great to see the two Brighton and Hove Albion stars, Ryan and Mooy, making the long journey to Australia, before returning no doubt to Premier League action.\\r\\n11 min: Some very hard passes pinging round - did somebody sneak in some Jabulanis out there?\\r\\nA credit to Nepal, theyÂre looking to press Australia early, get plenty of bodies in midfield and cut out the passing lines. They havenÂt come to sit back - weÂll find out shortly if that proves courageous or foolhardy.\\r\\n8 min: Post! Not the start Nepal were hoping for, and itÂs again the dead ball delivery of Mooy that causes havoc - Irvine at the far post who redirects onto the far post and clear!\\r\\nThe Nepalese defence had eyes on the 2m tall Souttar - heÂs really got an outrageous height advantage on some of these Nepali players.\\r\\n5 min: ItÂs another flap from the skipper in goals, calamity for Nepal! Aaron Mooy feeds in a well-weighted set piece cross, itÂs driven goalwards but Chemjong can only fend the initial shot, right into the path of Jamie Maclaren who was first to respond, and he tucks home from 5m out - just his second ever Socceroos goal!\\r\\n4 min: SAVE! ThereÂs a crush of bodies inside the Nepalese box, as Leckie turns well to pick out a teammate. But itÂs only knee-ed goalwards by Jackson Irvine, before a melee ensues, and is eventually cleared.\\r\\n3 min: ItÂs a fast and furious start, as Australia look to bomb on. The ball pings round, as both sides misplace some early balls.\\r\\n2 min: Oh my! Almost the worst possible beginning for Nepal, as the skipper Chemjong drove a clearance into the back of his own defender, and the ball almost ricocheted over the ÂkeeperÂs head!\\r\\n1 min: And weÂre off! Australia with the ball. Almost a comical beginning as the big countdown to kickoff signed on the board, but the Nepalese team were still in a group huddle. Thankfully Australia elected to play backwards and give their opponents a chance at regathering.\\r\\nOoph. The recording of the Nepalese anthem sounds like itÂs been played on a Casio MT 68. Not that the players appear to have minded or taken any disrespect. ItÂs followed by a gorgeous a cappella rendition of Advance Australia Fair. Nice.\\r\\nThe word from the touchline is that Nepal could line up in a 4-5-1, so between that and a Swedish coach, expect it to be a reasonably defensive looking approach from the visitors.\\r\\nA fair smattering of the distinctively shaped Nepalese flags inside Bruce Stadium. LetÂs hope thereÂs something to enjoy tonight for Nepalese fans, on an otherwise chilly night in Canberra.\\r\\nAnd our players are out onto the pitch, kickoff wonÂt be too far away.\\r\\nÂItÂs an important qualify, my expectations are certainly very highÂ coach Graham Arnold said pre-game.\\r\\nHeÂs increasingly looking like a Wes Anderson character actor, the 54-cap former Socceroo, sporting a salt-coloured grey beard and increasingly weathered air. LetÂs hope his team donÂt play tonight with the sense of ennui of a retired shipÂs captain.\\r\\nSo - without further ado, to team news - and the headline story is a full Socceroos debut for young defender Harry Souttar. The 6 ft 6 in centre back will partner Bailey Wright in the centre of the park. A great occasion for the 20-year-old.\\r\\nSTARTING XI | Here's how we line up tonight against Nepal in Canberra. Kick-off is 8pm AEDT. #AllForTheSocceroos #AUSvNEP pic.twitter.com/JHM9RMlAIi\\r\\nJamie Maclaren gets the nod ahead of Adam Taggart up front, while skipper Mark Milligan returns to anchor the midfield, and Craig Goodwin gets an opportunity to impress from wide left.\\r\\nAssistant coach Rene Meulenstein told media pre-game the staff are very happy with the state of the playing surface:\\r\\nÂThe pitch is in really good condition. I expect that we can see some really good, attacking quality football tonight in these great conditions.Â\\r\\nItÂs a game that Graham Arnold and his staff will Expect To Win (TM). But when the opposition is relatively unknown it does always float some interesting question marks over a match.\\r\\nNepalÂs Swedish coach Johan Kalin has an association with football in the tiny Himalayan nation going back 7-8 years, so he should know his squad and the landscape pretty well. NepalÂs technical director is a man reasonably familiar with Australia n football as well - look out for some Sydney Olympic flags in the crowd tonight - hopefully Gary Phillips hasnÂt passed on too many intimate trade secrets.\\r\\nHi all! GÂday and Namask?r to you, from wherever around the world youÂre following our coverage today.\\r\\nIf its from Canberra, get off your phones for PeteÂs sake, and get down to Bruce Stadium and enjoy it all, live. Although, a public service announcement for any off-duty intelligence officers, maybe donÂt log on the free wifi - the Five Eyes network will thank you for it later.\\r\\nAs always we love to hear from you ahead of kick off - fire me an email or tweet with your predictions or insights ahead of this one.\\r\\nThese two nations have never met at international menÂs level - we could be in for a big score tonight. But Canberra fans, donÂt hold your breath if you donÂt see six again.. (too soon?)\\r\\nThe road to the World Cup is a journey of a thousand tiny steps.\\r\\nSeparated by over 100 places in footballÂs world rankings and at home in the nationÂs capital itÂs not expected that minnows Nepal should pose Australia too many questions. And yet every match against Asian opposition adds more to the SocceroosÂ collective knowledge of this vast and diverse continent.\\r\\nA first game on home soil of the 2022 campaign, Graham Arnold and his staff will be looking to impress home fans, whilst continuing to build in terms of playing style and processes and no doubt taking the opportunity to blood some new talent.\\r\\nOn paper Nepal lack the depth of talent to seriously challenge Australia, but boast some talented individuals - who knows, maybe prodigy Bimal Gharti Magar will add to his growing reputation, or skipper Kiran Chemjong might put on a virtuoso display between the sticks to frustrate his hosts.\\r\\nItÂs still early days on the journey to Qatar. So sit back, Socceroos fans, and enjoy the game played in every corner of this remarkable planet.  \n",

HereÂs a brief summary of todayÂs events in Fifaland:\\r\\nIf you missed it, hereÂs what Sepp Blatter said earlier:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}ÂThe events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and this congress. They bring shame and humiliation to football and demand change from us all. We cannot allow the reputation of Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer.\\r\\nÂI know many people hold me ultimately responsible [but] I cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it.\\r\\nÂFootball cannot be the exception to the rule, that is our responsibility at Fifa, and we will co-operate if anyone is involved in wrongdoing. There can be no place for corruption of any kind.\\r\\nÂLet this be the turning point. More needs to be done to make sure everyone in football behaves responsibly and ethically.\\r\\nÂFootball deserves so much more and we must respond. Tomorrow, at the Congress, we will begin a long and difficult road.\\r\\nÂWe have lost trust, at least part of it, and we must now earn it back, through the decisions we make.\\r\\nÂWe like this game Â\n",
       " not for greed, not for exploiting, not for power, but because of the love of the game. Solidarity and unity is asked for the game, for the world, for peace.Â\\r\\nEither just before the ceremony or just after he walked off stage, Blatter bumped into a Channel 4 camera crew:\\r\\nÂSurely itÂs time to go, Mr President?Â questions the interviewer.\\r\\nÂHow are you?Â comes the response.\\r\\nAnd thatÂs that for the ceremony, though everyone in attendance is invited to the official Fifa dinner for a vol-au-vent.\\r\\nThereÂs now going to be a Âgrand finaleÂ featuring the entire cast of this feast for the eyes and ears.\\r\\nItÂs all very incongruous. Sepp Blatter speaks defiantly about cleaning up his organisation. And heÂs followed by a group of yodellers. Then thereÂs a trio of men in suits talking formally, if briefly, about the fight against corruption, Âdangerous imbalancesÂ and difficult days ahead.\\r\\nAnd now there is beatboxing.\\r\\nTodayÂs Fiver has now arrived in literally several inboxes around the world. HereÂs a taster of todayÂs tea-time take on events in Zurich:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}But there are still people brave enough to stand up for the doctrine of Blatter Infallbility. ÂThis is yet another blatant attempt [by the United States] to extend its jurisdiction to other states,Â stormed Vladimir Putin, who seemingly ranks suggestions of wrongdoing by Fifa alongside other fictional notions such as Big Foot, unicorns and Ukrainian sovereignty. ÂItÂs a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as president of Fifa, which is a great violation of the operating principles of international organisations,Â added Putin, without specifying whether due process should instead involve tanks and surface-to-air missiles.\\r\\nAaannd Â\n",
       " back to the dancing and disembodied voiceover.\\r\\nÂFifa has a credibility problem,Â adds Maurer. ÂYesterday could go down as a good day if Fifa uses it to put its house in order.Â\\r\\nHe warns of a Âdangerous imbalanceÂ in FifaÂs standing as a role model for young people.\\r\\nSwiss Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer: ÂOn behalf of the Swiss government I would like to welcome you, despite the terrible events of yesterday.Â\\r\\nÂSwitzerland fulfills its international treaty obligations,Â he adds.\\r\\nÂI would like to stress that Switzerland strongly condemns any kind of corruption.Â\\r\\nAfter touching on the corruption allegations, Bach has moved on to education, participation and the 2016 Olympics in Rio.\\r\\nThe IOCÂs Thomas Bach is now at the lectern. ÂThese are sad and difficult days for Fifa. And these are also extremely important days.\\r\\nÂWe know that the fight [against corruption] is challenging can be very painful.Â\\r\\nHe tells Fifa to Âtake all necessary measuresÂ to address the grave allegations.\\r\\nZurich official tells Congress: \"FIFA does a good job ... we should be grateful of that despite the actions of US & Swiss legal authorities\"\\r\\nBlatter and Fifa are now (unsurprisingly) receiving support from their city. ÂLet me be clear Â the city of Zurich is glad to be FifaÂs partner,Â said Filippo Leutenegger, a member of the city council.\\r\\nThis is one of the more restrained moments:\\r\\nFor a long time thereÂs been something almost Orwellian about Fifa. And this opening ceremony is doing little to change that sense. ItÂs An Entertainment. WeÂve just had some yodelling. Now thereÂs a group of folk in traditional Swiss dress dancing in a huddle. You can follow the live stream of this bizarre spectacle here.\\r\\nSound familiar? ÂWe are going to put FifaÂs ship back on the right course, in clear, transparent waters. We will need some time, we cannot do it from one day to the next, but our pyramid is intact because the foundation is solid, just as solid as our game.Â\\r\\nNope, not something Blatter said today, but something he said following his re-election as president in 2011.\\r\\nWeÂll have the full text of BlatterÂs speech as soon as possible. Suffice to say, there was nothing you havenÂt heard before from the Fifa president. There was an emphasis on the allegations and arrests focussing on Âa minority of individualsÂ and a promise to clean up and rebuild trust. But thatÂs a refrain that we became very familiar with the last time Blatter was seeking re-election.\\r\\nSame old Blatter. Says he is the man to reform Fifa and rebuild trust. You've been there 40 years man.\\r\\nA few more lines from earlier: ÂMany people hold me responsible Â\n",
       " I canÂt monitor everyone all of the time.Â\\r\\nÂWe will co-operate with all authorities to make sure all involved in wrongdoing is discovered and punished.Â\\r\\nÂI will not allow the actions of a few to destroy the actions of those who work so hard for football.Â\\r\\nAnd thatÂs about that. Sepp has moved on to praising the dancers and artists who are about to perform at the opening ceremony.\\r\\nÂTomorrow, the congress, we have the opportunity to begin on the long and difficult road to rebuilding trust. We must earn it back through the decisions we make, the expectations we place on each other and the way we behave individually.Â\\r\\nÂThe next few months will not be easy for Fifa. IÂm sure more bad news may follow. But it is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organisation. Let this be the turning point.Â\\r\\nÂI must stress that those who are corrupt in football are in a minority, as in society. But as in society they must be caught.Â\\r\\nBlatter: ÂThese are unprecedented and difficult times for Fifa. The events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and over this weekÂs congress. Actions of individuals, if proven, bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all. We can not allow the reputation of Fifa to be dragged through the mud any longer.Â\\r\\nSepp Blatter is beginning his opening ceremony speech.\\r\\nYou can catch up with all the latest on Fifa here.\\r\\nSepp is in the building.  https://t.co/OQunYgM0xt\\r\\n@SeppBlatter arrives at FIFA Congress. Doesn't not respond when asked why he has not resigned\\r\\nSepp Blatter has arrived for the opening of the 65th Fifa congress in Zurich. The worldÂs press are kept well back as a relaxed Blatter puts on his jacket and takes to the red carpet, saying nothing.  \n",

First we had the report pointing fingers at everyone but the winning bidders of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, followed by the investigator, whose evidence was used to make the judgement, coming out to say it had been distorted and promising to appeal.\\r\\nAs Greg Dyke said, you couldnÂt make it up. HereÂs a summary of the dayÂs events:\\r\\nThanks for all your emails, and sticking with me through the day.

L'Equipe actually seems quite pro Qatar/FIFA.\\r\\nThe French newspaper has not gone big on the story, and certainly not with the same sentiment as British publications Â the headline is ÂNo suspicion on QatarÂ.\\r\\nMarca, in Spain, have the story way down page with the headline ÂThe Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 election were cleanÂ which doesnÂt quite reflect whatÂs happening. Expect Spanish minds to be more focussed if any moves are made regarding their non-compliance with the investigation.\\r\\nBild lead with GarciaÂs intervention and the story tops the New York Times sport section.\\r\\nA mixed bag which indicates just how hard it would be for the FA to build any kind of anti-Fifa alliance, let alone a breakaway.\\r\\nTake a listen to Football Weekly Extra where AC Jimbo, Barry Glendenning, Iain Macintosh and Simon Burnton hopefully manage to avoid saying anything libellous when they talk about the great Fifa World Cup whitewash.\\r\\nA not very revealing response from footballÂs governing body:\\r\\nÂWe take note of reports mentioning a statement issued by Michael Garcia, chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee, following todayÂs publication of the statement by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber, Hans Joachim Eckert, relating to the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process as prepared by the investigatory chamber.\\r\\nÂFor the time-being, FIFA has not been officially notified of this statement and is therefore not in a position to further comment on this matter at this stage. We will follow-up in due timeÂ\\r\\nWant to find out more about the man at the centre of the Fifa storm, investigator Michael Garcia? Well take a look at our profile.\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}GarciaÂs tenure as the so-called ÂSheriff of Wall StreetÂ would come in for criticism over his allegedly relaxed attitude towards regulation of the financial services industry.\\r\\nIn contrast, Garcia proved persistent in his pursuit of New YorkÂs Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer, who was ultimately forced to resign in March 2008 as a result of a prostitution scandal ...\\r\\nHereÂs the full text on that CNN report that the FBI is stepping up their investigation into Fifa corruption.\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}FBI agents based in New York are moving ahead with their 3-year-old investigation, which will likely benefit from the findings of a former U.S. prosecutor, Michael Garcia, who was hired by FIFA to do an internal probe. The FBI plans to seek access to GarciaÂs report, which FIFA hasnÂt yet release ...\\r\\nMore bad news for FIFA - CNN reporting that FBI stepping up efforts in investigation into corruption of FIFA leaders. Story coming soon\\r\\nDavid ConnÂs view of the whole sorry affair is now up on the site, I urge you to take a look:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}[GarciaÂs intervention] was dramatic, edging again into Zurich farce, but no great surprise, because while Fifa had congratulated itself with characteristic smugness, saying GarciaÂs report cleared its integrity and should constitute closure, even the 42-page summary of the report screams the opposite ...\\r\\nFA head Greg Dyke has been speaking again, and this time heÂs been clued in on the Garcia comments:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}IÂm surprised by Michael GarciaÂs comments - it makes a mockery of the whole process if the report doesnÂt reflect what he believed ... IÂm a bit shocked by it all.\\r\\nÂWeÂve always wanted the full Garcia report published, you may have to take out some names who spoke in the belief of confidentiality. ItÂs a bit of a joke now though.\\r\\nÂItÂs undermined the whole process. If the person doing the investigation is saying Âactually what theyÂre saying isnÂt what I saidÂ, [then] whatÂs the point of it?Â\\r\\nAn interviewerÂs attempt to get Dyke to criticise Blatter was to no avail, however. ÂI donÂt think it has anything to do with Sepp Blatter.Â He did concede that it looked Âpretty ugly for FifaÂ.\\r\\nWhich is an interesting view of the Fifa PresidentÂs role in an investigation into the behaviour of his organisation at a time when he was in charge ...\\r\\nClive Efford, the Labour shadow Sport Minister, has been speaking to Sky Sports News:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}You coulndÂt make it up, could you? Fifa investigating themselves. To achieve credibility they must publish the full report ... If Michael Garcia himself is suggesting that this is less than frank, then the only way to prove one or the other right is to publish the whole thing ... Fifa canÂt have it their own way, they brought in Garcia to have this investigation and he is entitled to have his report made public.\\r\\nEfford called on sponsors to consider their position with regards to Fifa in light of todayÂs events Â but ruled out government intervention, saying there was little they could do.\\r\\nHe also said he found the idea of the Qatar 2022 World Cup ÂabhorrentÂ, saying he could not stand the idea of millionaire players and officials inhabiting expensively built new stadiums in the nation, which had resulted in the death of many poor workers.\\r\\nSimon Johnson has finished talking to Sky News now. He said that he found it peculiar that England were singled out for distorting the bidding process by spending $50,000 on a gala dinner, while Qatar spent Â£1.2m sponsoring a confederation, yet that was believed to have had no impact.\\r\\nHe believes it is all an attempt by Fifa to shift the attention away from the Qatar bid for 2022 and on to EnglandÂs bid.\\r\\nÂWe were open and transparent throughout the bidding process, disclosing what were doing throughout to Fifa,Â said Johnson. ÂOthers did not. Bin Hammam did not co-operate at all. If the investigator does not accept the recommendations of this report why should we?Â\\r\\nHe refused to comment on what was and was not an acceptable gift during the bidding process, instead choosing to contrast the England bidÂs openness and honesty with the destruction of evidence by others involved. Who could he be referring to?\\r\\nSimon Johnson, former England 2018 COO on @skynews now: \"We are not going to take lessons in ethics from Fifa\"\\r\\nApparently the Appeals Committee page has been restored to the internet Â but just in case Darragh has emailed with a cached link should it go dark again.\\r\\nFormer Fifa executive, and prospective JÃ©rÃ´me Champagne has had his say Â encouraging more investigation into events before the 2010 vote.\\r\\nMy reaction after the release of the statement of the chairman of the adjucatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee pic.twitter.com/ulGTPanthH\\r\\nOur story about Russia, destroyed computers and missing emails is now up.\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}The man who led RussiaÂs winning bid for the 2018 World Cup has denied deliberately obstructing FifaÂs investigation into alleged corruption during the bid process after it emerged evidence had been destroyed ...\\r\\nBreaking: Fifa has taken down the link to the Appeal Committee. (Thanks Martin Smith).\\r\\nRudy Hulsman (presumably from Belgium or Holland) writes:\\r\\nÂAs the Dutch/Belgian bid was the only one to get a categorical clean bill of health in the report, we should get the hosting, right?Â\\r\\nThat seems perfectly fair to me.\\r\\nI hereby award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Belgium and Holland. Nice easy commute from the UK too.\\r\\nSomething to reassure you ahead of Michael GarciaÂs appeal.\\r\\nThe Fifa Appeals Committee he will be appealing to is appointed by the Fifa Executive Committee Â thatÂs the same Executive Committee which serious allegations have be levelled against in the bidding process. Sure to be impartial then.\\r\\nHereÂs a more detailed version of those Greg Dyke quotes from 12.38:\\r\\nÂÂQuestions still need to be answered. If you read that report it says all the bids were assessed. The one that was the highest risk was Qatar and they won, and it doesnÂt take us any further forward on why they won.\\r\\nÂI still donÂt understand why the 2022 World Cup was given to Qatar when it was quite clear from FIFAÂs own technical committee that said it would be high risk. I donÂt understand it any more than I understood it then.\\r\\nÂThe question about Qatar is all about Mr Bin Hammam and all about whether Mr Bin Hammam was representing Qatar and the Qatari bid or whether he was just representing his own interests. TheyÂve come to the conclusion that he was representing his own interests. I still find that quite difficult to take.Â\\r\\nAsked if the FA had damaged the image of FIFA, Dyke added: ÂI think itÂs quite hard to damage the image of FIFA. What it tells you is that the people who co-operated the most got criticised and those who didnÂt co-operate at all didnÂt get anything which seems odd by anybodyÂs standards.\\r\\nÂAs for the criticism of the English bid, obviously I wasnÂt involved, but itÂs all based on information that we gave to them and that the FA had cleared with the FIFA executives in advance.Â\\r\\nAsked about Russia failing to provide emails on the basis their leased computers had since been destroyed, Dyke said: ÂThose who co-operated the most seemed to be the ones that gave them the information by which they were then criticised, like the FA. Others, who didnÂt co-operate, didnÂt get criticised at all. Well, thereÂs a surprise.Â\\r\\nIs this going to be FifaÂs defence against Garcia?\\r\\nWhen I discussed Garcia with a Fifa director recently they suggested he was enjoying the publicity, and his comments were self-serving\\r\\nMatt Scott, once of this parish, and Heidi Blake of the Sunday Times have this to say on GarciaÂs possible appeal:\\r\\nAhmad Darw, member of the Fifa appeal committee Garcia hopes will overturn J. Eckert's 'erroneous' decision, took Bin Hammam's cash in 2010\\r\\n@heidiblakeST wrote in June how FIFA appeals panel's Ahmad arranged an illicit payment from Qatari official in 2010 http://t.co/rwOVFLZizf\\r\\nHere is Ahmad Darw, still listed on the appeals panel at FIFA... http://t.co/5G3wkcdRnQ Will he recuse himself over conflict?\\r\\nWorth noting that the report goes through each bid one-by-one - although a single bid is conspicuous by its absence.\\r\\nSpain/PortugalÂs bid for 2018 is left out - but thatÂs not because they have done nothing wrong ...\\r\\nThe report says: ÂWith regard to one specific bid team however, the report noted that the relevant federation was particularly un-cooperative in responding to the investigatory chamberÂs requests.Â\\r\\nExpect the severest penalty (Â10,000 fine anyone?) to be handed out to those two FAs.\\r\\nLabour have had their say Â beating the government to it (IÂm not counting Nick CleggÂs intervention, see 10.24).\\r\\nÂFifa has no choice but to publish Garcia report in full, if it expects anyone to believe their claims there has been no cover up.Â\\r\\nHereÂs a handy country-by-country guide to the report.\\r\\nFifa's media dept have just put out a press release about the legacy of SA 2010. Pretty sure that'll knock Garcia v Eckert off back pages.\\r\\nHere it is for those interested:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Four years after the final whistle was blown at Soccer City in Johannesburg, FIFAÂs pledge to ensure that South Africans would be long-term recipients of the financial rewards of the 2010 FIFA World CupÂ has become a reality ...\\r\\nJust spoken to Hans-Joachim Eckert about Garcia's statement. \"I cannot comment, I don't know why he has said this, I need to speak to him\"\\r\\nBruce Cooper emails to demand direct action from all you lazy layabouts: ÂIt is only with global pressure that Fifa will change. The GuardianÂs global ?reach should be used to encourage all readers to tweet, email and call their national associations to demand that the full report is release. This Canadian will be.Â\\r\\nIt is a demand supported by Jim Boyce, Fifa vice-president, who probably has more sway than the average Guardian reader.\\r\\nÂIn view of the fact Michael Garcia has now stated he is not happy with the findings and is to appeal, I await with interest to see what further disclosures will be made,Â Boyce told PA.\\r\\nÂI have always said as much of the report as it is legally possible to publish should be made public.Â\\r\\nFormer England 2018 chief operating officer, Simon Johnson, has branded the report a Âpolitically-motivated whitewashÂ.\\r\\nJohnson told Press Association Sport: ÂIt is a politically-motivated whitewash and I am not sure how we can have confidence in the outcome of this report.\\r\\nÂThe headlines today end up being about the England bid when it should be about how it has exonerated Qatar, which has overseen the deaths of hundreds of migrant workers and which has been described by the US government as funding terrorist organisations.\\r\\nÂIn relation to EnglandÂs bid, I was satisfied at all times that we complied with the rules of the ethics code. We also gave full and transparent disclosure to the investigation which many others did not do.\\r\\nÂAll these things are being said about England when the investigation was set up around the terrible allegations about corruption involving Qatar.Â\\r\\nFinally, someone comes out to defend poor, put upon Qatar.\\r\\nStep forward Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.\\r\\nHe said: ÂI am satisfied that Qatar has been absolved of any misconduct in their bid for the 2022 World Cup.\\r\\nÂThe AFC has always stood by Qatar as we defend their right to host the 2022 World Cup, and this finding reaffirms our belief and support for the country. We would now be able to move on and work with Qatar to ensure that we deliver the best World Cup that Asia can offer.\\r\\nÂThere are matters to be ironed out of course including the timing of the World Cup, but we are committed to get it done. I would also like to call upon all Asian nations to continue showing support for Qatar as we have been doing since they won the bid.\\r\\nÂThis is an important moment for Asia, and we have a wonderful opportunity to create history.Â\\r\\nSome real giants of world football represented on Fifa's appeals committee - from Guam to Comoros via the Faroe Islands\\r\\nOwen GibsonÂs story on Michael GarciaÂs intervention is now up:\\r\\n.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}But when German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert today closed the investigation after ruling that there was not enough evidence to justify re-opening the process, a furious Garcia said the summary he had published did not reflect his findings ...\\r\\nGreg Dyke has been speaking to Sky Sports News (before the Garcia news broke).\\r\\nÂI wasnÂt involved in English bid, but the [accusations in the report are] all based on information we gave to them and that the FA had cleared with the Fifa Executive in advance.\\r\\nÂThose that didnÂt cooperate entirely [with the investigation] didnÂt get anything.Â\\r\\nOn Qatar and Bin Hammam he says:\\r\\nÂI find it difficult to take [that Bin Hammam was acting on own interests on not for the Qatar bid]. It doesnÂt seem to add anything to what we already knew. I still donÂt understand why the 2022 World Cup was given to Qatar, when it was clear that FifaÂs own technical committee said it would be high risk.Â\\r\\nAt the time of talking he didnÂt seem confident that any more would come out of the report Â of course this will certainly have changed since GarciaÂs dramatic intervention.\\r\\nÂUnless more information becomes public I canÂt see what else there is to be done. I donÂt think anyone will accuse the FA of anything other than behaving properly.Â\\r\\nHereÂs a link to the members of the Appeal committee that will adjudicate on Michael GarciaÂs claims.\\r\\nEveryone clamouring for the full report to be released now. ItÂs probably worth keeping in mind that that would surely result in lawsuits all round.\\r\\nWould it not be better if Fifa just submitted itself to a proper investigation by a police force, with all the requisite powers to demand documents, testimony, mysteriously disappeared Russian emails? Does this not fall under the jurisdiction of some official body other than Fifa itself?\\r\\nWill Fifa be able to resist publishing the Garcia report in full now?\\r\\nIs the appeal process (an internal appeal process) really credible?\\r\\nIf Garcia disagrees with the appeal will he just go ahead and leak his report?\\r\\nThis will run and run.\\r\\nWe should have GarciaÂs full statement soon, but some seem to be enjoying the farce.\\r\\nThis is House of Cards, the Zurich series. #FIFA #popcorn  "
