0,Published On 19 Dec 2022,‘Pure joy’: Argentina erupts in celebration after World Cup win,"An explosion of hope and joy engulfs the nation after their team, led by Messi, won the World Cup on Sunday.",".Buenos Aires, Argentina – Football is more than a game, they say. On Sunday, that truism came alive in the heart of Buenos Aires. .It was visible on the faces of the young men and women whooping from atop traffic lights, in dancing little girls with the nation’s flags painted on their cheeks, and in elderly men fighting back tears. In the embraces between strangers. The anthems that hovered over the city. The simultaneous pulsating of a sea of people to the drums of victory. .Football is hope, and hope is contagious. .Argentina’s hard-fought World Cup win over France in Qatar has triggered an outpouring of emotions in the South American country. Joy and relief are competing with deep gratitude to the national team led by Lionel Messi who was finally able to hoist the one coveted trophy that had eluded him. It was Argentina’s first World Cup victory since 1986 when Diego Maradona led the country to glory. .“Bien, Argentina, bien,” one man said quietly to himself, as he looked around at the throngs descending on the Obelisco de Buenos Aires – the capital’s iconic landmark – to celebrate the victory. .“It really is a sensation like no other,” said Marilé Oviedo, 32. “It’s happiness. That’s what it is.” .Tens of thousands of people flowed through the arteries of the nation’s capital towards the obelisk, chanting, singing, jumping and dancing under giant flags stretched across the width of entire avenues. .Anthems reverberated off the ornate balconies of Sante Fe Avenue, paying homage to Messi and the spirit of Maradona – who passed away two years ago – who many believe was looking down upon them today. .“Soy Argentino! Es un sentimiento que no puedo parar!” they sang. “I’m Argentinian! It’s a feeling I can’t contain.” .The World Cup final was as dramatic as they come. Argentina dominated play for most of the regulation 90 minutes, until French phenom Kylian Mbappé sunk two goals within a minute to draw his side level. A thrilling period of extra time followed, in which each side managed to score a goal, leading to the excruciating penalty kicks and the brilliance of Argentina keeper Emiliano “Dibu” Martinez in stopping two shots. .Messi had said before the tournament that this would be his last World Cup, although after this victory he told an Argentinian media outlet that he wasn’t done with the national squad just yet. .The victory set off a wave of euphoria across Argentina, where people have been struggling with an economic crisis and inflation at nearly 100 percent this year. The World Cup was, for many, a necessary reprieve from an otherwise brutal 2022 that had left people disillusioned and exhausted. .Near the obelisk, people climbed on top of bus shelters, scaled the foliage of a giant BA sign, set off firecrackers and sung the de facto Argentina World Cup anthem, Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar (Boys, now we’re excited again) on loop. .The phrase “World Champions” was projected on the obelisk, and a giant banner in the form of a jersey was unfurled down the resplendent Teatro Colón opera house. In Messi’s hometown of Rosario, neighbours gathered around his childhood home with flags and horns. .President Alberto Fernandez said he had no words to describe the moment, except to say, on Twitter: “Always together, always united”. .The team was also congratulated by leaders around the world on Twitter. “Your joy crosses the Andes,” wrote Chilean President Gabriel Boric. “This will be remembered as one of the most thrilling football matches!”  tweeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. .The team will return to Buenos Aires on Monday, where crowds are expected to gather again to welcome their heroes – much like they did when the team won the Copa America tournament last year. .Arrangements are under way for official celebrations although local media are reporting that the team will avoid the obelisk and the presidential palace out of safety concerns because of the sheer number of people who will likely want to join in. .“We’re seeing an incredible effervescence, a display of pure joy,” said Mario Guarella, 80, who came out of his apartment on Santa Fe Avenue to get closer to the thousands of people marching to the obelisk. “It’s the culmination of all that sacrifice and effort.” .His eyes welled up with tears, talking about what it meant to his country to have won the trophy. “I’m feeling unity that I hope can serve to end the divide in our society,” he said. “The light blue and white is bringing us together, like it always has.” .María José Zeni, 43, with her toy poodle Carlitos in her arms, said she cried for almost the entire game. “We always have to suffer in order to enjoy it even more,” she said, standing on Santa Fe Avenue. “I’m happy for Messi, for the team, and for all Argentinians. We always have to struggle for things. Finally, this is some joy.” .Rodrigo Ronchetti, 40, was out with his family, marvelling at the endless stream of people hoping to get to the obelisk. He was quite certain his family wouldn’t make it there – crowds had started gathering the previous night in anticipation. .In a stroller, his daughter Amanda, not even a year old, squirmed in her Argentina jersey onesie. “Best day of her life,” he said, smiling. .Though Messi said he isn’t done playing for the national side, there is a sense among many Argentinians that the end of an era is near. .“I don’t know if we’re ever going to see someone like that again,” said Rubén Barrionuevo, 42, watching from the sidelines in Buenos Aires. He took comfort in the fact that the next generation is in the wings. .“There are lots of kids on the little neighbourhood pitches that play really well. One day, someone is going to come out of there.”",0
1,Published On 19 Dec 2022,Lionel Messi: A breakdown of his World Cup and career highlights,"After inspiring Argentina to a historic World Cup victory in Qatar, we look back at his illustrious career.",".Lionel Messi has finally won the World Cup. .The forward has delighted football fans for more than 18 years with his scintillating, elegant brand of football, picking up more than 10 La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues along the way. .Here’s a look back at the Argentinian’s performance at World Cup 2022 and his career before it. .Eight years ago, Messi came close to the World Cup, dragging his team to the final in Brazil, only to lose to Germany in extra time. .At the start of this World Cup, it looked like another trophyless campaign was on the cards when Saudi Arabia fought back from a Messi opener to beat the South Americans 2-1 in the first of many tournament upsets. .From then on, Argentina grew in confidence, with Messi emerging unsurprisingly as their key player. The veteran forward rolled back the years and was in unstoppable form with seven goals in the tournament – one less than French striker Kylian Mbappe, who won the Golden Boot award. .In the final, he was once again instrumental in his side’s triumph, scoring twice and netting a penalty in the shootout. .The 35-year-old Argentinian also tops the assists charts with three to sit alongside Harry Kane (England), Antoine Griezmann (France) and Bruno Fernandes (Portugal). .For many, the question – who is the greatest player of all time, Messi or his longtime rival and five-time Ballon D’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo – has finally been decided. .The Portuguese superstar, who has never won the tournament, was benched for his team’s games against Switzerland and Morocco after scoring in a fifth straight World Cup. .It was an anti-climatic exit for the 37-year-old, who has almost certainly played his last World Cup football. .There were high expectations for Messi’s Paris St Germain teammate Neymar. The forward dazzled at times, scoring two goals but was also plagued by injuries at the start of the tournament and ultimately, Brazil could not do enough to beat a disciplined Croatian side and exited at the quarterfinal stage. .Kylian Mbappe, another PSG superstar, enjoyed an excellent tournament in which he finished as the leading goalscorer. The French player scored a hat-trick in the final, topping the list with eight goals. .Messi made his international debut in 2005 after winning the FIFA World Youth Championship that year. At the 2006 World Cup, he became the youngest Argentinian player to play and score. .Since then, he has joined his compatriot Diego Maradona as a footballing icon both at home and abroad. .Messi joined Barcelona’s youth academy when he was 13 and spent much of his professional career at the Catalan club. .He is Barcelona’s top scorer and has made the most appearances for the club, with 672 goals in 778 games in all competitions. .Messi won 35 trophies at Barcelona, including 10 La Liga titles, four Champions League trophies, three UEFA Super Cups, seven Copa del Rey crowns, and three FIFA Club World Cups. .In 2021, Messi moved to the French club PSG, where he scored 23 goals and recorded 29 assists in 53 appearances. He won the Ligue 1 title with the club in the 2021-22 season and the French Super Cup in July 2022.",1
2,Published On 19 Dec 2022,What is a bisht and why was Messi wearing it at the World Cup?,The emir of Qatar put a bisht on Argentina captain Messi during the World Cup closing ceremony.," .At the World Cup trophy presentation after Argentina’s win over France in the final on Sunday, Lionel Messi was offered a bisht, a traditional Arab cloak, to wear by the emir of Qatar. .Messi allowed Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to place the robe on his shoulders before taking the World Cup trophy from FIFA President Gianni Infantino and lifting it in front of his ecstatic teammates. .The bisht is a long cloak made out of light, often sheer, material with trimming made out of real gold that is worn over a white thobe. .Primarily worn in the Gulf, it is a garment that has been worn for centuries during special occasions. It is viewed as a sign of appreciation and respect and is typically worn by top officials such as politicians, sheikhs and other high-status individuals. .Mustafa Baig, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Exeter, told the dpa news agency that the bisht is a formal robe worn by royalty, dignitaries, grooms on their wedding day, and graduates at graduation ceremonies. .“So only a select few people would actually wear the bisht,” he said. “They basically honoured him [Messi] by putting it over his shoulders. It’s like a mark of honour, and just kind of a cultural welcoming and a cultural acceptance.” .Baig said it is also representative of Qatar’s national dress – but only on important occasions. .“And this is a top occasion. I mean, there’s probably no bigger occasion, so they put it on him as a mark of honour,” he said. .Baig said he saw it as “an embrace by Messi of the local culture”, adding that it was “a pretty cool thing” for Qatar to do and “smart thinking” on their behalf. .Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary-general of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, said: “It is a dress for an official occasion and worn for celebrations. This was a celebration of Messi. .“The World Cup had the opportunity to showcase to the world our Arab and Muslim culture. This was not about Qatar, it was a regional celebration.”",2

The data pipeline is built with GCP-BigQuery. .Based on our simulations for the 2014 and 2018 World Cup tournaments, Kashef was about 71 percent accurate, with an area under the curve (AUC) of some 67 percent. .To put that in perspective, the random chance for a knockout match is 50 percent – half of the time a team will win and half the time they will lose. During the group stage, correctly predicting an outcome at random is split between three choices – a win, draw and a loss – with a 33 percent chance each. .Predicting match results is not easy. External factors, like team morale or player fitness, make a big difference in how the game goes. .In the quarterfinals, Kashef failed in 50 percent of the games, expecting Brazil to go to the final, while it was also convinced that Portugal would beat Morocco. .In the semifinals, Kashef was 100 percent accurate, while it ultimately failed to predict that Argentina would win the title. .Behind the captivating lure of the footballing spectacle, there was an existential battle taking place at the Al Jazeera offices. .The question: Who can predict a football game better? Kashef, our beloved AI robot, or humans? Throughout the tournament, Al Jazeera conducted a daily poll on our Sports’ Twitter account. .Kashef’s prediction: France win – incorrect .Al Jazeera’s poll: Argentina win – correct .Final result: Argentina 4-2 (penalties) France . .Kashef’s prediction: Croatia win – correct .Al Jazeera’s poll: Morocco win – incorrect .Final result: Croatia 2-1 Morocco . .Kashef’s prediction: France win – correct .Al Jazeera’s poll: Morocco win – incorrect .Final result: France 2-0 Morocco . .Kashef’s prediction: Argentina win – correct .Al Jazeera’s poll: Argentina win – correct .Final result: Argentina 3-0 Croatia . .See Kashef’s predictions during the quarterfinal matches. .According to FIFA, the total prize money for the 32 participating nations at the 2022 World Cup was $440m. .The breakdown is as follows: .In addition, each team would have received $1.5m before the competition to cover preparation costs.",3
4,Published On 18 Dec 2022,Tears of relief and joy as Messi lifts World Cup for Argentina,Waves of euphoria sweep through Lusail Stadium as La Albiceleste beat France in a dramatic final to become champions for a third time.,".Lusail, Qatar – They leaped into the air. Their fists pumped in delight. Finally it was all over, and they had won. .Gonzalo Montiel had just scored the decisive penalty for Argentina to defeat France in the dramatic final of the World Cup in Qatar and become champions once again after their last triumph in Mexico 36 years ago. .In the stands of packed Lusail Stadium on Sunday, those in blue and white screamed and hugged in an explosion of relief and jubilation. What had preceded were 120 minutes of nail biting normal time and extra-time action, which saw France twice come from behind to send the 3-3 deadlock into a penalty shootout. .“I can’t describe the feelings I have right now,” Argentina fan Pablo Ramirez told Al Jazeera with tears in his eyes shortly after captain Lionel Messi lifted the trophy. .“It’s the best day of my life,” said the 34-year-old, who made the journey to Qatar from Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires. .“Finally, we are champions again,” the businessman said. “It’s been too long. … I thought France would win after that comeback. I was shaking so much.” .He wasn’t the only one. .Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni was also visibly emotional as he dedicated the victory to his parents. .“I cannot believe that we have suffered so much in a perfect game,” he told reporters after the final. “Unbelievable, but this team responds to everything.” .“I am proud of the work they did. With the blows we received today, this makes you emotional. I want to tell people to enjoy. It’s a historic moment for our country.” .The match – arguably the most thrilling World Cup final ever – had almost everything. .Argentina took the lead in the 23rd minute when Messi scored from the penalty spot to become the first player to find the net in all four knockout rounds at the same World Cup. .They widened their lead in the 36th minute when winger Angel Di Maria finished a superb team move that started on Argentina’s half. . .La Albiceleste remained in control until about 10 minutes before the end of normal time when French superstar Kylian Mbappe pulled one back from the penalty spot. .And less than two minutes later, Mbappe stunned the Argentina fans with a second goal, which sent the game into extra time. .Messi responded with his second goal of the night in the 108th minute to put Argentina up 3-2, but a handball in the box by Montiel gave Mbappe the chance to convert his second penalty and France to level again. .In the shootout, Argentina keeper Emiliano Martinez saved Kingsley Coman’s spot kick while Aurelien Tchouameni also missed the target for France before Montiel scored Argentina’s fourth penalty to end it all. .Argentina fan Carlos Ruiz said he had never felt so nervous in his life. .“My heart was in my throat,” he said in describing his emotions after France’s equaliser during normal time. .“I could barely sit still,” said Ruiz, who grew up near Buenos Aires but now resides in Tampa, Florida. “It was a nerve-wrecking but an incredible match, and for Messi to win it finally in his last World Cup, … he is definitely now as big as Diego [Maradona].” .The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner had won all there is to win as part of a football team – except the most coveted prize of all. .“It’s insane that it happened this way,” Messi, 35, told reporters after the match. “I really wanted this. I knew God was going to give it to me. Now I will enjoy it.” .“Look at this trophy,” the Paris Saint-Germain forward said. “It’s beautiful. We suffered a lot, but we did it. I can’t wait to be in Argentina to see how crazy this is going to be.” .Argentina fan Augusto Fasio felt the same. .“I can’t wait to fly back home,” the Mar de Plata resident told Al Jazeera in Qatar. “I want to be with my people when the team comes home. We will be partying for a week.”",4

They always make us suffer.” .France had reduced many Argentinian fans to a bundle of nerves at multiple points throughout the game. .At the end of the first half, many were gearing up to celebrate as Argentina led France 2-0 and clearly dominated the match. .But that early happiness turned to anxiety as France caught up, with Kylian Mbappe scoring three times to erase the comfortable lead that Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria had given La Albiceleste. The final score after extra time ultimately saw both teams tied at 3-3. .In the end, Argentina managed to pull out a 4-2 victory on penalties, a nail-biting affair that will surely be cemented in history as one of the most thrilling finals on record. .“I can’t believe it! It was difficult, but we did it, thanks to Messi,” Santiago, 13, who celebrated the win with his family in Buenos Aires, told Reuters. .The World Cup victory comes to a nation battered by an economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation, pushing many to the brink financially and much of the population into poverty. .“It was an incredible game, at times anguishing,” said 46-year-old Diego Aburgeily, who celebrated the win in the Buenos Aires suburbs. .“This team made people fall in love with them for the first time in decades.” .The last time Argentina made a World Cup finals appearance was in a losing effort to Germany in 2014. .When Argentina’s Gonzalo Montiel buried their fourth – and winning – penalty in the back of the French net, fans screamed, threw their hands in the air and hugged. .“It is an immense joy after so much tension,” lawyer Nicolas Piry, 46, said. .For some, Messi’s World Cup victory will put to rest one of the most hotly contested debates in football – who’s better: Messi or Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo? .Ronaldo, for all his accolades, has never won a World Cup – and he exited the tournament in Qatar after his team suffered a devastating semifinal loss to Morocco. .Messi may not play in the 2026 World Cup, but the 35-year-old said he also won’t immediately retire from the Argentinian national team.",5

That was thanks to three breathtaking goals from France’s Kylian Mbappe, who almost singlehandedly staged his side’s unthinkable comeback. .The drama of the match had left French fans sitting on the edge of their seats. .“To come back from a two-goal deficit is incredible,” said Romain Balthazar, a 22-year-old engineering student who visited Paris with friends to watch the final. “We came to experience this on the Champs — it’s fabulous.” .Just once has a team ever come back from two goals down in the World Cup final, and that was West Germany’s 3-2 win over Hungary in 1954, which remains the only time a team has overcome such a deficit in the tournament final. .France fans will take solace though in the awe-inspiring performance by Mbappe, who slid past Lionel Messi to earn the well-deserved Golden Boot trophy on Sunday as the World Cup’s top player. He netted eight goals over the course of the 2022 tournament. .French President Emmanuel Macron, who had travelled to Doha for the second time in a week to support Les Bleus, said he, too, was “very sad and disappointed”. .Macron had consoled and addressed the distraught team in the locker room after the game. . .“Les Bleus made us dream,” Macron tweeted after the match. .Disturbances were reported in Paris as dejected fans clashed with some of the approximately 14,000 riot police deployed across the country for the final. Minor skirmishes were also reported last week when police fired tear gas in the aftermath of France’s semifinal win over Morocco. . .Meanwhile, Argentina supporters in Paris gathered at the country’s embassy, located a short walk from the city’s iconic Arc de Triomphe monument. .“It’s an incredible feeling, with this finale for Messi, because we haven’t won since Maradona,” said 30-year-old Argentinian expat Alejandro Gomez. .In the southern city of Marseille, fans in the historic port district were also left reeling after the match. .“They played incredibly well, and didn’t disappoint, but penalty shots are always like Russian roulette,” said Laurent Bergerot, a 44-year-old engineer. .“It came down to chance but we fought until the end.” .In Bordeaux, Anthony Brebis, wearing a French flag on his shoulders matched by red, white and blue paint on his face, made a harsh assessment of the national side: “We have a young team that didn’t have enough experience to hold out for more than 90 minutes.” .French fans in search of redemption will now have to wait for UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany, the next big tournament in which Les Bleus will compete.",7

Here’s the story of Argentina’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .Saudi Arabia shocked Argentina with two second-half goals in their opening Group C World Cup match, marking the first upset of the tournament. .It all seemed to be going to plan for the Argentines after Messi slotted in a penalty after 10 minutes. Two more first-half Argentina goals were ruled offside, but a reinvigorated Saudi team took the field in the second. Saleh Alshehri opened their scoring in the 48th minute, guiding a shot through Argentinian goalkeeper Damian Martinez’s legs. .A few minutes later, winger Salem Aldawsari cut inside and curled a beauty into the top corner. .Superb goals by Lionel Messi and Enzo Fernandez earned Argentina a 2-0 win over Mexico in a pulsating atmosphere at the Lusail Stadium, breathing new life into Messi’s World Cup campaign. .Messi broke the deadlock in the 64th minute, arrowing a low shot through a crowd of defenders into the corner, equalling Diego Maradona’s Argentina record of 21 matches and eight goals at the World Cup. .Fernandez sealed the victory in the 87th minute with a wonderful arcing strike, becoming the youngest player to score at a World Cup for Argentina since Messi himself in 2006. .Argentina coasted past Poland in a 2-0 victory to top Group C and confirm their place in the last 16 of the World Cup, signalling a return to form for the South American giants. .Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez’s second-half goals capped a dominant display by coach Lionel Scaloni’s charges at Stadium 974 – which was packed to the rafters with tens of thousands of raucous Argentinian supporters. .Messi, playing in his 1,000th game, opened the scoring in the 35th minute, one of few highlights of a lethargic Round of 16 first half at Ahmed bin Ali Stadium. .A second goal for Argentina followed just before the hour mark, courtesy of Julian Alvarez, after a notable lapse by Australia’s defence. .The Socceroos, who played a compact game, scored a 77th-minute consolation goal when Craig Goodwin’s shot deflected into the net off Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez. .Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-3 on penalties in a dramatic, testy quarterfinal at Lusail’s Iconic Stadium to set up a semifinal against Croatia, after their World Cup quarterfinal finished 2-2 after extra time. .A total of 17 yellow cards were handed out in the match on Friday, which looked to be going Argentina’s way until the Netherlands equalised in the 10th minute of stoppage time. .After half an hour of dominating the semifinal, Croatia lost control. Julian Alvarez won a penalty from a counterattack, which Messi smashed in. His eleventh goal at a World Cup took him past the great Gabriel Batistuta’s Argentinian record for most World Cup goals. .Just five minutes later, doubled Argentina’s lead with a stunning run and luck of the bounce in the penalty area. .In the 73rd minute, Messi picked up the ball on the left under challenge from Josko Gvardiol and pulled off another trademark run: dancing towards the box and passing it off for Alvarez to finish. Another special moment from probably the best player to ever play this game. .France had come from two goals down to level over 90 minutes with Mbappe netting twice in two minutes, including an 80th-minute penalty. .The France striker completed his hat trick in the 118th with another spot kick after Argentina’s Lionel Messi had tapped in for a 3-2 lead in the 109th minute. .Argentina keeper Emiliano Martinez saved Kingsley Coman’s penalty and Aurelien Tchouameni fired wide. .Gonzalo Montiel scored the clinching penalty kick to give Argentina their first world title since 1986, and third overall.",8

The beginning of the second half was not any better. .The match had been billed as Messi versus Mbappe, but it was the little Argentinian who was having all the joy in Lusail. Messi — with the help of Angel Di Maria — had tormented the French backline. .With 10 minutes to go, Argentina were 2-0 up and cruising, passing the ball around comfortably. .In the stands, Les Bleus were outnumbered and out-cheered in the 89,000-capacity arena, swamped by a sea of sky blue and white jerseys. Most sat in silence, staring blankly at the green turf below, the Tricolours no longer waving. .Les Bleus needed an inspiration, almost a miracle. .Step forward Kylian Mbappe, the lightning-quick striker who led them to the 2018 trophy. Whenever the going gets tough, Les Bleus turn to their star forward. .  .Mbappe gave his team a lifeline, putting away a penalty with nine minutes to go. .But the 23-year-old was not finished. He followed it up with a sumptuous volley, bringing the score level and taking the match into extra time. It was his seventh goal of the tournament. .Suddenly, it was the French who were now smelling blood. The South Americans were holding on for dear life, as Mbappe was now on the charge. .The Paris St-Germain forward was at his best, even in extra time with everyone around him showing signs of tiredness. .But Messi, 35, had the reply. He put his team ahead in extra time. Mbappe replied from the penalty spot two minutes later. He had his hat-trick. .Mbappe becomes the second player to score a treble in a World Cup final. The last time it was done was in 1966 by England’s Geoff Hurst. .“We are witnessing a big legend in the making,” French fan Thierry Tiquant told Al Jazeera. .“We did not deserve to lose. Mbappe did not deserve to lose. That performance will be remembered forever.” .Mbappe secured the golden boot with his hat-trick; he scored a total of eight goals in Qatar. .“He really tried. He was the best player on the pitch today. I know many people will talk about Messi. But he played better than Messi tonight,” Maurice Toussaint said. .In Lusail, he became the youngest player to reach 10 World Cup goals.

I was lucky to clinch every title in my career, this was the only one missing,” he told reporters. “I want to take this one there [to Argentina] and enjoy it with everybody else.” .Messi had put Argentina 1-0 ahead in the 23rd minute from the penalty spot following a strong start from coach Lionel Scaloni’s charges in the initial exchanges. .Angel Di Maria, named in the starting lineup for the first time in the knockout phase, added a second in the 36th minute following a sweeping sequence of passes to cap a dominant first-half display against a lifeless showing from France. .France, who were looking to become the first country to retain the World Cup since Brazil managed the feat in 1962, continued to struggle in the second period. .The European giants took until the 68th minute to have their first attempt at goal, but sprung into life with 10 minutes to go as Kylian Mbappe scored twice in the space of two minutes to put Argentina on the backfoot and take the game into extra time. .The 23-year-old’s first strike came from the penalty spot, while his second was a stunning volley following a clever interchange with substitute Marcus Thuram. .Thuram was brought on along with Randal Kolo Muani just before half time as coach Didier Deschamps took decisive action to try and change the momentum of the game. .Mbappe’s brilliance left Argentina hanging on as normal time drew to a close, but the match seesawed again when Messi tapped in his second goal in the 108th minute to restore Argentina’s lead. .Not to be outdone, there was still time for Mbappe to seal his hat-trick with a penalty with two minutes of extra time left and ensure the contest would be decided by a shoot-out. .Mbappe’s superlative efforts ensured he finished the tournament as its top scorer, with eight goals overall – pipping Messi, his teammate at French club side Paris Saint-Germain, by one. .He is only the second man to score a World Cup final hat-trick after Geoff Hurst did so for England in 1966. .Argentina’s victory ended a run of four straight World Cup wins by European sides. .The last South American champion was Brazil, when Japan and South Korea hosted the tournament in 2002. .Argentina won its previous World Cup titles in 1978 and 1986. .In Qatar, the country backed up its victory from last year’s Copa America, its first major trophy since 1993. .For France, defeat marked the second time in the space of five World Cups that they have lost the final on penalties since they were beaten by Italy in 2006.",10

We had great chances to win,” Les Bleus supporter Malcolm Joseph told Al Jazeera. .“Extremely good performance the boys. It was not our night. That is football sometimes,” Joseph said. . .After captain Lionel Messi lifted the coveted trophy, Argentina fans were still ecstatic as they exited Lusail Stadium. .Sofiann Vazquez, from Mar del Plata, Argentina, said she was in tears towards the end of the game. .“Today God was with us.

12,Published On 18 Dec 2022,"World Cup: For Lionel Messi and Argentina, now is all",The script says Messi will be the conductor of football’s great show and lift the trophy at the end of it. Will he?,".Doha, Qatar – “Now is all” is a trademark phrase used by Qatar 2022 organisers. On Sunday, it could not be more apt. .The stage for a grand farewell is set at Lusail Stadium. The audience numbers will be touching 89,000. Billions across the world will be watching. .On paper and the pitch, Argentina will take on France in the World Cup 2022 final at Lusail Stadium. But for the majority, it has been advertised as a Messi show. He’s slated to be the conductor of football’s greatest show reaching its finale, and the boy from Rosario reaching the pinnacle of his career. .That’s what the script says, at least. .Sunday’s culmination of the first World Cup to take place in the Middle East will be Messi’s last outing at the tournament. It’s not so much that he wants to leave that indelible mark on this tournament – and emulate the great Diego Maradona – it’s that he, and the millions following him across the world, want the World Cup to be Messi’s World Cup, his last, his best, his only. .The episodes preceding this finale have certainly highlighted that storyline and pointed to that very happy ending (not for France, of course). . .Messi scored in Argentina’s first match at Qatar 2022 – a shock loss to Saudi Arabia. .Messi scored in the most recent – a stunning humbling of last year’s finalists Croatia. .In between, he scored three more and provided an assist that not only re-affirmed his status, his stature and his giant-like presence but also sent non-believers to put their pot of gold next to the blue and white stripes. .“It’s only Messi, wallah (by God), it’s only Messi,” said Mohammad Nahawi, a Brazil supporter left in awe of Messi after the Argentinian’s spectacle against Croatia in the semifinal. .“I support Brazil but I love Messi. This guy, wallah. It’s 99.9 percent him and 0.01 percent the rest of the players [on the team]. Nobody can stop this guy.” .Messi’s is a tragic story, one of incomplete dreams, unfulfilled desires and of heights he dreams of. But for Sunday, the stage is set, the script is written and the grass is being watered. It may very well be the that dream will be complete, the desires fulfilled, the heights achieved. .The ball dances to his tune, so should the sport. But it hasn’t yet. Not until he lifts the trophy that matters the most, to him, to the country, to those billions wearing the number 10 stripes and singing his name across Rosario, Kerala, Dhaka, Bangkok, and Doha. . .“Pfft, no words for him, he’s Messi,” Dong, who travelled to Qatar from China to watch Messi play, said. “He’s been just.. so perfect. And he’s showed us those god-like moments. You can’t stop him, no way. Argentina will be champions and Messi will lift the trophy.” .There has been an extraordinary demand for Messi’s number 10 shirts as he powered his way to the final. It was sold out in some countries and running low in others. .The demand was such that Adidas issued a statement saying the company was “working to get more jerseys to fans so they can celebrate an incredible journey for the national team”. .“He’s the special one, the best one, the crazy one, call him what you will, he’s the one,” said Federico who was born in Rosario, the city that gave the world Messi. .“Nobody can take the ball from him, he’s just in that place right now. He’s having his best World Cup and we’re so proud of him and what he’s done so far.” .As the final whistle blew in the semifinal against Croatia, Messi stood alone at the halfway line on the pitch. He looked up, looked down, and hunched over before going into a bear hug with the substitutes. .He realised he was within touching distance of fulfilling his dream, the dream of a nation and the millions wearing the blue and white stripes with 10 on the back. .France have already lost once in this tournament. But they want to become only the third side to win back-to-back world cups (Italy 1934 and 1938, Brazil 1958 and 1962) so a win will not be handed over on a plate. .It can’t just be about Messi at Lusail Stadium on Sunday. But having seen the trail he’s left behind in the last month or so, and how the peacefulness of a late November evening was destroyed with utter disdain by Argentina fans celebrating his goal against Mexico, it might very well be.",12

15,Published On 18 Dec 2022,How Argentina fans brought a bit of Buenos Aires to ‘Barwargento’,The Barahat Al Janoub apartment complex was renamed ‘Barwargento’ by Argentinian supporters who have brought a touch of home to Qatar.,".Al Wakrah, Qatar – The enticing smell of chargrilled meat fills the air, Argentinian music blares from portable speakers and a game of cards ends with high-fives and smiles. .This is a routine sight at the sprawling apartment complex in Al Wakrah City, southeast of Doha, that Argentinian football fans have turned into a little piece of home. .Barahat Al Janoub, or Barwargento as its current occupants call it, may be more than 13,000km (8,078 miles) from Buenos Aires or Rosario but fans who live here have not let distance get in the way of their pre-match customs and extended post-match celebrations – of which there have been many for Argentina’s supporters. .The biggest was after Argentina’s semifinal win over Croatia. . .Mattias, who arrived in Qatar from Argentina at the beginning of the World Cup, said he kept singing and dancing until the early hours of the following morning because it was a “once-in-a-lifetime moment” for him. .“We don’t know if we will watch Argentina play another World Cup final so we wanted to make the most of the occasion and celebrate until we collapsed,” he told Al Jazeera outside his apartment in Barwargento. .Videos posted on social media showed a fan playing music from his electric keyboard as dozens gathered around him to sing some of their most famous football songs and shake their arms in the signature rhythmic back-and-forth motion. .“The culture of singing songs before and after matches originates from club football in Argentina and we just change the lyrics of the songs to suit the national team and players,” Mattias explained. .Music is not the only part of Argentinian culture the fans have brought with them to Qatar. Pre-match singing and post-match celebrations are always paired with a group barbecue because all the singing and jumping require energy, Mattias says. .Be it some chicken and vegetables cooked by a few friends, or whole lambs shared among large groups, some kind of grilling has to be done to complete the list of Argentinian match-day rituals. .Tatiana Quartucci, who travelled to Qatar from Rosario, said barbecues go along with every special occasion back in Argentina. And no occasion can be more momentous than a World Cup final. .“On Sunday, we will all dress up in our Argentina shirts, gather in the centre and have a big barbecue to last us until the end of the match,” Quartucci said. .Free shuttle buses arranged by tournament organisers will transport the fans to Lusail Stadium. If videos posted before Argentina’s earlier knockout games are anything to go by, the buses will shake with the ferocity of singing and dancing fans all along the 45km (28 miles) journey. .“We start singing before boarding the buses and don’t stop until we reach the stadium,” Mattias said, adding that the singing resumes inside the stadium before and carries on in Barwargento until after sunrise. .According to the Argentinian embassy in Doha, at least 35,000 Albiceleste fans have made the long journey to Qatar. While some left after the first few matches, most stayed to rally around their team in the knockout stages. .Argentinian flags hang from balconies, lamp posts and even large rubbish bins in every corner of the Barwargento apartment complex. Some of these flags have images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi printed on them, while others simply indicate which part of Argentina the fans have come from. .“We have brought our towns, villages and football clubs with us to show that all of Argentina is behind the team,” Mauricio, a fan who travelled from Argentina’s southernmost city of Ushuaia, said while holding up his island’s flag. .Mattias, who comes from Rosario, admitted that nerves will start jangling once the countdown to the final approaches but it will not stop him from belting out “Vamos Argentina” at the top of his lungs as he boards the bus on Sunday afternoon. .“We are here in big numbers and we are here to win the World Cup,” he said with a raised fist. .While brightly-coloured buses in tournament livery will transport the fans, they’re hope “La Scaloneta” will take Lionel Messi and his team to the promised land. .In recent years, under the leadership of coach Lionel Scaloni, the Argentinians got a new nickname – La Scaloneta, a combination of “Scaloni” with the word for van or bus (camioneta) “the Scaloni Bus”, or the bus driven by Scaloni. .Barwargento has its own La Scaloneta – a small white van with images of Diego Maradona and Messi on the back. A large Argentinian flag is draped over one corner while the front is painted in the blue and white of the country. .La Scaloneta, according to Mattias, represents the dream of millions of Argentinians. The driving force behind the dream is coach Lionel Scaloni. .“Scaloni has taken the team to unprecedented success since taking charge in 2018, and we are sure that he is the one who will drive us to glory,” he said.",15

He watched the match alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino. .The president’s support for the French team is symbolic of a football-obsessed nation, which is riding a high as it stands on the precipice of winning back-to-back World Cups. .“I feel very proud of my country. I’m very happy,” Macron told reporters after the match against Morocco. .“I want the French to enjoy this simple happiness.” .Macron’s 13,000km (8,000 miles) round trip to Qatar will be worth it though if the French side can seize the country’s third World Cup title. .“Bring her back?” he tweeted on Wednesday, referencing the trophy that the French call the “Coupe Du Monde”. . .Macron also caught some heat for supporting Les Bleus in person. Climate activists lashed out at the French leader for taking the six-hour one-way trip to Doha, which they pointed out as environmentally harmful. .“We thought that it was a shocking failure of leadership that Emmanuel Macron would go watch football” instead of attending a United Nations biodiversity conference in Canada, Oscar Soria, the campaign director for global activism non-profit Avaaz, said on Twitter on December 14. .Macron was unapologetic. .“I’m backing the France team and I think that the French are too,” Macron said at a European summit in Brussels on Thursday. .In France, the pre-match mood has reached fever pitch following the win over Morocco and as fans eagerly awaited Sunday’s match. More than 20 million viewers tuned in to watch the semifinal on France’s TF1 television, a historic figure. . .On Wednesday evening in Paris, fans spilled into Champs-Élysées by the thousands, with many singing “we are in the final” and carrying French flags and firing red flares. Cars circled the iconic Arc de Triomphe, raising a symphony of honking horns. .Riot police, who were stationed in heavy numbers along the boulevards earlier this week, fired tear gas at times to control the pulsating crowd. French authorities have since called for Champs-Élysées’s closure ahead of Sunday’s game and thousands of riot police are expected to be deployed across Paris in anticipation of another seismic crowd. .Elsewhere in France, in the northern city of Compiegne, fans gathered in a gymnasium to watch France’s World Cup campaign. .“Sunday is just a formality, the cup is already in France,” said Karine, 28. .France, energised by an unrelenting Kylian Mbappe, who is eying the Golden Boot trophy — and is in stride with Lionel Messi — has netted five goals so far in the World Cup. .Even if Mbappe does not lift the Coupe Du Monde on Sunday, he has already inspired a generation of young French football players. .“It motivates me, boosts me, makes me want to work even harder,” 12-year-old Yacine Ngamatah, who plays for Paris club team AS Bondy, which Mbappe played for as a boyhood prodigy, told The Associated Press news agency. .Ngamatah, who scored four of his team’s 10 goals on Saturday versus a club from a different suburb of Paris, is one of the countless young French players who hope to now follow in Mbappe’s footsteps. .“When I watch the France team I get all emotional, because I think maybe one day my kid, too, will be with them,” said parent Rabiah Bertrand, whose 12-year-old son Ilan was also playing on Saturday. .In Doha, French fans who made the trip to the Gulf nation were also wildly optimistic about Les Bleus’ odds against Messi and his Argentinian colleagues. .“It’s going to be very tough against Argentina but I think we can do it,” a French fan said outside Al Bayt Stadium. “We have a great defence and as for our attack, when we play well, we’re unstoppable.” .Closing ceremonies kick off at Lusail Stadium at 4:30pm (13:30 GMT) and the France-Argentina final is scheduled to get under way at 6pm (15:00 GMT).",18

As he prepares to watch Sunday’s World Cup final between Argentina and France, he has resorted to superstition to help his team win. .The 26-year-old software engineer is usually a sceptic and doesn’t believe in any divine intervention or luck, but he said the jersey he wore for Argentina’s first match brought bad luck. .“Argentina lost against the Saudis,” Imam told Al Jazeera. “Since then, I have switched to an old jersey, and they are on a winning streak.” .Rohan Ahmed, meanwhile, arranged a special prayer on Friday for Argentina’s victory at a local shrine in the port city of Chattagram. Dozens of other Argentina fans joined him. .“I would slaughter two cows and throw a ‘Mezban’ [a traditional Chattagram feast] if Argentina wins the World Cup,” Ahmed, 39, a shipping agent, told Al Jazeera. .Ahmed’s and Imam’s fervour for La Albiceleste, as the Argentine football team is known, defies logic. Their country is thousands of kilometres away from Argentina, and the economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries are weak. .However, football transcends borders, and perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in this South Asian country, where a large chunk of its 170 million people become de facto Argentines every four years. They wear light blue and white jerseys and support the team and its players with the same zeal as Argentines. .Bangladesh’s love for Argentina’s football team is at least four decades old, but this year, it grabbed the attention of the world like never before – from FIFA tweeting a clip of thousands of Bangladeshis celebrating Argentina’s goal against Mexico to global football star Gary Lineker expressing surprise at such fandom. .Argentinians also took notice of the devotion for their football team in a faraway land and decided to return the favour. They opened a Facebook group for Argentina fans of Bangladesh’s cricket team and started watching the sport, in which Bangladesh is considered an emerging powerhouse. Within two weeks, the group attracted nearly 200,000 members. .In another surprising gesture, Santiago Cafiero, Argentina’s foreign minister, tweeted that his country will push to reopen its embassy in Bangladesh, which has been closed since 1978. .“It feels great that Argentine people now know how crazy we are about Messi and their football team,” Sifat Mehedi, one of the moderators of the Facebook group, told Al Jazeera. .There are dozens of Facebook groups in Bangladesh, but this one is the largest with more than a half-million members. .“Yes, we rank 192 in the FIFA rankings, but our people are some of the most passionate football fans,” Mehedi said. “I would say quadrennial fans, though, as this whole football frenzy is centered on the World Cup.” .Mehedi said social media has played a big part in putting Bangladesh on the football fandom map. .“These days, any post or video can go viral,” he said. “You never know. I don’t think Bangladesh would have gotten the attention of Argentina or the whole world if FIFA didn’t share that video – at least of this scale.” .“After all, Bangladeshis have been supporting Argentina since the Maradona magic in 1986,” Mehedi said. .Football legends Diego Maradona of Argentina and Pele of Brazil are household names in South Asian countries such as Bangladesh. Expatriates from the region, who form a large chunk of Qatar’s population, have rallied behind Latin American countries, mainly Brazil and Argentina, in the current World Cup. .Football’s history in the Bengali-speaking region of the Indian subcontinent goes back to the late 19th century when its British colonial rulers introduced the sport in Calcutta, then the capital of British India and now Kolkata, Bengal state’s main city. .The eastern part of Bengal became part of Pakistan in 1947 when the Indian subcontinent achieved independence from Britain. But nearly three decades later, East Pakistan, as it was known then, seceded to become Bangladesh. .Football’s popularity rose in Bangladesh in the mid-1980s after televisions became widely available, and the first World Cup that most Bangladeshis watched was the one in 1986, journalist Syed Faiz Ahmed said. .“The 1986 World Cup also saw the emergence of a superhero – Diego Maradona,” Ahmed said. “People have been searching for such a football deity, and the Argentine maestro fulfilled it with his exquisite style, revolutionary air and tremendous passion.” .He said Bangladeshis’ love for Maradona and Argentina continued even though the Albicelestes haven’t won another World Cup since then. .Bangladeshis’ support for Argentina has risen to a new level since the arrival of Lionel Messi, Ahmed said .Sports commentator Shahnoor Rabbani told Al Jazeera that their love for Messi even supersedes that for Maradona. .“This is because people now can follow and watch European club football all through the year and even the personal life of stars like Messi through social media,” he said. .“You cannot but fall in love with Messi if you love football,” Rabbani said. “He is arguably the greatest player of all time, and he not having a World Cup is a loss for football.”",20

Sunday’s upcoming final against reigning champions France is likely to be the 35-year-old Argentinian’s last chance to win that title, after playing in a total of five World Cups. .Messi and Argentina’s last World Cup final was in 2014 in Brazil, where they lost 1-0 to Germany in extra time. .Almesawy, who has been living in Qatar for 25 years, told Al Jazeera how good the FIFA World Cup has been for him and for the country he calls home, as football fever and tourism have gripped the diminutive gulf nation over the past several weeks. .“I wish the World Cup would could take place every four years in Doha,” he said. “It’s been really good for me personally and professionally,” he said. .Since the World Cup kicked off last month, Almesawy said he has not taken a single day off. Despite the gruelling schedule, he said his art was “everything” to him. .“I come in at 3-4pm (12:00-13:00 GMT) and I’m supposed to leave at 10pm (19:00 GMT). But I just keep drawing for hours after,” he said. .“It’s my life. I love what I do.”",21
22,Published On 17 Dec 2022,Argentina vs France final preview: World Cup 2022,"Much more than a Messi vs Mbappe clash, the World Cup final will be a date with history for Argentina and France.",".Ahead of Sunday’s World Cup final, hot take after hot take has focused on the battle of the Number 10s: Argentina’s Lionel Messi and France’s Kylian Mbappe. .Messi – the Magician, the PlayStation footballer – quite possibly the best the world has ever seen, is heading towards retirement. Mbappe, the prodigious talent who has scored only two fewer World Cup goals than Messi, but is aged just 23 and is poised to take the 35-year-old Argentinian’s mantle as the best player in the world. .But it is, naturally, more complicated than that. . .Argentina teams of recent years may have been built entirely around Messi but as his years advance, his role in La Albiceleste has developed beyond that of nonstop goal machine and into playmaker supreme, empowering his teammates and waiting for that perfect moment to unleash a little magic. And it works. .Football is a team game, and Messi’s Argentina understand that. .Likewise, France is more than Mbappe. Had they had some of their global superstars such as the injured Karim Benzema, Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante playing, there’s no guarantee the 2018 winners would have made it this far. Due to their absence, the attention of the world’s press, as well as that of defensive lines across the tournament, has been on Mbappe. And that has allowed the super-versatile Antoine Griezmann and the veteran performer Olivier Giroud the time and space to shine. .“Tomorrow’s game is Argentina against France, much more than Messi against Mbappe,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni told reporters on Saturday when asked about the two superstar and PSG teammates who have both scored five goals so far in the tournament in Qatar. .“I think that both teams have the weapons they need and that the match can be decided by other players and not necessarily by those two. Leo [Messi] is doing well and let’s hope the match goes our way, but it’s a game between Argentina and France, and there are many players that can decide the game.” . .France, meanwhile, received a boost on Saturday, with several players who had been out of action for the past few days with a virus returning to the team’s training session. Adrien Rabiot and Dayot Upamecano missed France’s 2-0 semifinal victory over Morocco, while Raphael Varane, Ibrahima Konate and Kingsley Coman were absent for the past two days of training. But all five players will be available to head coach Didier Deschamps – one of only three men to have won the World Cup both as a player and a coach. .“The France team has always been for me the most beautiful thing that has happened to me in my professional life,” Deschamps told reporters on Saturday. .“Already I had a great experience as a player, and now it’s my privilege to experience it as a coach. Now, it’s been 10 years, and it’s really the passion, the very, very high level. So, I’m good, very good, very happy to be in this position.” .Both Argentina and France have won the World Cup twice in their history – in 1978 and 1986 for the former, and 1998 and 2018 for the latter. .The crowds in Doha, however, seem to believe Argentina’s day for a third victory has come, and the nearly 90,000-capacity Lusail Stadium will be dominated by the white and sky-blue. .The prospect of Messi finally winning a World Cup in his last tournament brought extra flights of Argentina fans to Qatar, with at least 40,000 Argentinians estimated to be in the stadium. .“We all believe this will be Messi’s day,” said Ricardo Schwarz, a teacher from Cordoba, his voice hoarse from singing the Argentina fan songs for more than an hour. .“I still don’t have a ticket, but I have not given up hope yet,” he added. “They are on the market, but they are expensive.” .Supporters told the AFP news agency that tickets with a face value of $750 were being offered for more than $4,000 on WhatsApp groups set up to trade seats at the stadium. .Deschamps also said he expects a one-sided atmosphere: “They sing a lot and are very expressive. That’s good. It’s a World Cup final after all, but our opponents are not in the stands.” .This is the 11th World Cup final played between a South American and a European nation. .In both the quarterfinals against England and the semifinals against Morocco, the French have come out strong to take a first-half lead and have then been content to soak up pressure and play on the counterattack – a tactic that also worked four years ago on the country’s run at the World Cup title. .Can that also work against Argentina, with Messi in such scintillating form? .“Things always happen in a match for which you are not prepared,” said France captain Hugo Lloris, who is looking to become the first man to captain a team to the World Cup title twice. “That is where you need to show a good team spirit, and you also need to have that feeling of pulling out all the stops and digging deep in those tough moments. .“Argentina is a strong team and there are a lot of other players – a young generation coming through – and you can feel they are all dedicated to Leo Messi.”",22

26,Published On 17 Dec 2022,How France reached the Qatar World Cup 2022 final,"After tournament full of mental strength and moments of brilliance, France hope to win the World Cup for a third time.",".France started the World Cup with more questions than answers after being ravaged by injuries. .But they quickly ended the curse of the defending champions to reach the final, thanks to their ruthlessness, mental strength and moments of sheer brilliance. .Kylian Mbappe scored five goals in his first three matches while Olivier Giroud, who owes his place in the starting lineup to Karim Benzema’s last-minute injury, became France’s all-time leading goal scorer as he launched the campaign with the first goal of their inaugural 4-1 win against Australia. .Following is France’s path to the final: .France started the tournament on the back of a dismal Nations League campaign and fell behind early on but quickly recovered as Adrien Rabiot and Giroud put them ahead at halftime. .They lost left-back Lucas Hernandez for the rest of the competition to a serious knee injury. .Giroud was at it again in the second half before Mbappe opened his account in Qatar with a career sixth goal in the World Cup to give Les Bleus much-needed momentum. .Mbappe tapped in the opener in the 61st minute of a tense encounter, seven minutes before Andreas Christensen headed home the equaliser. .Mbappe, however, bundled the ball over the line with four minutes left from Antoine Griezmann’s cross, sending France into the last 16 with one game to spare. .Coach Didier Deschamps made nine changes for the match as his team were almost guaranteed the top spot in Group D. .The fringe players failed to live up to expectations as Wahbi Khazri scored the only goal before the hour. Substitute Griezmann equalised in stoppage time, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside after a VAR review was initiated after the final whistle. .Giroud opened the scoring to become France’s all-time top scorer with 52 goals – moving one ahead of Thierry Henry. .Les Bleus sealed it when Mbappe netted a couple of last-gasp screamers – thumping the first shot under the bar before firing the second into the far top corner for his fourth and fifth goal of the tournament. .Poland reduced the arrears with a stoppage-time Robert Lewandowski penalty. .France went ahead thanks to a 25-metre Aurelien Tchouameni strike, but cracked early in the second half with Harry Kane converting a penalty. .Les Bleus appeared to be in the ropes at times, but they soaked up the pressure and made their experience count when Giroud’s header from Griezmann’s pin-point cross restored the advantage. .Kane had a golden chance to cancel it out with a late penalty, only for the striker’s effort to fly over the bar. .France abandoned possession early on, knowing too well that Morocco revelled in defending deep and looking to hurt their opponents on the break. .They went ahead on five minutes thanks to Theo Hernandez’s high-hooked volley, forcing their opponents to take the initiative. Morocco played boldly and would have deserved to level before the break. .But France defended with cool heads as Ibrahima Konate proved unbeatable at centre-back despite being named in the starting XI at the last minute following Dayot Upamecano’s illness. .It was all over in the 79th minute, however, when Randal Kolo Muani beat Yassine Bounou from close range after some great Mbappe work in the box, only 44 seconds after coming on as a substitute. .France will play Argentina, who are also looking to win the World Cup for a third time, in Sunday’s final at the Lusail Stadium.",26

Congratulations to Croatia, they deserve their third place. We are a young team that is still learning.” .Regragui said his side, who had the best defensive record in Qatar before losing 2-0 to France on Wednesday, felt the physical toll of an intense tournament after playing their seventh match. .“Sure, I am a little disappointed by this second consecutive defeat, but we did everything that we could,” Regragui said. “Physically it was difficult, our players got tired, it was very intense. We wanted to make the fans more proud than they already were, that’s it.” .Morocco finished top of the group that included Croatia and Belgium, who came third at the 2018 World Cup, before knocking out Spain and Portugal in the Round of 16 and 8, respectively. .Their run was ended in the semifinals by defending champions France, but Regragui has urged his players to back up their historic display by winning next year’s Africa Cup of Nations. .“I said to the players in the changing room, if you want to go down in history then you’re going to have to win the Africa Cup of Nations,” said Regragui. “We need to dominate our continent.” .Morocco’s campaign in Qatar also gave African football a huge morale boost after none of the five sides from the continent made it out of the group phase in Russia in 2018. .“I think we showed our strength, we showed that African football is prepared to face the top teams in the world with efficiency and playing at the highest level,” Regragui told a news conference. .“We probably will only realise what we accomplished in Qatar after four years, in the next World Cup. The pressure will also be greater, there will be expectation around us. It’s natural. .“We made a great achievement but we want to do it again. It will not be easy but that’s the objective.” .Regragui said he hoped their performance in Qatar would leave a lasting legacy for African football. .“Through experience, you get stronger and I hope we learn and grow and build in our children in Africa a football DNA that lasts,” he said. “We have now allowed children to dream, dream of being footballers and going to the World Cup. That is priceless. As for the impact in our country, we have set the bar high.” .The next World Cup in 2026, held across Canada, Mexico and the United States, will be expanded to 48 teams and Africa will have at least nine slots – four more than at present. .“With nine participants, we’re going to learn. In 15, 20 years, I’m sure an African team will win the World Cup because we’ll have learned,” said Regragui. .“We have a stage to get past. We need to build on that, with hard work and desire. This DNA is not just being built for Morocco, but for the continent.”",27
28,Published On 17 Dec 2022,A second chance: How Argentina reached the World Cup final again,Argentina’s Lionel Messi hopes to bring the trophy home at his last World Cup game as they face France in the final.,".Pre-tournament favourites Argentina stumbled at the first hurdle before getting their act together to storm into another final, led by their inspirational skipper Lionel Messi who has moved to the top of the tournament’s scoring charts. .Eight years ago, Messi dragged Argentina to the World Cup final only to lose to Germany but this time he has a supporting cast and a tactically astute coach in Lionel Scaloni who has guided them to the showpiece match in Qatar. .Here is how Argentina reached the World Cup 2022 final: .Argentina came into the tournament on the back of a 36-match unbeaten run and the last thing Scaloni’s side expected was to suffer what was statistically the biggest shock in World Cup history when Saudi Arabia beat them 2-1. .Messi scored a 10th-minute penalty in the first half where Argentina had three goals disallowed for offside before the Saudis struck twice in the second half to stun the South American champions. .Against Mexico, Messi matched Diego Maradona’s record of 21 matches and eight goals at the World Cup. .With the match deadlocked at 0-0 after more than an hour, Messi picked his moment and then picked his spot, firing home from 20 metres to beat goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa by the narrowest of margins. .Substitute Enzo Fernandez scored with another sublime strike to seal the points. .In a match between Barcelona’s past and present, it was the club’s record scorer Messi who saw his side triumph while Robert Lewandowski, Barca’s top scorer this season, finished the game without a shot on goal. .Messi was fortunate to win a controversial penalty after a VAR check but missed from the spot as goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny kept his cool and denied the Argentinian skipper. .But, despite the miss, Messi was at the heart of Argentina’s attacks and ran the show in his free role up front while Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez scored to ensure their side topped the group. .The stars seemed to align for Messi in their last-16 clash with Australia as he scored in his thousandth match to move past Maradona’s World Cup tally. .The goal was vintage Messi, almost as if time stood still for everyone else except the 35-year-old, who reacted quickly to a short layoff in little space to curl the ball home even as four Australian defenders tried to close the gap. .Alvarez made it 2-0 but an own goal from Fernandez set up a tense finish in which Argentina clung on for the victory. .Four goals, an equaliser at the death, brawls with team benches emptying out, a tense penalty shootout, accusations of unsportsmanlike conduct, 16 yellow cards and one red card – the Netherlands-Argentina game had it all. .A shell-shocked Argentina recovered from the last-gasp equaliser and in the shootout, goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez made two saves before Lautaro Martinez finished things off to eliminate the Dutch in an ill-tempered game. .A match against Croatia, a team who had not won a knockout game in normal time since 1998, was set to test Argentina but they passed with flying colours as Messi almost single-handedly dispatched the 2018 runners-up. .Alvarez earned the penalty that Messi converted with aplomb and also scored twice, his first goal – a fantastic solo run from the halfway line to beat three defenders. .But once again it was Messi running things, setting Alvarez through on goal with the crucial touch before his own run from the halfway line and dribble past defender Josko Gvardiol set up his young strike partner for the easy finish. .Argentina will play holders France in the final on Sunday.",28

Earlier this year, Messi said that it was his favourite football chant and a video of him singing some of the words went viral online. . .But what the fans and players are singing is an adapted version of the 2003 tune Muchachos by the Buenos Aires punk band La Mosca. .The lyrics have been rewritten by Argentina supporter Fernando Ramos. Translated into English, the song goes something like this: .I was born in Argentina
land of Diego and Lionel,
of the kids of Malvinas,
that I will never forget.
I can’t explain it to you
because you won’t understand
the finals we lost,
How many years have I mourned them .But that’s over
because in the Maracana,
the final with the brazucas,
dad beat them again.
Boys, now we got excited again,
I want to win the third
I want to be world champion
and Diego, in the sky we can see him,
with Don Diego and with la Tota,
encouraging Lionel.  .Buenos Aires resident Martin Montalto told Al Jazeera that every Argentine recognises the song. .“It makes me so emotional when I hear it, I get goosebumps,” the 23-year-old said. “The energy in the stadium just reaches a crazy level when people start singing Muchachos. You almost feel like crying… but with happy tears.” .Juan, another Argentina fan, said the song gave him “chills” every time he heard it. The reference to the Malvinas was “specially moving”, he said, explaining that it is an ode to the Argentinian soldiers who fought against British forces in 1982 in what is commonly referred to as the Falklands war – the name the United Kingdom gave the islands located some 480km (300 miles) off the southern tip of South America. .“The memories are still fresh for many people back home. Those who died are like heroes we can never forget,” said Juan, a 46-year-old from Buenos Aires who now lives in New York. .Football writer Karan Tejwani believes Argentina’s Muchachos anthem is “the song of the World Cup” – and not just for Spanish speakers. .“I don’t speak Spanish, neither do many people I know, but we know the words. That’s how popular it’s become,” the UK-based sports writer told Al Jazeera. “I think of it as one of my favourite chants.” .Tejwani, author Glorious Reinvention: The Rebirth of Ajax Amsterdam, said the lyrics also encapsulate the ups and downs of Messi’s international career. .“It mentions how the fans grew to love him and it seems as though after years of criticism, they finally hold him in the same regard as Maradona,” he said. “For Argentina, this World Cup, the context and the Messi factor, the song is brilliant and it goes beyond just football.” .The World Cup in Qatar is Messi’s last and the final shot at global supremacy, lifting the trophy that has eluded him during his illustrious career. The Albiceleste last won the World Cup in 1986, when Maradona led the team to victory. .Argentina play reigning champions France in the World Cup final on Sunday and the sound of thousands of Argentinian fans signing Muchachos is certain to reverberate throughout Lusail Stadium. .These are the lyrics to the song in Spanish: .En Argentina nací
Tierra del Diego y Lionel
De los pibes de Malvinas

33,Published On 17 Dec 2022,Croatia beat Morocco to finish third in Qatar World Cup,"Goals by Gvardiol and Orsic give Croatia 2-1 victory over Morocco, who had equalised with Dari at Khalifa International Stadium.",".Croatia have eased past Morocco 2-1 to claim third place in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .A sublime header from Joško Gvardiol in the seventh minute made the 20-year-old Croatia’s youngest-ever goal scorer in the national shirt. .Two minutes later, Achraf Dari equalised with a header of his own, and Saturday’s game looked like it might be a goal-fest for the ages. .But action at Doha’s Khalifa International Stadium settled after 10 frantic opening minutes into an entertaining, if less frenetic, match-up as both teams attempted to end their World Cup journey on a high. .Croatia, the 2018 runners-up, started to dominate possession, with Morocco happy to sit deep and contain. .The winner came in the 42nd minute, when Mislav Orsic lobbed a curling ball over the Morocco keeper Yassine Bounou with power, clipping the inside of the far post to rebound into the opposite side netting. .An absolute peach of a shot that meant that Qatar 2022 was the 11th World Cup in a row that a European team finished third. .“It was a great game, we still can’t measure what happened today. Only after a few days we will realise how big this victory is,” Orsic said after the game. .“It was the most important game of my career and I’d like to dedicate it to my family and all the Croatian fans.” .Morocco coach Walid Regragui said he was “a bit disappointed” with a second consecutive defeat but that “they did everything”. .“Our players got very tired. We’re going to learn a lot from this World Cup and we know we’ll need to come back even stronger,” he said. .The last time these two sides faced each other, in the group stage just three weeks ago, the result was a goalless draw. Now, with nothing left to lose, both teams put in a spirited performance for a game that was little like their nervy last encounter. .In an action-packed opening period, Bounou came dangerously close to passing the ball into his own net in the first few seconds of the game. Then Croatia surged in front from a well-rehearsed free kick, as Ivan Perisic nodded Lovro Majer’s clip into the box back towards a diving Gvardiol, who planted his header into the corner. .But Morocco hit back when Hakim Ziyech’s free kick looped up off the head of Majer, allowing Dari to head past Dominik Livakovic in the Croatian goal. .Andrej Kramaric went on to head straight at Bounou, who did well to scoop the ball to safety as Marko Livaja closed in. .Orsic curled in brilliantly via the post from the corner of the box to put Croatia back on top before half-time after 18-year-old Morocco debutant Bilal El Khannouss lost the ball deep in his half. .Orsic again went close moments after the restart, his goal-bound effort brushing Jawad El Yamiq and fizzing narrowly past the post. .Croatia were furious when Gvardiol tumbled inside the area after his foot appeared to be caught by Sofyan Amrabat, but there was no VAR review. .It could have proved a match-changing moment when, moments later, Youssef En Nesyri found a way past Livakovic, who spread himself superbly to block the striker from close range. .Mateo Kovacic went wide with the chance to put the game beyond doubt. Morocco had a late penalty appeal turned down and En Nesyri headed just over in the dying seconds, but the Atlas Lions could not find a way to end their historic run with a victory. .All eyes now turn to Sunday’s final at Lusail Stadium, where holders France will take on Argentina at 13:00 GMT.",33

Moroccans think otherwise,"Both sides will go home without the trophy, but finishing third in World Cup 2022 will mean a lot for Moroccans.",".Doha, Qatar – It is the first of the three Ms in action on the penultimate day of World Cup 2022, the one that the world, football fans and those plotting the moves up there least expected to still be among the call-outs. .Messi and Mbappe can wait. Morocco will be taking centre stage on Saturday, hoping to finish the fairytale run in Qatar with achievements unprecedented. .Morocco will take on Croatia at Khalifa International Stadium in the third-place playoff at Qatar 2022. .Croatia failed to match, or better, their 2018 outing where they lost in the final to France. .Morocco, meanwhile, have reached unprecedented heights, won millions of hearts and gained followers more rapidly than a new pop sensation on Instagram in the historical run to the last four. .For a team that was not used to winning much, especially at a World Cup, the sight of downing Belgium, Canada, Spain and Portugal gave its followers hope. .Since beating Belgium, Morocco hoped for a last-16 slot. Expectations grew when they beat Spain. Fantasy gave way to belief after beating Portugal. For a team that, at first, annoyed their opposition, then alarmed them, had finally left them aghast, gaining as much momentum as rolling down a hill as they eyed the final. .Until they faced France. At Al Bayt Stadium on Wednesday, the dream did not materialise in the way Morocco wanted, perhaps due to the introduction of a new football, the occasion or just the gulf in skills between the two sets of players. .Despite the heartbreak, Morocco fans are hoping for a winning end to their World Cup, one that has already been an extension of a dream of a lifetime. .“Whatever happens now, it’ won’t take away from what they’ve done, they made history,” Omer, visiting Doha from Casablanca for the World Cup, told Al Jazeera. .“It [the World Cup campaign] started with Croatia, it will end with Croatia. I hope we beat them this time [the group stage match ended 0-0]. I hope we finish well. But whatever happens, we’re super proud of the team; we’re fully behind them and we’re supporting them.” .A French masterclass on the pitch ensured the Atlas Lions will not finish higher than third in the World Cup. But they can take third, a final position that was unthinkable by most at the start of the tournament for the 22nd-ranked side. .“Winning matters. The team didn’t make it to the final but it won’t give up,” Amine, also visiting Qatar from Morocco, said. “The team’s performance has changed mindsets everywhere. There’s a winning mentality now and it’s refreshing to see that. A win on Saturday will make a massive difference back home.” .For Imane, a Moroccan living in Paris, a win on Saturday “holds a lot of meaning”. .“It might not seem like much, but getting third place is actually important for us and it holds a lot of meaning because it shows that Morocco’s journey at the World Cup, as historical as it was, was not just luck but the result of the players’ effort and the supporters’ faith,” she said. .“It does matter to me,” Ilham, a Moroccan citizen residing in Qatar, said. “I want to see them win third place. They deserve it. They’ve made us so happy and I want them to be happy.” .For some, the loss against France failed to take the gloss off Morocco’s run to the last four where they became the first team from Africa to reach the semifinals of the World Cup. .“This is football, that’s how it works,” Fatima, a Moroccan supporter, said after the 2-0 loss on Wednesday. “But we’re really proud of the team. Moroccan football has totally changed now. This is not a loss, no way. We are the champions.” .Yasmina, a Qatar resident from Morocco, thinks winning third place would be “amazing and honourable”. .“We’ve already won a lot during this World Cup: pride, unity, solidarity and momentum,” she said. .“But I think the pressure is less and the stress is way smaller on Saturday. I’d love Morocco to beat Croatia but no matter what happens they are my champions.” .With the amount of football, competitions and other happenings in life, most tend to forget the losing finalists of a World Cup let alone the team that finishes third. Losing a semifinal is shattering enough but to park away the memories and prepare for one more match, which will not allow you to relive your dreams, can be demanding for the mind and the body. .For Moroccan fans though, a win on Saturday will be the year-end bonus that nobody had asked their bosses for.",34
35,Published On 17 Dec 2022,Why do we even have a third-place playoff at the World Cup?,"Teams are heartbroken, fans are beyond caring – and it doesn’t even make anyone that much money.",".It’s the game that no one wants to play in, it’s the game few may even want to watch. .The World Cup third-place playoff is settling for second best. Well, third best. .These are teams who have gone all-out, who have trained for years to get to this tournament. These are players who touched down in Qatar with dreams. Not one of the squad members across the 32 teams in Qatar took the field just to show their face. They came to win, to be the best in the world. .Playing for third? Why bother? The dream is over, the trophy is beyond reach. .So, why do we even have a third-place playoff at the World Cup? . .“Typically, the third-place playoff provides a mere footnote, or at best some symmetry to decide the better of the two semifinalists vanquished by the last two remaining teams left in the tournament, upon whom the eyes of the world will be as they compete to be crowned world champions,” David Webber, a researcher into the cultural and political economy of football at Solent University, told Al Jazeera. .“But [it] does, however, serve a sporting purpose. At the very least, a shot at redemption, and an opportunity to celebrate the achievement of reaching the last four of the competition. Rarely are these games short on entertainment either, with four out of the last seven bronze medal games, since 1994, seeing four goals or more. With nothing to lose, teams will often go on the attack – with strikers after the Golden Boot often the main beneficiaries.” .This “bronze medal” idea plays into a wider sense of sporting history. .“The origin of the World Cup was very much influenced by the Olympics, and the ideology there was always gold, silver and bronze,” said Paul Widdop, a sport business academic at the University of Manchester. “This is then reflected in the way the World Cup is organised. It’s similar to why we have a four-year World Cup cycle, based on outdated Greek mythology.” . .FIFA makes money from ticket sales. An extra match means at least 45,000 more people in Khalifa International Stadium, each paying between $80 (for Qatari residents) and $425. That’s a fair chunk of change. Qatar 2022 helped boost FIFA’s income by more than $1bn to over $7bn for this four-year cycle. .There must also be little appeal for sponsors, who would sooner be associated with the showpiece final rather than a game that for many fans and players offers little consolation. .As an example of just one TV market, in 2018, about 9.8 million United Kingdom viewers tuned in to watch England lose the third-place playoff to Belgium, Widdop noted. More than 26.5 million – 40 percent of the UK’s population – had watched England’s previous game: the semifinal defeat at the hands of Croatia. And that’s just people who watched at home. .Whether it’s about squeezing the last few riyals out of the tournament or stretching the last sinew of competition – to finish third is better than finishing fourth, after all. The match is a chance to celebrate those who came so close to football’s greatest glory. .FIFA President Gianni Infantino called Qatar 2022 the “best World Cup ever”. And this year, with the fairytale run of Morocco, and the likely departure from the international stage of Croatia’s heroic Luka Modric, with the devastation of semifinal defeat still raw, there’s one more chance to go home on a high.",35
36,Published On 17 Dec 2022,Morocco World Cup success boosts academy that gave players start,Morocco’s national academy has produced numerous players who have starred in their historic run to the semifinals.,".At a football academy near Rabat, 100 young Moroccans hope to emulate the success of alumni who took the national team to a World Cup semifinal and will play in a third-place game on Saturday. .Morocco spent $13m to build Mohammed VI Football Academy in 2010 when the kingdom’s scene in the sport was in the doldrums, lagging behind African counterparts after having failed to reach the World Cup since 1998. .While many of the triumphant Atlas Lions squad grew up abroad, four of those who were born in Morocco trained as youngsters at the nation’s principal academy, which brings in talent from across the country. .“The World Cup participation of players who graduated from the academy, and their run to reach the semifinals for the first time in the history of Arabs and Africa, gives a sense of pride and honour to all technical, medical and administrative staff,” said the academy’s Tarik El Khazri who coached Youssef En Nesyri, scorer of Morocco’s winning goal in their quarterfinal defeat of Spain. .The three other national team players who studied and trained at the academy are Azzedine Ounahi, Nayef Aguerd and Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti. .The academy stretches over 17 hectares (42 acres) and has its own boarding house, restaurant, clinic, entertainment hall, swimming pool and classrooms, as well as nine pitches, including a covered one. .The curriculum combines training on the pitch with classroom sessions. Most students leave the academy with a bachelor’s degree. .Some 90 percent of graduates get to continue elsewhere as football players, said another coach Belmahdi Abdellatif, and most big Moroccan teams comprise players who started out at the academy. .Others went on to play in Europe. .Meanwhile, Moroccan football is on the up, with its clubs winning all three pan-African tournaments this year. .Khazri said the academy is “flooded with applications” after the Moroccan national team’s run at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.",36
37,Published On 17 Dec 2022,"Playing seven games at one World Cup is priceless, says Regragui",Morocco have had an historic campaign at this year’s World Cup and are hoping for one last hurrah in the 3rd-place game.,".Morocco may not have reached the World Cup final but players and supporters can take pride in the fact that they played seven games in Qatar, a first for any African nation, coach Walid Regragui said on Friday. .The North Africans’ dream run at the World Cup ended after defeat by reigning champions France in the semifinals but they still have the opportunity to leave Qatar on a high when they take on Croatia in the third-place playoff on Saturday. .Regragui said he would not make too many changes to the squad as that would upset the team balance but admitted it was a difficult and complicated game for two teams being asked to play after the disappointment of losing semifinal matches. .“I understand it’s important to finish third rather than fourth, but my takeaway is we didn’t reach the final … We wanted to play the final on Sunday, not play tomorrow,” Regragui said. .“But I told my players this is our seventh World Cup game. If you told any Morocco fan we would be playing our seventh game on December 17, they would be proud. .“Morocco played six World Cup games in 20-odd years and now we’ve played six games in a month – this is priceless. It’s as if we played two World Cups or even more, that’s beautiful from an experience point of view.” .Regragui said Croatia were a formidable team even if they had not been favoured to repeat their 2018 run, when they finished runners-up in Russia. Their dreams were crushed by Lionel Messi’s Argentina in the semifinal. .“We knew Croatia were going to be one of the best teams in the competition. After the first game (where Morocco and Croatia drew 0-0 in the group stage) we knew the performance was very good,” Regragui said. .“There was a lot of hesitation for the first game … Both teams will want to win it (on Saturday) and it will be a great game.” .The game could be Croatian midfielder Luka Modric’s last with the national team and Regragui praised the Real Madrid man who is still going strong at 37. .“I don’t know if it’s Modric’s last game, he’s a competitive warrior and will want to finish his World Cup in style,” Regragui said. “Hats off to Modric. What he’s doing at 37 is monumental. He was a Ballon d’Or winner and I completely understand why.”",37

The most unpredictable team at the World Cup made history by becoming the first Arab and African country to reach the last four. The Croatians, led by Luka Modric, were beaten 3-0 by Argentina in the first semifinal. .The two sides have faced each other on two occasions with both matches ending in a draw after 90 minutes. Croatia went on to win on penalties. .Kashef slightly favours 12th-ranked Croatia for the win today, giving the team a 56 percent chance of beating 22nd-ranked Morocco. . . .With 62 matches completed, Kashef has a 68 percent accuracy level. Sizing up all the odds, it could not be any closer with only one percent separating Argentina and France from winning a third title. .However, only one team can emerge victorious. Kashef predicts that France, captained by Hugo Lloris, will edge out Argentina on Sunday to win the 2022 World Cup. .Predicting match results is no easy task.

39,Published On 17 Dec 2022,Croatia vs Morocco playoff preview: World Cup 2022,"Neither team wanted to play this match but now that they are here, they have nothing to lose.",".It is the end of the road for Croatia and Morocco at this World Cup. Regardless of the result, both sides will be heading home without the trophy. .But as this World Cup – which has brought so many shocks, so much drama and seen so many dreams being shattered as well as coming true – draws to a close, these two teams have a unique opportunity for their swan song: to say farewell to Qatar with heads held high and reflect on what has been done and what may be to come. .It seems like a lifetime since their last meeting, a nervy 0-0 draw in their opening Group F game, just three weeks ago. What that match lacked in goals, it made up for in intensity, as both teams wrestled for dominance. But we are unlikely to see those same nerves on Saturday, with neither Croatia nor Morocco having anything to lose now. . .For Croatia, it is likely a goodbye for midfield general Luka Modric. The 37-year-old captain has been instrumental in Croatia’s resurgence as a footballing power over the past 15 years. He was part of the squad for the European Championships of 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020, and appeared at World Cups in 2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022. .It is a phrase that gets used too often but it will be the end of an era when Modric retires from international football. .For Morocco, it is a moment to receive adulation and thanks from a world that dared for a few weeks to believe in the impossible – and for the team to show us once again what they are capable of in the next international cycle. .The Atlas Lions may have been regarded by many as underdogs but you do not get to a World Cup semifinal with just luck. They earned their success through guile, hard work and talent. Their story, their unlikely tale of winning against the odds – again and again – is why we all love this game. .“Having already completed a hat-trick of World Cup firsts for Africa, history once again beckons for Morocco and Walid Regragui’s men,” David Webber, a researcher into the cultural and political economy of football at Solent University, told Al Jazeera. .“Perhaps Morocco’s performance at this World Cup will be enough to persuade FIFA delegates to finally award the tournament itself to Morocco after several failed bids in the past. .“Irrespective of Saturday’s result, the Moroccans will bring the noise and the passion that they have throughout the tournament and, in so doing, celebrate a team that has given the nation and North African region the most memorable month of its rich footballing history.” .Morocco may have been the story of this World Cup but Croatia are no less deserving. This game is about pride. To paraphrase James Goldman’s The Lion In Winter, “when the fall is all that’s left, it matters”. .Croatia punches above its weight like no other European footballing power. This is a country of fewer than four million people. They were only recognised by FIFA in 1992 and yet ended their first-ever World Cup campaign with a third-place finish just six years later. .Modric now has the chance to depart the international stage with the final flourish his incredible career deserves, notes Webber. .  .“This World Cup has been about ‘the last dance’ for so many of Modric’s contemporaries,” he said. .“And while all eyes will be on Messi on Sunday evening to see whether he can finally lead Argentina to World Cup glory, Saturday’s match against Morocco affords Croatia’s own number 10 the opportunity to bow out with a victory rather than the pain of a semifinal defeat.” .No one wants to be playing this game. But now they are here, the dreamers of Morocco and the warriors of Croatia will be giving it their all. .History is there to be made and the only thing at stake is immortality.",39
40,Published On 16 Dec 2022,World Cup mural gig helps Doha artist turn hobby into lifeline,Filipino painter Michael Conjusta was hired by Qatari authorities to paint graffiti murals during the 2022 World Cup.,".Doha, Qatar – Michael Conjusta, a Doha-based freelance artist was going about his day one August afternoon when he received an unexpected WhatsApp message with an offer to paint graffiti murals at football stadiums during the FIFA 2022 World Cup. .The message had come from a member of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), the official tournament organisers. .Stunned, Conjusta replied excitedly, “Yes! Of course.” .The recommendation for the task, he soon found out, had come from Qatar’s Ministry Of Culture, Arts And Heritage. .“It made me so happy [that] the ministry of people acknowledged my work,” the 44-year-old interior decorator and painter from the Philippines told Al Jazeera. “I mean, there are all these artists here in Doha … good artists of different nationalities. But I was one of the few people they chose … it’s a big pleasure for me.” .Conjusta, who has been living in Doha since 1998, had initially thought of volunteering for the tournament before it began but figured the stress would be a “big headache” to add to his continuing work commitments. .However, when the offer from the Supreme Committee came, it was an opportunity he “simply could not decline”. .Conjusta’s work has been one of the many side attractions integrated into the Qatar 2022 World Cup, which is drawing to a close. The tournament, the first edition to be held in the Middle East, has provided many colourful surprises on and off the pitch. .For the tournament, Conjusta has been tasked with painting murals at most games held at Al Bayt and Lusail stadiums, the two largest venues hosting matches at the World Cup. .Working near the entrance gates, the artist makes his murals on canvas using acrylic paint. .The murals are typically a sketch of teams playing on the day, usually with a national flag or a unique cultural marker such as a national animal. .To keep things fresh, the Filipino artist tries to pay homage to the tournament by thinking up new ideas for different games. In one instance, he drew an illustration of the World Cup mascot Laeeb. .Conjusta’s work can also be found along the Corniche – a waterfront promenade and major tourist spot in central Doha to which he was assigned on non-match days. .The tasks have so far been time-sensitive, with the artist having to complete murals in three to four hours. This gruelling schedule has left Conjusta with no time or energy, he said, to be at any of the games happening only a few hundred metres away from where he works, to watch the magic of the likes of Argentina’s Lionel Messi and French ace Kylian Mbappe. .“After people go inside the stadium, I prepare to go home and rest … and avoid the rush at the metro,” Conjusta, who lives in the Abu Hamour neighbourhood of Doha, said. .Nevertheless, the past month has been “really worth it”, he said, as “lots of spectators took my number, including many local Qataris for future projects”. .“People will pass by while I’m working and want to take pictures, tagging me on Instagram and writing really kind things,” he added. .Supporting his family .Aside from being a notable achievement on his resume, the World Cup project has supplemented Conjusta’s income. .His move to Qatar more than 23 years ago after being forced to drop out of architecture school, had been primarily to help support his family of seven back in the Philippines. .“Acrylic painting on canvasses was just a hobby, a passion. But now I’m earning for that hobby … it helps me get extra money to provide for my family,” Conjusta, the youngest of six siblings, said. .“Three of them [siblings] are diabetic with one on insulin … which costs more than 1000 riyals ($275) a month. My father passed away when I was two, so I support my mother, too.” .Since then, the Filipino artist has worked numerous jobs including decorating homes, malls and government properties, and now thinks of Doha as his second home. .“For the longest time I was not sure where my life was going … but when I look back at what I have achieved in the past 24 years till today, it has been an amazing journey,” he said. .“I’m one of those dreamers,” Conjusta said, comparing his life to the World Cup soundtrack “Dreamers” by Jungkook, a member of the K-pop band BTS. “I make it happen, because I believe … through my passion, I can do anything.”",40
41,Published On 16 Dec 2022,"Why Indians love World Cup football, even without India in it","In a country that has never played at the World Cup, passion for the sport comes alive during the event.",".It is a routine that plays out every four years. Indian football fans get louder and more rambunctious as the World Cup draws nearer, even though India is not part of the tournament. .During every World Cup, huge posters of football icons like Argentina’s Lionel Messi, and Brazil’s Neymar, sometimes even adorned with garlands, can be found along roads in the subcontinent’s football-crazy states and regions like Kerala, West Bengal, Goa and the country’s northeast, where fans are for the most part fiercely loyal to Brazil and Argentina. .Flags from countries participating in the World Cup, football-themed menus in eateries, and shops selling World Cup souvenirs are also common in these places during football’s biggest event. .“We may not have shown our merit in football yet, but if there was a World Cup for ‘Fanball’ we would be in the running…,” Indian business tycoon Anand Mahindra said in a tweet after fans in Kerala, clad in football jerseys of their favourite players, celebrated Argentina’s berth into World Cup final by leading a parade through the streets. . .Elsewhere in India, such as in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai and New Delhi, cafés and bars have also opened their doors to football fans, with some of them showing matches into the night. .For Saihlupuii Sailo, a teacher based in Aizawl, the capital of the northeast Indian state of Mizoram, watching the World Cup was also a family affair. .“Football is a sport that my entire family loves. I grew up watching football and the first World Cup I watched was in 1990. I don’t really remember much about the game but I remember my parents adjusting the television antenna for us to get better signal,” Sailo, who watched the semifinals along with her brother Sailo Vanlalthlana Jr and her nephew Lalchhanhima, told Al Jazeera. .“It brings back a lot of memories,” she said. And a predicament. Her family supported Argentina, while she liked the French side more. But before Sunday’s final between those two teams, she might switch her loyalties for once. “I want Messi to win, I feel no one deserves it more than him.” .While Sailo and her family have watched matches on television, thousands of Indian fans have travelled to Qatar to watch the World Cup live. According to FIFA, Indian fans made up the second-largest number of people watching the games in Qatar during the group stage, after Saudi Arabia. . .Among them was Chelston Pinto, a professional football player from Bengaluru and the co-founder of Rapid Sport Fitness, a gym for elite athletes. He thought the beauty and simplicity of playing football made it a game people in India love watching. .“Watching the games in Qatar was definitely an experience of a lifetime,” he said. “Each fan base brings in something different, and I think the whole fan environment created in Qatar was a brilliant experience. It’s something that I would recommend to every Indian fan.” .Recently, India has struggled to come even close to qualifying for the FIFA World Cup. But back in 1950, the country had what has since been described as a golden generation of players. At the 1948 London Olympics, India had fought hard against a fancied French team before losing 2-1. .In advance of the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, India was placed in a qualifying group with the Philippines and Burma (now Myanmar). But both those other sides withdrew from the competition at a time when the tournament was still in its infancy, Asian countries were comparatively poorer, and the prospect of a trip across the world to South America was expensive. As a result, India qualified for the World Cup by default. .But India, too, decided against sending a team to Brazil. The country’s football federation has never explained the decision and theories are plentiful: Some have said it is because the team wanted to play barefoot, while others claimed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) could not afford to send the players to Brazil at the time. .Whatever the reason, it was an opportunity missed — one that India has never had since.  India next participated in the World Cup qualifiers only in 1986. .The Indian team still has a long way to go in order to qualify for the World Cup, Pinto said. .“I think we first need to start from the grassroots and hold a lot more tournaments within India. Professional footballers are only playing for about four to six months, which is definitely not enough,” he said. Instead, they need access to top-notch training facilities and tough competition for at least 10 months of the year, he said. .The country also needs a footballing calendar from the grassroots level, Pinto said, with a focus on training young players with talent from the under-12 age group. “Those are the players who would get India into the World Cup in the future,” he said. .The AIFF has a new leadership that took over in September. The Indian Super League – India’s top professional football league starting the 2022-23 season – has had increasing television viewership and fan support since its launch in 2013. Pinto hopes these changes will pave the way for India to qualify for the World Cup in the future. .Still, even without India’s participation in the World Cup, support for the sport in the country remains high: Top European clubs count India as an increasing market of fans. .This passion for global football first soared when Brazil’s Pelé and Argentina’s Diego Maradona reigned on the pitch, said fans. “My dad has been supporting these countries for many years because of these players who were like India’s football gods back then,” Mumbai-based Praman Narain, founder of a travel lodging startup called Roamhome, told Al Jazeera. “He loved watching them play and I think these individual players might be one of the reasons Indians love watching the game.” .Today, Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentina’s Messi receive similar love. “Maybe in the future, if India qualifies, an Indian player might get such treatment,” Narain said. .Adhip Chopra, a Mumbai-based freelance filmmaker working with Indian production company Yash Raj Films, drew parallels between the football on display at the Qatar World Cup, where unfancied teams have upset multiple top contenders, and the Bollywood scripts that Indians love. .“It’s been an entertaining World Cup for sure,” Chopra told Al Jazeera. “I would have scripted games where Japan, Spain and Germany played in the group stages. The thrill of the games had all the melodrama, action and entertainment which Indians enjoy in Bollywood movies.” Japan defeated Germany and Spain, both former champions, in the group stage of the World Cup. .For many Indian fans, the rise of Asian teams, such as Japan and South Korea, and African teams, such as Morocco, have also been a welcome surprise. .Aiman Fayaz, 20, pursuing her Bachelor’s degree in English literature and based in Srinagar, in Indian-administered Kashmir, has typically been a Portugal supporter. But Morocco’s performance this year has meant a lot to Kashmiris, she said. .“They are not only playing for Africa. They are playing for every Muslim nation, you know,” she said. “They have been supporting Palestine in their cheer slogans and it feels amazing to know that teams like Morocco are supporting places which are in conflict. Being a Kashmiri, it really feels nice to see this.” .Football is popular among girls in Kashmir, she said. “There is a lot of fighting going on in our region, but with how Morocco played and how they’re supporting Palestine, there is hope for us in Kashmir,” she said. “I also hope that if India ever makes it into the World Cup, we have Kashmiri players in the team.” .Anshuk Megharikh, a corporate lawyer based in Bengaluru, said Morocco’s underdog status was also a key reason why the country’s team was finding support in India. “Everyone loves to see an underdog play well,” he told Al Jazeera. “A majority of the people in India, no matter who they claim to support, are also neutral fans. So for a neutral fan like myself, to be able to see the amazing games that Morocco have played, is inspiring.” .“That’s the kind of story that comes around once every four years. And that’s the story that really overshadows everything else about this tournament,” he added",41
42,Published On 15 Dec 2022,Julius Hirsch: The German ‘national hero’ killed by the Nazis,"Only the second Jew to play for Germany, Hirsch broke records and fought in WWI for a country that would later kill him.",".Julius Hirsch never visited the United Kingdom, but the German footballer’s memory lives on in a corner of southwest London. .On the outside wall of Chelsea’s famous stadium Stamford Bridge, surrounded by towering images of some of the club’s legendary captains lifting silverware, is a colourful 12-foot mural of Hirsch and two others – the Hungarian winger Arpad Weisz and the Englishman Ron Jones, who was known as the “Goalkeeper of Auschwitz”. .Jones survived the notorious German concentration camp, but both Hirsch and Weisz are believed to have been killed there during the Holocaust. The unveiling of the mural in January 2020 as a part of Chelsea’s “Say no to antisemitism” campaign marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. .“By sharing the images of these three individual football players on our stadium, we hope to inspire future generations to always fight against antisemitism, discrimination and racism,” Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck said at the time. .Yet while Hirsch is today remembered in Germany and beyond as a pathbreaking and brave athlete, his story is also a reminder of a dark chapter in the history of one of the world’s most successful football nations. .Hirsch led a pioneering, turbulent and ultimately tragic life as the second-ever Jewish person to play international football for Germany. He was a decorated soldier who fought in World War I before being murdered by his own country. .Born in the village of Achern in southwest Germany in April 1892, Hirsch was the youngest of seven children born to Emma and Berthold, a Jewish merchant who had fought in the Franco-Prussian war that united modern Germany. The family moved to Karlsruhe when Hirsch was seven years old. Three years later, after showing a talent for football, he joined the local team Karlsruher FV, which had been founded by a Jewish businessman. .At the age of 17 in 1909, he made his debut for the first team and was soon recognised for his impressive left foot, powerful shot and prolific goal-scoring. .He played for an English manager, the former Blackburn Rovers and England player William Townley and would form a part of a famous attacking triumvirate with Gottfried Fuchs and Fritz Forderer, who inspired Karlsruher FV to the German championship in 1910. .The following year Hirsch became the second-ever Jew to play for Germany after Fuchs, when he faced Hungary in December 1911, aged only 18 years old. He then represented his country at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. .Hirsch became the first German to score four international goals in a game in a 5-5 draw with the Netherlands in Zwolle in March 1912. His club teammate Fuchs would spectacularly overtake his record by scoring 10 goals against Russia in July 1912. .Hirsch played as an amateur and worked for his family textile business, because of which he had to move to the small city of Furth in Bavaria where he signed up to play for SpVgg Greuther Furth. In his very first season in 1914, he helped them win the German championship to become the first player ever to win it with two different teams. .When World War I broke out, Hirsch enlisted in the army with the Royal Bavarian Landwehr Infantry Regiment and was awarded the Iron Cross in 1919 for his courage and gallantry. His brother Leopold died during the Battle of Kemmel Ridge in Belgium in April 1918. Two other brothers, Max and Rudolf, also fought in the war, and were awarded the Iron Cross. .After the war, Hirsch returned to play for Karlsruher FV for another six years before he retired in 1925. He continued to help at the club as a committee member and youth coach. In 1920, he married Ellen Karolina Hauser, a Christian. They had two children, a son Heinold and a daughter Esther. .But in 1933, Adolf Hitler was elected German chancellor. Within months, football clubs across the country responded by purging their Jewish members. .On April 10 that year, Hirsch tendered his resignation to Karlsruher FV, a club he had been a member of for more than three decades, to be spared the indignity of being forced out. .“I read in the Stuttgart Sports Report that the biggest clubs including the KFV made the decision to remove Jews from their organisations,” he wrote to them. “I have been a member since 1902, and at that time I loyally and honestly dedicated my weak abilities to the club…. I would like to say that in this brutal German nation, so hated around the world, there are decent patriotic people including German Jews who have demonstrated their good faith through their actions and their bloodshed.” .Under Nazi rule, his family business went bankrupt, and he became increasingly fearful and isolated, suffering a nervous breakdown. .As the Nazis began to burn down synagogues and openly attack Jewish shops and people, Hirsch’s marriage to a Christian — and their children of mixed heritage — offered him little immunity. In 1939, he was placed into forced labour by the municipal works service at a dump in Karlsruhe. .In December 1942, in an effort to protect his family, Hirsch divorced his wife to allow her and their children, who had been banished from school, to use her maiden name and hide their background. Yet this also removed whatever little chance he had of avoiding the deportations that had seen Jews disappear. .On March 1, 1943, he reported to Karlsruhe train station to be transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp for what the Nazis called “employment of labour in the East”. .His daughter Esther accompanied him to the station. “It is one of my worst memories,” she wrote afterwards. “It was a lovely day; to this day I don’t understand how the sun could have been shining. We didn’t believe that we would never see him again. .“That night, we, mother, my brother and I, all woke up simultaneously. At the same moment, we all thought: something has happened. My father never thought that the Germans would be able to do something to him. He couldn’t imagine that they would do something to a soldier at the front and a footballer in the national team. He was connected to Germany, he was pro-Germany, as was his brother.” .“It was so humiliating for him to perform forced labour in Karlsruhe. He was a good man, always so understanding. I loved him very much, and I’m still grateful to him for his affection.” .Two days later, Hirsch sent a letter to Esther for her 15th birthday, believed to be from a stop at Dortmund en route to Auschwitz. He wrote: “My darling, I am very well, and I arrived safely. I will [eventually] reach Upper Silesia, [and will] still [be] in Germany. Greetings and kisses, Juler [Julius].” .This was the last the family ever heard from Hirsch, who is believed to have died in Auschwitz, although there was no record of him having reached the camp. It is thought he might have been gassed as soon as his train arrived without being officially registered. In January 1950, a German court declared him dead and set his date of death as May 8, 1945, when he would have been 53 years old. .In February 1945, his two children — defined by the Nazis as “Mischling”, a pejorative term used by them to describe people who were of a mixed race or not fully “Aryan” — were deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is today the Czech Republic. They survived until the camp was liberated by the Soviet Red Army in May of that year. His wife Ellen also survived and after the war changed her name back to Hirsch. .Hirsch’s former teammate Fuchs avoided the fate of his one-time goal-scoring ally by escaping to Switzerland and France before settling in Canada, where he died at the age of 82 in 1972. .Forderer, their other teammate who was not Jewish, followed a very different path. He joined the Nazi party in 1942 and would go on to coach various football teams, including one comprised of members of the Third SS Death-Head unit that ran the Buchenwald concentration camp and who were responsible for the deaths of 56,000 people. .By then, Hirsh had already been airbrushed out of history. In 1939, when the German football magazine Kicker produced an edition listing all the players who had ever played for the national team, Hirsh and Fuchs — with 13 games and 17 goals between them — were not mentioned. .It was not until the 1990s that their achievements began to earn greater recognition. In 1998, the sport hall at Ludwig-Marum school in Pfinztal-Berghausen was named after Hirsch, and in 2014, Karlsruhe city council named a street after Hirsch and a square after Fuchs in the shadow of the stadium where they had played together more than a century earlier. .In 2005, the German Football Federation (DFB) launched the Julius Hirsch Prize, which is awarded each year to an individual, club or campaign that shows a commitment to democracy and human dignity, and opposition to anti-Semitism and racism. Hirsch’s grandson Andreas Hirsch sits on the jury for the award. .“Julius Hirsch had been a national hero, but from one day to the next, was treated like an insect,” Theo Zwanziger, the then-president of the DFB, said in 2005. “We want to come to terms with our past and not just brush over all of this.” .Over at Stamford Bridge, it is clear that Hirsch is no longer remembered just as a “national hero”. A genocidal regime killed him 77 years ago. It could not kill his legacy.",42
43,Published On 15 Dec 2022,Morocco was the World Cup feel-good story we needed,Scenes of players frolicking on the pitch with their mothers were more than enough for me.," .As I sat with my family watching the first half of France vs Morocco, a chant from Moroccan fans rumbled through the stadium. .“Are they saying ‘La ilaha il Allah’?” I asked my husband. .“No way – but it sure sounds like it.” .They were, in fact, repeating the first half of the Muslim declaration of faith, “There is no God but God,” and a few claps later, the second half: “Muhammad is the messenger of God.” A sort of collective rallying cry to both uplift spirits and express pride in Islam’s central creed among fellow believers. .Our scepticism clearly had not caught up with the mesmerising spectacle that was the Atlas Lions. .It was the winning streak that at least in this region, we could not look away from – the deeply satisfying underdog narrative of this World Cup, most deliciously for Arabs, Africans, the diaspora in the West, and Muslims collectively, rejoicing at an authentic representation of their lived faith and values on display in the most celebratory way. .When some of the players showed the world just how much they love their mothers, many Muslims joked that it was only due to the “mother’s ‘dua’ [prayer]” that they were still hanging on. .Others commented that their against-all-odds victories – against Belgium, Spain, Portugal – were a case of feeling more at home at the first World Cup in the Middle East, being in their neck of the woods (or the closest thing to it), and the energy of the fans, that propelled them to keep on keeping on. .No one could deny the electrifying Moroccan fandom that to an outsider seemed to pop up in Qatar overnight. And that is the thing about this story in particular – it was as much about the fans as it was about the players. .When Morocco beat Portugal last week, a colleague turned to me and asked an important editorial question: “So, the first African team to make it to the semis, or the first Arab team?” .My answer did not skip a beat. .“Both. All of it. And then some. Their win means whatever you want it to mean, for you.” .We decided right there and then that our coverage would not delve into the very real identity ping-pong taking place over who gets to claim Morocco. .It is not that these debates are not valid; it is that we simply chose to lean into a moment swirling in optimism and unity. .We also chose a different conversation to spotlight: the power of football as a force for social change. .I spoke to a few people who were merely supporting Morocco in solidarity with the Palestinian cause, as players and fans regularly waved the Palestinian flag. For them, the following message about Palestinians was enough: “They exist. Their struggle is real and felt beyond their homes. They will not be erased.” .It is so much bigger than football. .And the ability of the Atlas Lions to connect so many people from different backgrounds around a common desire to believe in miracles, shift the game when no one saw it coming, in a region ignored by football’s big guns (until now) – was a story worth telling, and one the world needed, however fleeting.",43
44,Published On 15 Dec 2022,Mbappe tells Hakimi: ‘You made history’ at the World Cup,"After France dashed Morocco’s hopes in Wednesday’s semifinal, the friends swapped shirts, hugs and respect.",".As the final whistle blew on Wednesday night in Al Khor, Moroccan players dropped to the ground in a culmination of disappointment and physical exhaustion. France had beaten them 2-0, but the Atlas Lions – the tournament’s giant killers – had gone toe to toe with the current champions throughout. .Amid the wild celebrations from the French players, their superstar forward, Kylian Mbappe, could be seen weaving his way around his teammates before leaning over his good friend and stalwart of the Moroccan defence, Achraf Hakimi. He helped the full-back to his feet before the two men shared a warm embrace. .The heartwarming moment reflects the sincere and public respect the two friends showed each other during Morocco’s first-ever World Cup semifinal appearance last night. .Before the match, the two were visibly pleased to see each other shaking hands and hugging in the tunnel, and during the game, they were seen sharing a joke. And barely a couple of hours after the match, Mbappe made his respect for his friend and the Moroccan side public. .“Don’t be sad bro, everybody is proud of what you did, you made history,” the French star posted on Twitter, with an image of the friends embracing. . .It is a longstanding friendship that has blossomed since Hakimi transferred to Paris Saint-Germain – where Mbappe also plays – in 2021. They are often seen socialising with each other outside of football, including a joint holiday in Spain. .Hakimi has earlier defended Mbappe when the prospect of him leaving PSG was brought up. “It’s a pleasure to have him by my side. He is one of the best players in the world, but above all, he is my friend. I love him,” Hakimi had told Telefoot in April. .The friends had playfully jousted with each other over social media in January this year when the prospect of facing each other at the World Cup was raised. .“I have to destroy my friend,” Mbappe joked in a short video message. “It will break my heart a little bit, but you know, that is football. I have to kill him.” .Hakimi’s response? “I’m going to smash him,” the 24-year-old Moroccan wing-back said with a smile. .But as the distant prospect became a reality, their public messaging became increasingly heartfelt. . .After the game, the two players swapped shirts, with Mbappe wearing Hakimi’s shirt back to front, ensuring his friend’s name was more visible during his celebrations. .In the tunnel, the two were spotted slumped against the wall, chatting together. . .Morocco had reached the semifinal having only conceded one goal and with an unbeaten record. The Atlas Lions are the first Arab or African country to reach the World Cup semifinal stage. .The two players are both expected to play again for their respective countries at the World Cup: Mbappe against Argentina in the final, and Hakimi against Croatia in the tournament’s third-place playoff, before travelling back to Paris.",44

But Modric’s plans are unknown.,".Croatia’s veteran playmaker Luka Modric was “hit really hard” by his team’s defeat to Argentina in Tuesday’s World Cup semifinal, according to the team’s manager Zlatko Dalic. .The 37-year-old Modric made his 161st appearance for his country in the final four match where an inspired Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 to book a spot in Sunday’s final. .That loss leaves Croatia with a third-place playoff against Morocco on Saturday, and it is unclear whether Modric will play any more for the national team after the World Cup. .The 10-time Croatian footballer of the year won the Ballon D’or and the FIFA Golden Ball in 2018 as he captained his national team to the World Cup final – which they lost 4-2 to France. .On Tuesday, Modric was taken off late in the second half to a standing ovation from both Croatian and Argentinian fans. The optics raised questions about whether it was a final goodbye, with the Real Madrid midfielder hugging each of his teammates as he traipsed off the pitch. .Dalic has suggested that he would like the current Croatian side, with Modric at the helm, to remain together until the 2024 European Championships. .“We have had a great team, and this generation will finish off their career at Euro 2024”, Dalic said at a press conference on Tuesday. “We have the Nations League and an excellent generation who reached two semifinals”, he added. .Modric has also enjoyed considerable success at club level, winning La Liga three times and picking up five Champions League trophies during his 11 at Real Madrid. .Dalic said that Modric would make the decision on international retirement “on his own” but added that “surely the whole world would miss him if he retires from the national team, and I hope he won’t decide to do that”. .“Luka Modric showed he is not only a great player, he’s a great professional, a great sportsman,” Dalic said. .Early in the tournament, Modric hinted that he would like to extend his stay at Real Madrid for another season. His current contract is due to expire in the summer due to the club’s policy of only handing annual extensions to players over 30. .“Of course, I want to retire in Madrid; I’ve said that many times,” Modric said. “You can’t say anything for 100 percent, but that’s my idea, and it’s a dream for me.”",45
46,Published On 15 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: Messi a ‘different proposition’ says Griezmann,Greizmann has assured fans that France ‘will be prepared’ as they face an in-form Messi and a well-supported Argentina.,".French playmaker Antoine Griezmann has admitted that facing seven times Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi will present “a totally different proposition” after France overcame a strong Morocco side on Wednesday to reach their second World Cup final in a row. .“We’ve seen practically all of the matches at this World Cup, we’ve seen Argentina play, we know how they play, they are a difficult team to play and a team who are on top form,” the 31-year-old Atlético Madrid star said in a post-match press conference. .Griezmann was the man of the match against Morocco, and his performances at the World Cup have earned him plenty of plaudits. Injuries to Paul Pogba and N’golo Kante before the tournament meant Griezmann, who usually plays as a forward, was forced to drop into midfield – something he has done with aplomb – racking up three vital assists in the knockout stages. .After the semifinal win, however, Griezmann urged his team to not become complacent. La Albiceleste, as Argentina are known, produced a fine team performance on Tuesday as they brushed aside Croatia 3-0 in the semifinal. “They seem to be on top form, there isn’t only Messi – they have a strong side around him,” said Griezmann. .Messi is the leading goalscorer this tournament along with France’s Kylian Mbappe with five goals. His side recovered from a first-round defeat to Saudi Arabia to top their group and then beat Australia, the Netherlands and Croatia in the knockout games. .Throughout the tournament, Argentina have enjoyed significant support in the stands, with many fans making the more than 13,000km (8,080 miles) journey from Argentina to Qatar to urge their side on. .“We know it is going to be a tough game, and they are going to have the support of the crowd,” said Griezmann. .Griezmann assured French fans that they understand the threat of an Argentina side who have grown in confidence as the tournament has progressed and “will be well prepared”. .The two teams played each other at the 2018 World Cup in a thrilling 4-3 win for France. .Recently, the 35-year-old Messi confirmed this would be his last appearance at the World Cup.",46

Fantastic … They played from the heart but also with an undeniable quality. Reaching the semifinals of the World Cup doesn’t happen by chance,” Infantino noted. .He congratulated Morocco, but also Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana and Tunisia. .“This puts on display the level of African football. I am very happy. The moment of African football was always about to arrive. And it finally did. And the fact that, in the next World Cup, the number of African teams participating will almost double will help that.” .There was a nod, too, for the first woman who refereed a match, Stephanie Frappart from France. .“The World Cup has been an incredible success on all fronts,” Infantino added. .“The main one being the fans, the behaviour, the joyful atmosphere, the bringing of people together. The fans meeting the Arab world, it has been very important for the future of all of us.” .The World Cup in Qatar has also helped FIFA generate more than $1bn on top of expectations for this four-year cycle, Infantino told reporters. .FIFA raked in around $7.5bn in the 2018-2022 cycle, and Infantino estimated income upwards of $11bn by the end of the 2026 World Cup, to be held across North America. .Of course, this World Cup is still not over, with the third-place playoff between Croatia and Morocco on Saturday, and, of course, the flagship World Cup final between Argentina and France on Sunday, Qatar’s National Day. .So far, already 3.27 million spectators have attended the games, compared with an overall 3.3 million at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. .There could be changes in the format for the 2026 World Cup, the FIFA chief indicated, with teams increasing from 32 to 48, set to be divided into 16 groups of three, with the top two progressing to the last 32. But this is still to be discussed within FIFA. .The four-team group format, with the top two going through to the knockout rounds, has been used since the World Cup expanded to 32 teams in 1998, and led to some spectacular drama in the closing games of this year’s group stage. .Infantino also said that the 2025 Club World Cup will feature 32 teams, making the format similar to that of the current tournament. .Currently, the top teams of every continental competition, as well as the hosts’ national champion, battle it out for the Club World Cup title. .He said the tournament, which currently involves seven teams, would be held every four years and would boost revenues for the global sports body. .Infantino said that the 2022 Club World Cup, traditionally held in December but delayed this year because of the Qatar event, will be hosted by Morocco from February 1-11 2023.",47

Expectations grew when they beat Spain. Fantasy gave way to belief after beating Portugal. .But on Wednesday at Al Bayt Stadium – maybe due to the introduction of a new football, the occasion or just the gulf in skills between the two sets of players – the dream did not materialise in the way Morocco wanted. .A French masterclass on the pitch ensured the Atlas Lions will not finish higher than third in the World Cup. .“This is football, that’s how it works,” Fatima, a Moroccan supporter, said after the 2-0 loss. “But we’re really proud of the team. Moroccan football has totally changed now. This is not a loss, no way. We are the champions.” .As the final whistle blew, a team huddle took place in the middle. The French team celebrated their progress to a second successive final. Morocco, meanwhile, soaked in what they had achieved: glory, respect and unprecedented heights. .There were shouts of “Morocco, Morocco” and “seer, seer” (go, go) from the stands, although not in unison like the previous matches. While some made an early exit, the majority in red and green stayed back, applauding the players who performed one last prostration in prayer on the field. .“Proud, proud, proud. That’s how I’m feeling right now,” Amine, another Moroccan supporter, said. “They made history, they’re still a young team and now we have ambition for future world cups. We’re not going to give up now. It’s a change of a mindset, there’s a winning mentality instilled in the players, the team and the country now. This will change our future generations.” .For Youssra, it was the performance and not the result on the pitch that made her cry. .“I’m a bit emotional but not disappointed,” she said. “It’s been amazing so far. We’re super happy and super proud. They’ve made history. They’re fighters. We’re supporting them till the end, no matter what.” .For the France-born Shaima, it was a bittersweet win. .“My parents are from Morocco so I was supporting Morocco tonight. They did something great. They showed the world that a team from Africa can really achieve something great.” .Morocco will be back for one last hurrah on Saturday in the third-place playoff against Croatia, the team against which the Atlas Lions’ fairy tale journey began at Qatar 2022 last month. .There will still be chants of “seer, seer” inside Khalifa International Stadium, with renewed vigour and hopes that the deadlock against the same opponents from November is bettered. .For some travelling fans though, winning or losing on Saturday will not take the gloss away from the “dream run”. .“We’re so, so proud of the Lions,” Lamia said. “Not one of us could’ve dreamt that our team will reach the semi-finals of the World Cup. We really want to win third place but it’s fine if it doesn’t happen. We’ve already done more than what we could’ve imagined.”",49

There were similar scenes on Thursday outside a Doha hotel where Argentina football federation officials are staying. .“We have told them we don’t have any tickets to offer them but they still insist on staying here,” said a ticketing office staff who asked to remain anonymous. .Mattias, who had been outside the ticket office for four hours, said maintaining a presence is the only way of getting noticed by FIFA and the host country’s organising team. .“If we stay here and protest peacefully, we might hear something but if we leave, no one is going to listen to us,” he said. .Argentina, who qualified for the final after beating Croatia on Tuesday, will take on holders France on December 18. .The travelling fans of the Albiceleste have been providing raucous support for their team during their run in the tournament. Thousands of drumbeating, singing and dancing fans have been present inside stadiums during every Argentina game, and have continued their celebrations outside after every successive win. .Maria Parreira, who has been to every Argentina game thus far, said she was disappointed to see that football’s governing body has done little to help the 30,000 or so Argentinians who have travelled to Qatar for the tournament. .Parreira said most fans who made the 13,000km (8,100-mile) journey from Argentina “burned their savings”, and will go back home with empty pockets because that is what football means to them. .Should their team win an elusive third title, however, it will be worth every penny spent for the die-hard travelling supporters. .“We want to create the same atmosphere and support our team all the way to the end, so imagine if we can’t be inside the stadium after draining our bank accounts just because some people want to rip us off,” a teary-eyed Parreira said, referring to a racket of resellers in the black market, both online and in person at various locations across Qatar. .Despite FIFA’s warnings on reselling tickets out of its official platforms, several thousand tickets have been sold illegally, throughout the World Cup and for the final, as well. .With the growing desperation to watch the all-important final, which is also possibly the last World Cup match of Argentina captain Lionel Messi’s career, individuals have been quoting prices up to eight times the face value of tickets. .One of the hundreds of such resellers, who declined to give their name, was present outside the ticketing office and was seen offering a 3,650 Qatari riyal ($1,000) ticket for 10,000 riyals ($2,800). .Another person, who also declined to give his name, claimed to have various tickets for the final and said he will be selling them at five times the face value because there was a high demand and they were going for such high prices elsewhere. .Fans like Parreira and her friend Juan Pablo, who has travelled from a small village outside Cordoba, Argentina, said they simply cannot pay such high amounts. .Pablo has followed Argentina’s journey since their qualification round matches, and arrived in Qatar in October in order to help fellow travellers. .“I went to Russia [2018], I travelled all over South America to watch them qualify and now that they are in the final, I can’t be there because officials from football federations, sponsors and celebrities are being offered the seats that should have been reserved for us,” Pablo said with a sigh. .The AFP news agency reported that each country that qualified for the quarterfinals has been handed extra tickets for the additional matches the team was playing in. .FIFA has not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on ticket allocation, distribution and resale.",50
51,Published On 14 Dec 2022,Morocco fans honour their team despite semifinal loss,Morocco’s prodigious run at the World Cup has finally come to an end.,".Al Khor, Qatar – Morocco’s dreams of reaching the World Cup final were dashed after a 2-0 loss to France in the last four. .After reaching the semifinals of the world’s most prestigious event – the first time in history for an African or Arab-majority country – the Atlas Lions were ultimately brought down by the mighty France on Wednesday. .“We are a little upset, I won’t lie,” Hassan Chadilly, from Casablanca, told Al Jazeera at Al Bayt Stadium. .“After we kept winning the knockout games we had a lot of hope. Sadly we could not do it again”. .However, Chadily said Moroccans everywhere were “very proud” of the team. .“We have the most wonderful players in the world … the coach [Walid Regragui], the training staff. I will never forget being here in Qatar during such a historic time for our country”, Chadily, who is a Dubai resident, said. .There was no recreation, however, of the boisterous and euphoric scenes the world has come to see from Morocco fans during the tournament in the past few weeks. .A few people could be seen jumping and shouting Dima Maghrib (Always Morocco) as they left the stadium but nowhere near with the same enthusiasm as when the Atlas Lions shocked Portugal last week, or Spain and Belgium before them. .“I was really hoping we could meet Argentina in the final … but France were better than us,” Yassine Bouziane told Al Jazeera. .“But I’m not sad, honestly. They did the best they could do. No one expected this”, the Tangier resident said. “They made so many people happy – all the Muslims around the world, the Arabs and the people of Africa.” .France will take on Argentina on Sunday in the final at Lusail Stadium, while Morocco will fight it out with Croatia for third place on December 17.",51
52,Published On 14 Jan 2023,FIFA to investigate Argentina over World Cup final behaviour,FIFA says Argentina potentially breached rules regarding ‘offensive behaviour and violations of the principles of fair play’.,".FIFA says it has opened disciplinary proceedings against Argentina for “offensive behaviour” during the team’s World Cup final triumph in Qatar last month. .Argentina beat 2018 winners France on penalties to lift the trophy for a third time. .Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez made a lewd gesture with his goalkeeper of the tournament trophy after the match, before being filmed in the dressing room mocking French star Kylian Mbappe. .Mbappe won the FIFA Golden Boot trophy after scoring the most goals in the tournament. .Football’s world governing body said Argentina had potentially breached rules regarding “offensive behaviour and violations of the principles of fair play” and “misconduct of players and officials”. .FIFA is also investigating the Argentinian FA over breaching media and marketing regulations. .Martinez has also come under criticism from pundits and social media for mocking Mbappe during Argentina’s victory parade in Buenos Aires – where he held a baby doll with the French player’s face plastered on it. .The Croatian team is also being investigated for potential violations of “discrimination” and “order and security at matches” rules. .Players appeared to sing a song with fascist connotations following their third-place playoff victory over Morocco. .Defender Dejan Lovren defended himself and his teammates, recently telling AFP news agency it was “a patriotic song which relates to my country, which means that I love my country”. .Meanwhile, FIFA said it had fined Mexico 100,000 Swiss francs ($107,840) for chants by its supporters during the team’s game against Poland and Saudi Arabia during the group stages. .The team will also be forced to play one FIFA competition match behind closed doors.",52
53,Published On 9 Jan 2023,Roberto Martinez appointed new Portugal coach,"Martinez replaces Fernando Santos, who left his job after Portugal suffered a shock defeat to Morocco in the 2022 World Cup quarterfinals.",".Portugal have named former Belgium coach Roberto Martinez as their new manager and the Spaniard said he would sit down with star player Cristiano Ronaldo to talk about his future with the team. .Martinez, 49, replaces Fernando Santos, who left his job after Portugal suffered a shock defeat by Morocco in the World Cup quarterfinals. .“I appreciate the enthusiasm and ambition with which he [Martinez] received the invitation,” Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) President Fernando Gomes told a news conference on Monday as Martinez stood next to him. .“This is an important moment for the national team,” he said. .Martinez stepped down as Belgium coach following their World Cup group stage exit, saying he had made the decision to end his six-year tenure some time ago and would have left even if they had been crowned champions. .It ended a long spell in charge of the side in which he took them to number one in the world rankings and third place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. .“I am delighted to be able to represent one of the most talented teams in the world,” Martinez said. “I understand there are great expectations … but I also understand there is a very large team [at the FFF] … and together we will achieve our goals.” .The 68-year-old Santos, who was widely criticised for his tactics and for leaving forward Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench for two consecutive World Cup games, became Portugal coach in 2014 and led the country in 109 matches. .They won the European Championship in 2016 and UEFA’s inaugural Nations League in 2018-19. .Questioned about the future of Ronaldo in the national team, Martinez said that he would contact the 37-year-old, who last month joined Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on a two-and-a-half-year deal. .“I want to contact all 26 players who were at the last World Cup … Cristiano is a player on that list,” he said, adding he would “sit down and talk” with the forward, who is his country’s all-time record scorer with 118 goals.",53
54,Published On 28 Dec 2022,The stories that changed Latin America in 2022,The past year saw a political swing leftward in countries like Brazil and Colombia as well as crises and World Cup gold.,".The last twelve months have seen several major changes in Latin America, as 2022 brought elections, scandals and one major sports triumph. .Politically, a leftward swing has continued to shake up governments across the region, with some experts calling the trend a new “pink tide”. Colombia elected its first left-wing leader, and in neighbouring Brazil, former union leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva defeated far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro to become the country’s next president. .Meanwhile, myriad crises have continued, with Haiti falling further into insecurity, and El Salvador accused of widespread human rights abuses in its crackdown on deadly gang violence. .In the world of sport, there was at least one positive note to end the year, with Argentina winning the World Cup championship — marking the first time in 20 years that a Latin American team has brought home the trophy. .Here are the stories that defined 2022: .Lula beats Bolsonaro in Brazil’s presidential election .Hailed as his party’s “phoenix”, Lula saw a remarkable reversal of fortunes in 2022, securing a narrow victory in Brazil’s run-off election against current right-wing president Bolsonaro. .The election came just more than a year and a half after a Brazilian Supreme Court judge quashed all corruption convictions against Lula, who spent 580 days in prison. .The left-wing leader, who previously served as president from 2003 to 2011, promised to be an antidote to the Trumpian Bolsonaro, running on a platform of economic and social justice in response to widespread inequality and poverty in Brazil. .During a raucous reception at the United Nations COP27 climate conference in Egypt, Lula also pledged to reassert Brazil – home to large portions of the Amazon rainforest – as a global leader in environmentalism. He is set to be inaugurated on January 1. .Overlapping crises in Haiti have only worsened over the last year, with the country’s top diplomat to the US openly appealing for controversial foreign intervention. .Following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, armed gangs have taken control of large swathes of the country. .In November, Ulrika Richardson, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in the country, told reporters that gangs were using sexual violence to “instill fear and to punish and to terrorise the local populations”. She estimated that 60 percent of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince had fallen under gang domination. .The insecurity has crippled aid delivery to the country, where half the population faces acute food shortages, according to the World Food Programme, and where cholera cases have spiked at the year’s end. .It was the progressive overhaul that was not. .Championed by left-wing President Gabriel Boric, the proposed constitution would have replaced the current charter — adopted during the rule of military dictator Augusto Pinochet — with a document that places greater emphasis on social rights, the environment and gender equality. .But the new charter was soundly rejected by Chileans in September, with 61.9 percent voting against adoption and 38.1 percent voting in favour. .While many support the concept of a new constitution, critics said September’s proposal lacked a clear structure and overreached in key areas. In December, legislators from both the country’s left and right agreed to begin drafting another attempt. .A quicksilver series of events on December 7 saw Peru’s President Pedro Castillo attempt to dissolve Congress, get impeached and end up behind bars. .It all played out in just a few hours, capped by the swearing-in of Castillo’s former vice president, Dina Boluarte, to the top job. In the process, Boluarte became Peru’s first female president. .Unrest among Castillo’s supporters quickly grew, sparking protests, and clashes with police and military left over 20 people dead. .To diffuse the tension, Boluarte appealed to Peru’s Congress to move general elections up from 2026 to 2023. An initial attempt failed to gain enough votes in the legislature, but on December 20, the opposition-led Congress tentatively approved a constitutional reform that would make it possible to move the election forward. The plan must still be ratified by a two-thirds majority. .At least 15 media workers were killed in Mexico in 2022, according to an Associated Press tally, making it the deadliest year for journalists in three decades. .Mexico was second only to war-torn Ukraine in the number of journalists killed during the year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), with observers citing the prominence of criminal gangs, complicity of local officials, and government inaction for the rise. .The violence was punctuated in December by a brazen attack on Ciro Gomez Leyva, one of Mexico’s most prominent radio and television reporters, according to CPJ. He survived the Mexico City attack thanks to bulletproof armour on his vehicle. .“I’m Argentinian! It’s a feeling I can’t contain,” sang revellers in the country’s capital of Buenos Aires after the national team, led by superstar Lionel Messi, defeated France to win the World Cup, international football’s biggest event. .It was the first time since 1986 that Argentina took home the World Cup trophy — and the first time in decades that any Latin American team triumphed in the final. .Fans wearing the colours of Argentina’s blue-and-white flag descended upon Qatar, this year’s World Cup host, underscoring the team’s uniquely international reach. .But it came down to a nailbiter, with 23-year-old French striker Kylian Mbappe nearly swiping the championship with a Herculean hat trick in the waning minutes of the match. .With France and Argentina tied at three goals apiece, the tournament champion was crowned through penalty kicks. But the trophy ultimately came home to the house that Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona built. .A leftward trend across Latin America continued with the June presidential victory of Gustavo Petro in Colombia. .Petro, a former rebel fighter who ran on a platform of profound social and economic change, became the first left-wing president in a country that has long marginalised the left for its perceived association with years of armed conflict. .Meanwhile, Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, became the country’s first Afro-Colombian female vice president. .In early December, residents of Soyapango, a densely populated municipality on the outskirts of San Salvador, woke up to 10,000 police and military personnel on the streets. .It was the latest move in a controversial gang crackdown by president Nayib Bukele. In March, the government imposed a state of exception that suspended some civil liberties and led to the mass incarceration of nearly 60,000 Salvadorans. .Rights groups have documented an array of abuses since the crackdown began, including violations of due process, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and deaths in custody. .Shocking video captured a man pointing a gun at the head of Argentina’s Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner outside of her Buenos Aires home in September. .The attacker pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Fernandez de Kirchner, who was under investigation for corruption at the time, survived unscathed. The gunman, meanwhile, was arrested. .In early December, Fernandez de Kirchner was sentenced to six years in prison on charges that she fraudulently awarded public works contracts to a family friend in Patagonia, a stronghold for her political career. .She remains in office and has said she plans to appeal the conviction. .Panama’s National Migration Service said in October that 151,582 migrants and refugees had crossed the Darien Gap, an inhospitable stretch of mountainous jungle between Columbia and Panama, since January. .The number set a new record, surpassing the 133,726 crossings recorded in 2021, with the increase attributed to the economic fallout of COVID-19 and an uptick of people leaving Venezuela. .The 106km (66-mile) trek can take more than a week, with many bound for the US border. There, they often met with expulsion under Title 42, a policy invoked under former US President Donald Trump that allows border agents to turn away most people crossing the border as a COVID-19 prevention. .In mid-December, Title 42 was set to expire. But in response to a request from mainly Republican lawmakers, the US Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments over whether states can challenge ending the policy. It will remain in place until at least February, when the case is scheduled.",54
55,Published On 26 Dec 2022,"Ronaldo dropped because of ‘political ban’, says Erdogan","Turkish leader says the Portuguese footballer is ‘someone who stands for the Palestinian cause’, despite a lack of public statements by him on Palestine.",".Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said Cristiano Ronaldo was subjected to a “political ban” at the World Cup, as he compared the Portuguese footballer to Lionel Messi. .“They have wasted Ronaldo. Unfortunately, they have imposed a political ban on him,” Erdogan said on Sunday while speaking at a youth event in the eastern Erzurum province. .“Sending a footballer like Ronaldo to the pitch with just 30 minutes remaining to the match ruined his psychology and took away his energy,” Erdogan said. .“Ronaldo is someone who stands for the Palestinian cause,” he added. .The 37-year-old came on as a substitute in the second half of a World Cup quarterfinal game against Morocco in which Portugal lost 1-0. .The former Manchester United and Real Madrid footballer had also been on the bench when Portugal took on Switzerland in the round of 16, making an appearance as a substitute. .The loss against Morocco meant that Ronaldo, the only player to score in five separate World Cups, was eliminated from what will most likely be his last World Cup, and was unable to hold back his tears as he walked towards the changing rooms. .Ronaldo has never issued any public statements on the Israel-Palestine conflict, despite false reports and doctored photos emerging periodically online. .A widely-circulated story that Ronaldo had donated 1.5m euros ($1.59m) to Palestinians after he auctioned off a golden boot award was denied in 2019 by a sports management company representing the footballer. .An image of Ronaldo holding a sign saying “Together with the Palestinians” in Spanish that was widely shared online was also doctored and was in fact an expression of support for the victims of an earthquake in Spain in 2011. .Ronaldo has been pictured with a Palestinian scarf around his shoulders, but it represented the Palestinian Football Association, and the ex-Real Madrid and Manchester United player was standing next to the head of that association, Jibril Rajoub. .Ronaldo has also met several Israeli ministers and has been photographed presenting one of his football shirts to ex-Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz.",55
56,Published On 24 Dec 2022,‘Tis the season: The post-World Cup Christmas blues,"For some of us, the World Cup consumed so much festive joy that there is little left for Christmas.",".When the World Cup kicked off in November, I was rooting for Mexico. Having resided off and on in the coastal town of Zipolite in Mexico’s southern Oaxaca state since the start of the pandemic, I had already amassed a good quantity of Mexican football shirts, and I watched the games at a café on the beach, where a television had been set up on a table in the sand. .A traditional Mexican blanket was hung to deflect the glare of the sun, and an altar was erected below the TV comprising burning incense, a green candle bearing the image of Jesus Christ, an enlarged photograph of Mexican goalie Guillermo Ochoa, and assorted good luck charms. A small audience would gather with the beer the Mexican TV commentators in Qatar had encouraged us to imbibe on their behalf, and the 90 minutes would pass in animated camaraderie, with plenty of hollering and colourful Mexican swear words. .Little did we know that, upon the elimination of the Mexican team, Morocco would replace Mexico in our hearts – in my case rather literally. With the help of a laundry pin, a piece of paper, and red nail polish, I amended the MEXICO emblazoned across the chest of one of my jerseys. The letters OROC took the place of EXI, and I was ready to go. .The match viewings on the Zipolite beach became even livelier, and much beer was spilled as Morocco defeated Spain and then Portugal. The Moroccan team awakened feelings inside me I didn’t know I had – sentiments that under normal circumstances I would have resisted as unforgivably cheesy, but that I now fully embraced. I lived for Morocco – and, from my plastic chair on the sand, I squealed, yelped, convulsed, and dug my fingernails into the arm of the man next to me, in accordance with every development on the football field. .In a sport from which capitalism has done its best to purge any vestige of joy, Morocco had put the magic back in the game. By winning against former European colonisers, celebrating solidarity with Palestine, and generally emanating pure humanity, the Moroccan players made it clear that the 2022 World Cup was about something much more than scoring goals. And this, in turn, made us all feel like we were part of something much bigger than ourselves. .When Morocco lost to France on December 14, I commenced crying at minute 80 of the match and didn’t stop for two hours, as the defeat had apparently also triggered the release of all pent-up emotions for the year. With the World Cup officially over on December 18 and the Mexico-Morocco jersey retired to the heap of clothes on my couch, it was time to transition into Christmas mode – the problem being that nothing seemed very festive any more. .Until now, Christmas had always been an occasion of cosy nostalgia for me, despite my abandonment of religion decades ago when my Catholic middle school teacher in Texas informed me that my dog wasn’t going to heaven. This year, however, the holidays just weren’t cutting it in terms of warmth and fuzziness, as all the magic seemed to have been consumed by the World Cup. I placed a dilapidated lit-up Santa Claus in the middle of my kitchen counter in Zipolite in the hopes of provoking some sort of holiday spirit, but all I could think about was Morocco. .Call it the post-World Cup Christmas blues. .Of course, for many of the world’s World Cup enthusiasts, the comedown from the tournament entailed not so much a return to the tedium of daily existence as a return to daily torment. Consider Lebanon, which is currently contending with a full-blown economic apocalypse, a ruling elite hellbent on the destruction of everything minus their own power, and the perennial predations of neighbouring Israel – to list but a few aspects of the contemporary Lebanese predicament. .A Lebanese friend of mine in Beirut religiously followed the World Cup matches, some of them transmitted with a three-minute delay on account of Lebanon’s eternal technical difficulties. He reported that, following the final showdown between Argentina and France, people were “celebrating here like Lebanon won”, with convoys of vehicles waving Argentinian flags clogging the streets of the Lebanese capital. .Judging from past Lebanese reactions to international football outcomes, the same spectacle would have undoubtedly ensued no matter which country won the World Cup – just with different flags. Now, with the palliative of the beautiful game over for Lebanese football fans, it’s back to a reality of national self-combustion. .For Palestinians, too, football has been known to provide a welcome distraction from Israeli military persecution and butchery – except, obviously, when Israel does things like massacre Palestinian children playing football on the beach. This year in Qatar, the Moroccan team’s decision to place the Palestinian cause front and centre – in defiance of the Moroccan government’s own normalisation with Israel – bumped the World Cup up to a whole new level of special. .Meanwhile back in Mexico – where life for the average Mexican is hardly all fun and games, either – football offers many people a fleeting escape from a national landscape of US-inflicted neoliberal wreckage and a bloody US-sponsored “war on drugs” that amounts to a war on the poor. .And with the post-World Cup Christmas blues now upon us, we might take solace in the fact that we only have to wait 3.5 years for the next one – which, mercifully, will not take place right before Christmas. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",56
57,Published On 22 Dec 2022,The 10 players who caught our eye at the World Cup,"From Musiala to Aboubakar to Amrabat, here are the 10 players that impressed us most at this World Cup.",".Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe gave us a World Cup final for the ages at Lusail Stadium on Sunday night. It felt fitting that two of football’s biggest protagonists took centre stage on the biggest night of the tournament. .But away from the spotlight the two rightly occupy, there were 10 other players that made us sit up and take notice at this World Cup. .Argentina’s World Cup triumph was built on the performances of a genius up front and the genius Emiliano Martinez between the posts. Martinez has been otherworldly over the past month and the three clean sheets he kept was the highest tally in the tournament. .But Martinez’s true value came in his ability to stand tall under pressure. He made an incredible save in the dying minutes of Argentina’s Round of 16 game to deny Australia an equaliser and saved the Netherlands’s first two penalties in the quarterfinal shootout. .And then, of course, there was his performance in the final. .His save with his feet of Kolo Muani’s shot towards the end of extra time gets better with each viewing. He set the tone in the penalty shootout by saving Kingsley Coman’s attempt and then getting into the head of Aurelian Tchouameni, who shot wide. .Joško Gvardiol .The 20-year-old RB Leipzig centre back was arguably the best defender at the tournament. His poise and power formed the bedrock of Croatia’s run to the semifinal. .While Messi ran circles around him in the semifinal, Gvardiol’s response in the subsequent third-place game against Morocco showed his strength of character. A Man of the Match performance, which included a stunning goal from a diving header, made clear why Europe’s biggest clubs are vying for his signature. .The Manchester City starlet scored four goals at this World Cup despite starting the tournament as the backup striker. .What is as impressive as the goals is how different each was. The goal against Poland in the Round of 16 came on the back of a well-worked move he fired into the top corner, the one against Australia came from his doggedness and the brace against Croatia was down to his burst of speed and smart positional play. .He is the perfect foil for Messi in that he is in sync with Messi’s runs and yet occupies different spaces on the pitch. .Going into the World Cup, he was best known as the brother of Nordin Amrabat, the former Watford defender. .But his battling performances for Morocco at this World Cup have made him the toast of the footballing world. .Amrabat was immense in his deep-lying midfielder role. He imposed himself all over the pitch and was the conduit between the backline and the forwards. .His crunching tackle of Mbappe in the semifinal was one of the moments of the tournament. .Jude Bellingham is not just good for his age, he is just plain good. .The 19-year-old played a starring role in England’s World Cup campaign. He started every game, scored their first goal of the tournament against Iran and created the goal that broke the deadlock in their first knockout game. .He is as confident as he is classy. Only Mbappe had more goal-creating actions than Bellingham at this World Cup. . .Cody Gakpo was the Netherlands’s best player at this World Cup. In five games, he scored three goals and gave Louis van Gaal’s side the cutting edge they lacked elsewhere on the pitch. .His non-penalty xG was 2.7 – the highest of the tournament. .The 23-year-old has been tearing defences up in the Eredivisie all year but questions remained over his ability to do so in an international tournament. .The naysayers got their answer. Gakpo did not just perform, he thrived. .Griezmann’s role in France’s run to the final cannot be understated. He plugged the hole of Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante’s absence with his craft and toil, from a deeper role than we are used to seeing him in. .His playmaking allowed Aurélien Tchouaméni and Adrien Rabiot to focus on their defensive responsibilities. .Griezmann’s tracking back and ability to win loose balls only furthered his importance to this France team. .Musiala was the only bright spot in Germany’s dismal World Cup campaign. .The 19-year-old was electric in midfield and, at times, it felt like he was carrying the team. .His best performance came against Spain in the group stages. While his teammates’ heads drooped around him after Spain’s opener, Musiala remained positive and continued to probe the Spanish defence. Unsurprisingly, he played a key role in their late equaliser. .If Germany are to bounce back from their debacle of successive group-stage exits, they need to build the team around him. .Cameroon’s captain was one of the heroes of the group stages. .With Cameroon 3-1 down to Serbia and on the brink of elimination, Aboubakar entered the fray as a second-half substitute and turned the game on his head. He emphatically chipped the keeper to pull a goal back and then provided the assist for the equaliser. .In their final game against Brazil, he scored an injury-time winner and gave Cameroon their first World Cup win in 20 years. His celebration after that goal will become a part of World Cup folklore. .Brazil’s shock exit in the quarterfinal has wiped clean everything that came in their campaign before. So, it is easy to forget Richarlison’s inspired performances in the earlier rounds. .Leading the line for Brazil in a World Cup is not easy but Richarlison rose to the occasion. Quite literally, in fact. His acrobatic scissor kick in Brazil’s opening game against Serbia was one of the goals of the tournament. However, his goal against South Korea in the Round of 16 gave it strong competition. .Still only 25, we will be seeing a lot more of him for Brazil.",57
58,Published On 21 Dec 2022,Lionel Messi’s win is a triumph of genius and tolerance,"With the ball and the bisht, the Argentine superstar faced questions — but the champion prevailed each time.",".Despite the tattoos and beard, Lionel Messi still looks like a little boy who loves playing a game with a ball. .This is the simplicity and beauty that Messi will always be remembered by – a boy with a ball who astonished the world with his wondrous skills and humility. .What a privilege it has been to watch Messi fulfil his dream of becoming a world champion with his talented teammates and a grateful nation by his side. .There seemed to be an inevitability to Messi’s triumph. Having faltered against Saudi Arabia in an opening-round match, the wonder from Argentina was apparently determined not to be disappointed again. .In game after game, he made the ball his own, conjuring up goals with his marvellous feet and imagination. .And after each goal, in a familiar and touching ritual, Messi pointed to the sky with a kiss in homage to a grandmother who knew that, given the chance, the diminutive prodigy could make a ball do magical things. .“Put him on and you’ll see how well the little boy plays,” Messi’s late grandmother told a sceptical coach a long time ago. .That “little boy” has repaid her faith in him many times over many years – from Rosario, Argentina to Barcelona and Paris. He has become rich and famous. Perhaps as famous and adored as Muhammad Ali. .But Messi has not forgotten that it all began with a pitch, a ball and a grandmother’s hope. Unlike some of his contemporaries, the fame, wealth and adoration have not turned the charmed boy with a ball into a preening prima donna. .Messi shares the explosions of joy he is responsible for with the rest of us. His outstretched arms invite us to join in the celebration. He wants us to feel what he feels in those pristine moments – happiness. .He did it again and again in Qatar. So, Messi will be remembered for his generosity, too. He reminded us of when we were young and the bliss we tasted, from time to time, while playing football in the sun. .After winning the World Cup, Messi stood ramrod straight on a white podium waiting to hoist the trophy. The emir of Qatar offered Messi a “bisht”, a traditional black, gold-rimmed Arab cloak. .Messi received the garment which is bestowed as a sign of respect with a nod and a smile. He applauded. Messi understood, it seems to me, that it was important to pause to recognise that while he was Argentinian, he, like Ali, belonged to the world at that time, in that place. .By donning the bisht, Messi also embraced tolerance and understanding that his hosts would do well to remember. He rejected, as well, the predictable cynicism and racism of the tournament’s petty gallery of insular naysayers. Their vitriol and ignorance only underscored the strength of the man who, throughout his career, has celebrated the diversity that the World Cup embodies. .That strength was on display whenever Messi was tested during the tournament. .A two-goal lead against the Netherlands in a raucous quarterfinal evaporated in an instant. Rather than wilt, Messi – perhaps spurred on by the Dutch coach’s suggestion that he was not much of a force – played with singular purpose and a determination to prevail in a breathtaking penalty shootout. .Next, against a stubborn Croatia, Messi’s genius was in full bloom. His memorable run began on the touchline near mid-field. He nudged the ball ahead while a defender tried, in vain, to thwart the brilliance to come. As he darted towards the goal, Messi stopped, bobbed and weaved, the ball following him unquestioningly. Then he slipped the ball passed the bewildered defender and onto a teammate’s welcoming foot. .The goal produced a roar – a mixture of amazement and admiration – that a few special athletes can elicit. Messi turned, arms aloft, towards the pulsating stands. In return, the crowd shouted “Messi,” “Messi,” “Messi”, as if to acknowledge the phenomenon they and we had just witnessed. .It was, to my mind, the moment of the tournament – when a great athlete confirmed his greatness and shared it with an awe-struck audience near and far. .Now, formidable France – and, in particular, its elegant striker, Kylian Mbappé –­ stood between Messi and history. .Up 2-0 with 10 minutes or so until full-time, the World Cup seemed in Messi’s grasp – finally. France, however, showed their mettle. Mbappé scored twice, sending an already stunning match into the frenzy of extra time. .Messi was tested once more. Doubt and disillusionment were replaced by a champion’s will to win. Messi prodded home another goal before Mbappé replied. .On to penalties. When the drama was over, Messi dropped to his knees, overwhelmed and relieved before he was engulfed by his teammates and coaches. We were there with him in spirit, thankful that an incomparable player – that “little boy” with a ball – had won the trophy that had eluded him. .Messi’s grandmother would have been proud. .She would have been proud not only because he had won, but of the quiet grace that her grandson then showed by accepting a simple gesture of gratitude from his hosts for showcasing his incomparable talents on the grandest stage of all. .With the golden cup in hand and the bisht draped around him, Messi hopped and shouted with joy — and we hopped and shouted with joy alongside. .Messi’s journey from Rosario to Doha transcends borders and nationalities. Messi is proof that it is possible to reach the pinnacle and retain the modesty that his humble beginnings and grandmother no doubt ingrained in him. .Football is a global sport and Messi is its global ambassador. We are fortunate to be able to watch the marvel dance with a ball. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",58
59,Published On 20 Dec 2022,Morocco’s Atlas Lions receive hero’s welcome on return home,"The national team made history in this year’s FIFA World Cup after beating elite teams Belgium, Portugal and Spain.",".Morocco’s national football team have received a hero’s welcome upon their return home after accomplishing the seemingly impossible feat of finishing fourth at the World Cup in Qatar. .After their plane touched down on Tuesday, the players rode an open-top bus through the major avenues of the capital, Rabat. With flares, chants and flags, thousands of Moroccans turned out to greet the players, who injected new energy into African and Arab football. .Underdogs Morocco, known as the Atlas Lions, conquered hearts with their never-say-die attitude and made history as one of the big success stories of this year’s tournament. .Morocco defeated elite teams, beating second-ranked Belgium, stunning 2010 champions Spain in a penalty shootout in the last 16, and continuing their impressive run with a 1-0 win against 2016 European champions Portugal, before stumbling against the defending champions France. Along the way, the Atlas Lions became the first African and Arab country to reach a World Cup semifinal. .The players’ record-setting performance earned them a special celebration by fans, as police stood guard in the streets of Rabat. Big crowds lined the streets and the rest of the North African kingdom for the homecoming. .Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque, reporting from Rabat, described an “ocean of red and green” greeting the national team. .“The people of Morocco are roaring to welcome the Atlas Lions. There is so much pride. I was in the crowd earlier and I met people who came all the way from Holland to witness this moment. Children, families, women, grandparents coming here to witness this moment together,” Haque said. .“There’s such a level of communion that this team has brought to Morocco. As the bus moves slowly towards the palace of the king, you can see crowds of people running behind the bus.” .The royal court said on Monday that King Mohammed VI would receive the team at the palace in Rabat “to celebrate their great and historic accomplishment”. .The team finished fourth in the competition after losing to Croatia 1-2 in the third-place playoff on Saturday, exceeding the expectations of most Moroccans. .“This team has brought so much joy, not only to the people of Morocco, but also to Africans, the Arab world and to millions of Moroccans who live abroad. This team of 11 players, most of them are dual nationals. And there’s pride in being received like this by their country of origin,” Haque said. .The Moroccan team charmed many Arab football fans who saw in the team a reflection of themselves. Players waved the Palestinian flag after their wins and celebrated on the field with their mothers and children. .The team also galvanised support across Africa. .“If someone had told me before the tournament that we would play seven matches in Qatar, we would have been happy,” Morocco coach Walid Regragui told BeIN Sports. .“All Moroccan, African and Arab people have seen how this team fought and wanted to make the country happy … We will try to return after four years,” added the 47-year-old coach, who only took charge in August.",59
60,Published On 20 Dec 2022,The Atlas Lions kindled a sense of belonging in Europe,The success of the Moroccan team is a tale of identity redemption for Moroccan diaspora communities.,".The Altas Lions’ history-making run at the Qatar 2022 World Cup may have come to an end, but their victories are still making waves off the pitch. For us, members of the Moroccan diaspora living in Western Europe, this was a transformative experience. .Throughout the tournament, Moroccans of all generations gathered to watch the matches and celebrate the triumph of the Moroccan team. We felt an unprecedented rush of pride that gave a new impetus to our evolving identity. .Historically, identity-building in the Moroccan community in Western Europe has been challenging. We have long felt a lack of true belonging in our “host countries” and have never really had a cohesive identity, given the diversity of Morocco’s own population and its Amazigh, Arab and African elements. .But this World Cup changed that. In my conversations with fellow Moroccans living in Europe, I have seen how the Atlas Lions’ mountainous achievements have inspired them to embrace and take pride in their Moroccanness. .The words of the great Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish reflecting on displacement and belonging strike a chord with the Moroccan diaspora in Europe: “I am from there, I am from here, but I am neither there, nor here.” This is how many of us feel. .Today there are between three and five million Moroccans and people of Moroccan descent living in Europe. Many of them came to countries like the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Germany as labourers during the post-World War II period of economic growth in Western Europe. .In a political climate in which migration and diversity are increasingly seen as a problem and Islamophobia is growing, Moroccans in Europe have felt othered. Many first- and second-generation Moroccan-Europeans, have felt disconnected from both the country they live in and the country they hail from – including myself. .My fear of being excluded in Belgium, the country I was born in, is especially exacerbated by routine encounters with racism and the rise and normalisation of right-wing rhetoric across Europe amid the “migrant crisis”. Rather than inspire compassion, images of refugees arriving from across the Mediterranean have justified and amplified the othering of my community in Europe. .Yet many of us have not found a sense of belonging in the land of our ancestors either. When we visit Morocco, we often get identified as “not truly Moroccan”. Part of it has to do with the pressure we feel to hide or shed elements of our Moroccan identity. .“It is almost like I am ashamed of showing my Moroccanness, because it makes me less Spanish, and also because I am not purely Moroccan because I didn’t grow up there,” my friend Nouredine, who was born and raised in Spain, told me. .A Moroccan couple, who live in Belgium, also shared with me that they have spoken only French to their young children because they are afraid of racist abuse if they spoke Arabic in public. “We regret that decision,” they told me. Their children now feel locked out of Moroccan culture because they do not speak their heritage language. .Many Moroccans believe that such “integration” efforts would make their host society accept them. However, not only has this linguistic assimilation not changed their precarious position in society, but it has also alienated them from their own community who do not understand – and perhaps even judge – their decision. .Another challenge for diaspora Moroccans has been the lack of cohesion within the Moroccan community driven by ethnic, linguistic and cultural divides. Perched on the intersection of Amazigh, African and Arab cultures and histories, the Moroccan identity is quite complex and fluid. As the World Cup showed, there are debates in and out of Morocco on which element is dominant or defines the nation. .As a linguist currently researching language as a barrier to healthcare for the Moroccan community in Brussels, I am confronted with the challenges of linguistic diversity within my community. We have a total of four languages: Moroccan-Arabic or Darija, Amazigh – the language of the Indigenous people of Morocco – has another three varieties: Tarifit, Tamazight and Tachelhit. .Although I can speak Darija and Tachelhit, I face an obstacle with community members who only speak the two other Amazigh varieties. The linguistic barrier extends to the rest of my community, as those who do not speak Darija as a lingua franca tend to mainly stick to the group who speaks the same Amazigh variety as them. .I met Racha, a medical student who grew up in France, when we were both watching a public screening of the Morocco-Canada match. Though complete strangers, we instantly connected as Moroccans, and we cheered and celebrated together. .“I think I have never been so proud of being Moroccan, and for the first time in my life [I saw] a good representation of Morocco: the supporter chants; their traditional clothes; our values of respecting our parents, especially our mothers; to keep praying whether we win or lose,” she told me in a message afterwards. .For many of us, the coverage of the Moroccan squad’s winning streak was the first time we saw positive news about Moroccans. Though tensions with the police escalated in a few Western European cities and clouded some of the celebrations, international media embraced the Moroccan fans and their squad. .Laudatory news articles and social media posts about the Moroccan players and fans unleashed a display of Moroccan-ness I had never seen before in Europe. It opened the door for my fellow community members to show pride in their Moroccan heritage, both in the street and on social media. .It was an experience of feeling represented, accepted, not othered. During the match between Belgium and Morocco, Nora, an accountant and a Belgian national, told me she was proudly cheering for Morocco because as she put it, the Moroccan team “look like us”. .Seeing ourselves represented in the final stages of the World Cup, a space that had seemed unreachable thus far, has filled the next generation of diaspora Moroccans with the courage to dream big. .Nine-year-old Adam, was born and raised in France to Moroccan parents, has been obsessed with the Atlas Lions since he saw them on the front page of French newspapers – his parents told me. He wore his Morocco jersey to school on match days and has decided Hakim Ziyech is his favourite player because he was “also born in Europe”. .His parents said this is the first time he has shown such a strong interest in his Moroccan heritage. Adam spent hours memorising the Moroccan national anthem, and feels proud and connected to Morocco in a way he has never felt before. .But beyond instilling pride in our Moroccan identity, the Atlas Lions have also united us. They have shown us that diversity is strength, not an obstacle. More than half of the Moroccan squad were also born in Europe, and they have the same cultural and linguistic diversity as our communities. .While a national language is seen as a key identity marker and the glue of most national squads, the Moroccan team has demonstrated that cohesion can transcend language and be built on dedication and pride. Witnessing the Moroccan players fight till the last minute to bring success to their country and embodying a whole spectrum of “tamghrabiyt” – the cultural term for Moroccanness – has inspired us to proudly call ourselves Moroccan no matter where we were born or what language we speak. .When asked about representing the Arab world in the World Cup, Walid Regragui, the Moroccan head coach, cemented our intersectional identity by emphasising that the squad is playing for Morocco and for Africa. This was an important public assertion that Morocco is a culturally heterogeneous country that cannot be reduced to the Arab part of its identity. .The Atlas Lions reminded us that Moroccanness truly encompasses linguistic and cultural diversity. They have given us hope that we can identify as Moroccan and European, and that we do not have to give up on one or the other. They have dared us to dream of a Europe where multiculturalism is not just accepted but embraced. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",60
61,Published On 20 Dec 2022,Argentinians ecstatic as World Cup winners return for parade,Lionel Messi posts photo of him sleeping with World Cup trophy ahead of celebration that draws hundreds of thousands of Argentines.,".Hundreds of thousands – millions by some estimates – of Argentines dance, cry and cheer, flooding onto the streets of Buenos Aires on Tuesday to celebrate the country’s World Cup-winning football squad led by Lionel Messi after their plane landed in the pre-dawn hours. .The team arrived in the early hours at Ezeiza airport where despite it being about 3am (06:00 GMT) thousands were waiting with banners, flags and flares, and howling in joy after 36 years since the country’s last World Cup victory. .By about midday, hundreds of thousands had congregated in downtown Buenos Aires, with major roads shut down for the parade. People held up banners of Messi and late icon Diego Maradona, played instruments or climbed lampposts or bus stops. .“It’s crazy, it’s incredible, it’s the best thing that can happen to you in life,” said Matias Gomez, 25, a metalworker. .“It is an enormous joy to see all these happy people, all together, one with the other, holding hands, giving each other hugs, kisses. We are all one today.” .The Argentinian capital has been in party mode since the dramatic victory over France in Sunday’s final in Qatar, which has helped mask economic woes in the South American nation battling one of the world’s highest inflation rates. .The victory, in a penalty shootout after a whipsaw game, made the country world champions for the first time since Diego Maradona hoisted the trophy in 1986 and the third in total. The government made Tuesday a national holiday to allow fans to celebrate the win. .The players, after spending a few hours at the Argentinian Football Association (AFA) facilities near the airport, left on an open-top bus with signs saying “World Champions” and three stars to mark the country’s trio of trophies. .The players danced and cheered with fans who circled the bus. Police were having to hold people back to allow the vehicle to move forward on its slow journey towards the centre of town. .Earlier Messi, 35, who has burnished his reputation as one of the world’s greatest players, sent out a message on Instagram saying “Good morning!” with a photo of him sleeping in his room at the AFA complex next to the golden trophy. .Messi has said the final, in which Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties after the scintillating extra time ended with 3-3, would be his last match in the World Cup, though he intends to play a few more games for the national side. .At times, it has felt that the whole country has been partying through the night from Sunday onwards in the southern hemisphere summer, the joy of victory infecting everyone with cars regularly blaring their horns in celebration.",61
62,Published On 20 Dec 2022,Why Qatar 2022 was also Africa’s World Cup,"Tournament was an indication of continent’s growth in global game, with Morocco’s run crowning impressive displays by African teams.",".On Sunday night, inside Lusail Stadium, Lionel Messi finally completed the gauntlet of football and, in doing so, delivered Argentina’s first World Cup victory in 36 years. .However, that was not the only story of triumph to tell about the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. .Enter Morocco. .The Atlas Lions may have fallen short of a podium finish but, in reaching the last four, they went farther than any African nation had ever managed and won the hearts of millions around the continent and beyond. And in the process, they proved they can go toe to toe with any top opponent. .“African teams no longer fear that other teams can run them over,” Radhi Jaidi, former Tunisia international and Esperance manager, told Al Jazeera. .Twelve years after South Africa became the first country from the continent to host the World Cup, it is entirely justified to brand Qatar 2022 also as Africa’s World Cup, all things considered. .On the field, the continent posted its best-ever statistical performance, with every African team recording a victory, including Cameroon stunning Brazil, Tunisia beating France and Morocco defeating Belgium. And off the field, African teams’ supporters also stole the show – from the relentless drumming and dancing of the Senegal and Ghana contingent to the thunderous chanting and clapping of their Morocco and Tunisia counterparts. .And there was more: For the first time, all five representatives from the continent were led by local managers. .While the link could be seen by some as coincidental, the contrast between this tournament and the 2018 edition – in which two of the five teams were managed by African coaches, but none made it past the group stage, and between them, won just three matches in total – is impossible to ignore. . .For a continent that, over the years, has made a habit of paying handsome sums to expatriates on short-term contracts, the achievement of Morocco’s Walid Regragui could lead to an awakening. .“The success of Morocco is very important for the continent and other local coaches, too,” Jaidi said. .“It’s a great message to have a local manager succeed,” he said, adding that qualified homegrown coaches should be allowed to compete at the highest level,” he added. .“Employing a foreign coach is always seen as an opportunity by those in charge at the federations to sell the narrative that they’ve appointed someone advanced who will take the nation to the next level.” .While Jaidi is eager that African coaches to be afforded more trust, he also believed they must raise their level by obtaining the required qualifications and exposure. .“African coaches must strive to be the best in modern football, be the ones to help the players progress to the next level, but before they get a chance to work with the players they need to progress themselves. They must learn how modern football works, because it’s not just tactics on the pitch but a lot of other aspects.” .With Qatar 2022 already in the past, attention will now shift to whether African teams can build on their Qatar performances in the next edition of the tournament, which will be contested by 48 teams. .The expansion means the continent will have at least nine teams playing at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, with the possibility of a 10th representative should an African team make it through an intercontinental playoff. .This presents both a challenge and an opportunity, as historically Africa has suffered from under-representation on the global stage. .“Tournaments like the World Cup are very competitive and big, but if things are put in place and players arrive in the tournament in great conditions, I think Africa can make a great impact,” former Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa coach Philippe Troussier told Al Jazeera. .“Morocco have challenged other African countries to fight for the trophy instead of trying to celebrate small progress. This will change the face of African football and teams forever.” .While African teams’ successes in Qatar suggest there is scope for improvement in North America in 2026, Jaidi insists there is still work to do if the continent is to deliver on its potential. .“We all need to learn from what Morocco did to get to this level,” he said, citing among others the North African nation’s commitment to developing local coaches – 20 of the 23 recipients of the inaugural Confederation of African Football Pro Licence coaching diploma in June were Moroccan. .Continued Jaidi, “Providing great infrastructures around the clubs and national level to get to where they are now, a great federation, one of the world’s best training centres of football, scouting of local and diaspora talents. .“Their success is not by chance or accidental, it’s been planned and programmed and part of the result is the success in Qatar – and they continue to build on this.” .Former Wolves and Nigeria midfielder Seyi Olofinjana, who recently held the technical director role at Swiss club Grasshopper Zurich, was of the same view. .“There needs to be a way, desire and deliberate plan on the part of the federations that is then disseminated to the players,” he told Al Jazeera. “Morocco was a joy to watch because they’ve managed to merge their plans with a proven manager and players ready to play without lacking the overall knowledge of the collective goal.” .Another likely factor in Africa’s unprecedented success in the Middle East was the composition of their squads. More than 40 percent of the players named as part of the rosters of the five representatives were born outside Africa, a factor which Jaidi believed played a part in levelling the playing field in Qatar. .For Troussier, the fact that African teams featured a number of foreign-born players was also advantageous. .“Most of these players are educated from the beginning; a player born in Germany, France, Italy and in the Netherlands, they play automatically at a different level, they share time with high-level coaches, high-level players, technical programmes and automatically when they come back to the country, they bring a strong experience,” he said. .The Frenchman, however, stressed that local growth should not be neglected. .“These players will help improve the team, but the federations must also prepare, develop a programme and strategy that can help improve the country’s football,” he said. .It is this merging of approaches that Morocco – whose World Cup squad featured 14 players born outside the country – benefitted from, according to Olofinjana, .“It’s evident that there’s a culture of what it means to play for Morocco from the players, technical staff and even the supporters,” he said. “You could sense that there’s an element of what it meant to wear the Moroccan shirt. .“The country has created a sense of the importance of representing Morocco. Ahead of the coming World Cup, Morocco has shown the rest of Africa that it is very possible to reach the semifinals, and even the final of the tournament.”",62
63,Published On 20 Dec 2022,How Lionel Messi’s ‘bisht’ exposed Western media’s racism again,The Arab cloak was a sign of respect for Messi after his World Cup win. But ignorant newsrooms won’t understand that.,".On Sunday, billions of people collectively turned their gaze to the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, as Argentina were crowned World Cup champions after a sparkling final against France. .Yet instead of focusing on the majesty of the football the world had just witnessed, Western media opted to fixate on how the emir of Qatar draped Lionel Messi, the Argentine captain, in the traditional Arab cloak known as a “bisht”. .Reactions from several pundits and journalists have reflected the same racism and Islamophobia that have been prevalent throughout the tournament and in the years leading up to it. But they also underscore the lack of diversity that marks most Western newsrooms — which limits their ability to comprehend much of the world beyond stilted stereotypes. .“The bizarre act that ruined the greatest moment in World Cup history” read one, now redacted, the headline from British newspaper, The Telegraph. “Absolutely grim” declared the headline on Fox Sports, and “disgraceful” read Yahoo Sports. .Others opted for distinctly racist statements, with Mark Ogden, a senior ESPN journalist writing: “All the pics are ruined by somebody making him wear a cape that looks like he’s about to have a haircut”. Similarly, Dan Walker, a football television presenter wrote, in a now-deleted tweet, “I bet Mbappe is delighted he managed to swerve the weird mesh cloak with gold trim,” suggesting losing a World Cup final would have been better. .A bisht, also known as an aba or abaya in other Arab countries, is a garment symbolic of prestige, honour and stature. It is worn on special occasions and only by senior religious figures, political or tribal leaders, representing immense success. .The honour of wearing a bisht, especially if it is draped over you by a person of prestige – let alone by Qatar’s leader – is a rare privilege, a knighting or coronation in many ways. On Sunday, it added to the grandiosity of the occasion and was in recognition of what Messi has accomplished. .For this World Cup did not only represent Argentina’s victory. It also sealed Messi’s status in the eyes of many as the “GOAT” (greatest of all time) of football – above not just his peer Cristiano Ronaldo, but perhaps even the biggest former icons of the game such as Pele and Diego Maradona. He has now won every eminent trophy the sport has to offer, including seven Ballon D’Or titles – awarded to the best player annually. .Now, I do understand that since childhood it has been Messi’s dream to play for Argentina. Part of that dream likely included the hope of one day lifting the solid gold World Cup trophy in an Argentina jersey like Maradona before him. It is reasonable to wonder whether Messi’s wishes were overtaken by events on stage. But the Western media outrage is not about Messi’s dream. It is about an unwillingness, steeped in racism and Orientalism, to accept that football and celebrations can look different in different parts of the world. .At no point did Messi appear to show disdain for the bisht. Nor was his number 10 Argentina shirt – a jersey so iconic it sold out globally ahead of the final – covered beyond recognition. .It is not uncommon for victorious athletes to be given gifts or items of clothing reflective of local cultures. The aptest example is Pele’s 1970 World Cup victory in Mexico, where a sombrero was placed on his head. Was Pele’s moment “hijacked”, as Australia’s 7 News claimed happened in the case of Messi? .Indeed, from the day Qatar was awarded the right to host the World Cup, Western outlets have displayed their “shock”. Eurocentric and hypocritical objections persisted in the build-up to the epochal tournament and continued through it. The outrage over Messi’s bisht was one last show of ignorance. .The Moroccan national team’s success in the World Cup represented pride for many Arabs and Africans around the world. For me, as an Iraqi Arab, it was truly inspiring to see the triumph of another Arab nation and to witness their culturally similar celebrations. But, like with the bisht, Western media once again displayed anti-Arab ignorance after Morocco’s series of shock victories. .After they eventually bowed out to France in the semi-finals, ESPN posted a photograph of the Moroccan players in prostration, a symbol of humility to God for billions of Muslims around the world. But the caption read: “Moroccan players and staff bow in appreciation to their supporters that came out in force”. .A German news outlet, Welt, compared Moroccan players celebrating by pointing one finger towards the sky to ISIL (ISIS) fighters. No Western outlet draws such parallels for Messi when he celebrates by pointing his fingers towards the sky after scoring goals. The affectionate images of Moroccan players celebrating with their mothers, a reflection of the importance of family in African and Arab cultures, were mocked by a Danish television channel: The Moroccans were compared with a family of monkeys. .Yet such racism, ignorance and outright incompetence in journalism are not entirely surprising given the lack of representation in most Western newsrooms. In the United States, 40 percent of the population is not white. But a 2020 Reuters Institute study found that nearly 90 percent of top editors are white. Improving diversity at senior levels in newsrooms will help Western media outlets build safeguards against displays of ignorance — though that would need these organisations to accept their failure in dismantling barriers to growth for non-white journalists. .In the Arab world, some are excitedly calling the bisht-wearing Argentine captain “Sheikh Messi”. That too is a reflection of the affection he enjoys. Let us not taint his – and Argentina’s – glorious victory with a racist furore over a gesture of admiration and respect. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",63
64,Published On 19 Dec 2022,Staff picks: My favourite World Cup 2022 moment,"From Morocco’s fairy-tale journey to Japan fans cleaning up after the match, here are a few highlights of World Cup in Qatar.",".The World Cup came and went. .Argentina beat France in a pulsating final on Sunday to close the chapter on the Arab world’s first football World Cup. .With plenty of on- and off-field action to choose from, here are some of the moments of the World Cup as seen by some of Al Jazeera’s staff covering the tournament. .Showkat Shafi – Photojournalist .Tracking Morocco’s phenomenal journey was special. Among my most cherished moments during the coverage was watching a son on a video call with his father back home when Morocco beat Spain. Both of them were crying and screaming in a moment of pure joy and love for the game. The young man was moving his phone to make sure his father in Morocco was part of the historic moment. I also witnessed the fact that for many football devotees, the World Cup is almost a spiritual gathering. .After Lionel Messi lifted the cup and paraded it across the ground, many Argentinian fans in the crowd requested security personnel and photographers, including me, to pluck a few strands of grass from the ground where Argentina made history. .Sandra Gathmann – Host: Start Here .A highlight of the World Cup was seeing Japan beat Germany and being able to show the world there is more to why Japanese fans clean up the stands after matches. I was born and raised in Osaka and my producer Adele-Momoko Fraser is half Japanese. When videos of Japanese fans cleaning up started making rounds, we set out to explain that cleaning up after yourself is “atarimae” (obvious) and that it comes down to a level of respect and sportsmanship that extends to how players treat each other on the pitch too. .Hafsa Adil – Contributing journalist .For me, it was having the opportunity to mingle with football fans from across the world, especially the ones from Argentina. .From taking out massive loans to selling their cars and leaving behind their newborns for a chance to see their team lift the trophy, Argentinian football fans redefined football fanaticism for me. The self-confessed “crazy” fans not only put everything on the line to be in Qatar, but most of the 35,000 or so of them also made it their home. .They gleefully invited every Lionel Messi fan to walk into their homes in Barwagento, share a piece of their succulent barbecue, and sing along to Muchachos with them. It has been an education in football fandom. .Usaid Siddiqui – Journalist .It was watching the opening ceremony and the opening game with thousands of migrant workers at the Industrial Area Fan Zone. They seemed to be having a great time away from very gruelling work schedules to enjoy the football. After all, these people made the World Cup happen and made Qatar the way it is. .In the stadium, it was definitely the atmosphere of the Morocco-Portugal quarterfinal. I remember how a woman kept pacing some 20 metres away from her seat, unable to watch the game, profusely praying for an Atlas Lions win. And her prayers were answered. .Faras Ghani – Editor .My favourite moment of the World Cup came at the very end: Lionel Messi lifting the trophy. This was not because of Messi or because it was Argentina winning the tournament. It was because at that moment it hit me that Qatar had done it. Twelve years in the making, it withstood 12 years of criticism, hate, racism and allegations of corruption, hate and racism and managed to deliver what it promised. .The journey was not smooth or perfect due to the spotlight over its treatment of migrant workers and the kafala system. While the situation on the ground has improved in the last few years, there still is room for further improvement. Qatar’s promises to those who come to its shores to provide a better life for their families are hopefully kept as this is the country’s chance to pay back those who helped it reach those very heights seen during the World Cup.",64
65,Published On 19 Dec 2022,Analysis: Six key takeaways from the Qatar World Cup,"From the end of the Messi saga to the first Arab tournament, and the mixing of politics and sports – here’s what FIFA, and the rest of us, will have to think about.",".A World Cup like no other wraps up with a final like no other, a footballing story for the ages and the first tournament for a region often only talked about in the negative. What have we learned? What has FIFA learned? What has football learned? Here are my key takeaways from the last month: .Or one of the three greatest, at least, alongside his fellow Argentinian Diego Maradona and the Brazilian Pele. A scriptwriter could not have come up with a better story – or a better conclusion. The sporting troubles the Argentinian genius has had to overcome, the loss in the 2014 World Cup final, the sense that Argentina had never fully taken to him as they had to Maradona. .Then, the redemption. The transformation of Messi in the past few years into the leader of this team, the pilgrimage of tens of thousands of Argentinians halfway across the world to Doha, and the sense of the inevitable as the tournament progressed. And yet, in those closing minutes of regular time on Sunday, Argentina collapsed. They appeared poised to steal defeat from the jaws of victory, only to somehow emerge victorious. One of the sport’s greatest-ever players fulfilled his destiny in the World Cup’s greatest-ever final. . .The questions over whether Qatar had the footballing gravitas and tradition to hold the World Cup are well-trodden now. .However, the message the Qataris tried to put forward from the start was that this would be a regional tournament and one that would represent the whole Arab world. .Regional differences, particularly the blockade of Qatar, dampened that narrative initially. But the rapprochement between Qatar and its neighbours, as well as the fact that Doha is truly an international city, with people from across the Arab world, Asia, Africa and yes, Europe, calling it home, meant that the fears over a lack of atmosphere were always overblown. There was never going to be any need for “fake fans”, despite the attempts by some reputable media organisations to frame fans from South Asia as such. .Other concerns, such as the lack of alcohol at games, also reflected a particular Western view on how football should be enjoyed, ignoring that, for many people, including women and families, the lack of free-flowing beer made match attendance a lot more enjoyable, and safe. .So was the fear-mongering warranted? And if it was not, do the people and organisations who participated in it have questions to answer about their own motives in framing it that way? .Qatar won the right to host the tournament, and the rest of the region embraced the event as their own. Why couldn’t everyone else accept that? .Football is a global sport, but its culture has long been dominated by Europe, and to a lesser extent, South America. .Having the World Cup in the Middle East allowed people from the region to have a tournament which they could attend and not feel foreign. It allowed people who simply would not have been able to travel to the West for a World Cup – for financial, cultural, or visa reasons – to witness the sport’s marquee event. .And they did. Moroccan and Saudi fans lit up this tournament in a way that simply could not have happened elsewhere. There were significant contingents from Africa and Asia, too. When will we be able to see this many Indian fans at a World Cup again? .For one month, Doha turned into a meeting place for the world. Japanese and Saudis sat at food courts together, and Mexicans chanted with Ghanaians and people from the United States. Argentinians arrived on what must have felt like a shared national adventure, to a faraway land, and took it in their stride. .European fans, of course, did not travel in their usual numbers. That is a shame: Their presence would have been the icing on the cake of what has been a great tournament. .The experience at this World Cup was, I’m sure, different for diverse sets of fans. Some people will have preferred elements of this tournament to previous ones. Others may have liked earlier editions better. We are all different, with different opinions, different preferences and different values. .No one size fits all. Normal for some is abnormal for others. And that is the point: A truly global game must embrace differences. . .Led by a charge from Africa and spirited performances from Asian and North American teams, football’s traditional elite has been challenged in recent years. .But this tournament truly felt like a signpost. .Morocco became the first African and Arab team to reach a World Cup semifinal, and were, along with Messi, the story of the tournament. Being inside a stadium with their fans was a highlight of the tournament for many people. Their players shone, but they were not a team of plucky upstarts. This is a team that included Achraf Hakimi of Paris Saint-Germain, Hakim Ziyech of Chelsea and Yassine Bounou of Sevilla. .Every African team won a game, including against Brazil, France and Belgium. Japan beat Germany and Spain. South Korea beat Portugal. Argentina had a winning streak going back to 2019 broken by Saudi Arabia. .This is how it should be, and how, inevitably, it will continue. A truly world game, where anyone can win. .In the run-up to the World Cup, Qatar was criticised for its treatment of migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people. The debate over these issues highlights the difficulties governing body FIFA has going forward if it wants to continue its policy of trying to globalise football. .Qatar has acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms, following reports of the deaths of labourers working on World Cup infrastructure and mistreatment. It says that changes have been made, and will continue to be, particularly when it comes to safety. .But many people in Qatar, the wider region and beyond felt that the concerns raised in the West reeked of hypocrisy, Orientalist stereotypes or outright racism. .No previous host has faced the scrutiny Qatar has, including Russia, which was bombing Syria and invading Ukraine in the run-up to hosting the last World Cup. .But therein lies the problem for FIFA. Where is the line on human rights? Who gets to determine it? And by what standards? “Universal” human rights in the Western sense are oftentimes not accepted elsewhere. Does that automatically rule out most of the world from hosting what is supposed to be a global game? .What about the human rights of Palestinians, whose flag was a prominent presence in Qatar in ways that might not have been possible at other tournaments? .As the primary host of the next World Cup, will the US now face extra criticisms of its domestic and foreign policies? .It would be great for FIFA if the World Cup could travel around the world every four years and yet simultaneously take place in a magical and sanitised “FIFAland”, where none of these issues exist. .Unfortunately for them, the World Cup takes place in the real world – and that means questions over how such global sporting events should handle politics are not going to go away. .Among the secondary criticisms of this tournament were the changes that it forced upon the traditional footballing calendar, and the logistical capacity of the host to pull off sport’s biggest spectacle. .Once it became clear that it would be far too hot to host a sporting tournament in the Gulf summer, the call was made to move it to the winter – bang in the middle of the European footballing calendar. .Yet, while this did disrupt the club season, fears that this would hurt the tournament never made sense: A mid-season World Cup would surely mean fitter players and therefore better games. .Qatar is indeed the smallest country to have hosted the World Cup. But worries that the country wouldn’t be able to host millions of extra guests all at once have by and large not been realised. .None of this means that a winter World Cup is necessarily better than a summer tournament. .But the dam has broken. It’s now clear that breaking tradition does not necessarily break the sport or the event, and it will be far easier for FIFA to make changes in the future.",65
66,Published On 18 Dec 2022,‘Maradona is guiding us’: Argentina fans on World Cup 2022 final,Argentina fans are seeking inspiration from the late Diego Maradona as they hope their team can repeat his 1986 magic.,".Doha, Qatar – For George Matus, a 55-year-old Argentina fan from Buenos Aires, Diego Maradona is a god who now sits in the heavens above, and Lionel Messi is his messiah on the football pitch. .It has been 36 years since Argentina last won the football World Cup, but the magic of 1986 lives on in the memories of Matus and his compatriots. .“When I think about that day in Mexico City, I get goosebumps, and my heart starts beating in my mouth,” Matus told Al Jazeera from the Argentine fan village in Qatar. .As Argentina take on France in the final on Sunday, two years on from Maradona’s death, fans expect their icon to be the guiding light from up above. .“When Maradona scored against England in the quarterfinal in 1986, he called it the hand of God, and now, he is the hand of God guiding Argentina all the way to glory,” Sebas, a Germany-based Argentina fan said while referring to Maradona’s famous first goal in the match against England. .That game was played four years after the Falklands War between Argentina and Britain. Maradona’s second goal in that match is widely considered one of the greatest ever: He took possession of the ball in Argentina’s half, then dribbled past a series of England players and their goalkeeper to score, leaving opposition players on their knees or with hands on hips. .Many years later, Maradona termed the victory a “revenge” for the war in his autobiography, I am The Diego. .Matus, who attended the 1986 World Cup as a 19-year-old, said Maradona did more than just win a trophy for the country. “I saw him weave his magic on the pitch, but his real power was in uniting the nation after the [Falklands] war,” Matus said with a quivering voice. .According to Matus, Maradona was a leader of the entire nation and united all Argentinians after years of economic struggle, military dictatorship and societal discord. .“He invoked a sense of pride in being Argentinian that we had forgotten, and he is the reason this blue and white shirt became so popular,” Matus said while pointing to a sea of Argentine shirts in the crowd in front of him. .For most fans who have travelled to Qatar, the love and reverence for Maradona have been passed on from the previous generations. .Mauro, who has travelled from Cordoba in central Argentina, has been wearing a worn-out Maradona shirt to every match in Qatar. “My father bought it during the 1986 World Cup and passed it on to me,” he said. “Along with the shirt, my father passed on his love for Diego and taught me that Maradona fought for all the unfortunate people in the world.” .Every time fans make their way to an Argentina match, Maradona’s name is on their lips when they sing their football anthems, his face is emblazoned on their banners, and his number is printed on their shirts. .“He’s in our hearts, our soul, our blood,” Matus said while patting his chest, and added: “Maradona is Argentina, and Argentina is Maradona.”",66
67,Published On 18 Dec 2022,‘We’re going to win’: Argentina waits in hope for World Cup title,A nation battered by crises is coming together to cheer for Argentina as they face France in Sunday’s World Cup final.,".Buenos Aires, Argentina – A day before kickoff for the World Cup final in Qatar, Mayerlin Díaz Iglesias and her eight-year-old son Jose Alberto took a selfie in the heart of Buenos Aires. .Decked out in Lionel Messi jerseys on Saturday afternoon, they were standing before the soaring Obelisco de Buenos Aires, a monument that – since it was erected in 1936 – has stood as a national symbol of Argentina’s greatest successes. .In this football-obsessed nation, that has often meant the country’s wins on the pitch. If the Albiceleste end up beating France in the World Cup final in Qatar on Sunday, tens of thousands of Argentines will flood the Avenida 9 de Julio – where the monument sits – as is the tradition, dancing to bongos, car horns and anthems they have been belting out for weeks. .“We’re here because Argentina is going to win,” said a confident Iglesias, 46, holding her infant daughter, also dressed in Messi gear. “We know that it’s going to be a huge party.” .Argentina has been vibrating with this kind of energy ever since it beat Croatia in the semifinal last week and earned a berth in the final at Lusail Stadium against Les Bleus, as the French side are known. .Few places on earth are as fixated on football as this country of 47 million people. The sport is part of its cultural identity: It’s a calling card around the globe; a way to measure greatness in the midst of chronic economic crisis; a fountain of joy and talent. .Jose Alberto, Iglesias’ son who is only two World Cups old himself, already knows how much the tournament means. One World Cup ends and the countdown to the next one begins, he said, standing in front of the obelisk. .Argentinian fans have had high expectations for the team led by superstar Messi, himself chasing the one trophy that has eluded him throughout his illustrious career. After a shocking opening loss to Saudi Arabia, the maestro went back to conducting a symphony on the pitch. And with every victory, every step closer to the goal, the crowd at home revelled in the splendour they saw on television – and for those who went to Qatar, in the flesh. .Now, hours away from the final match, the excitement and tension are at a fever pitch. .“Maradona, Maradona, Maradona sells,” said a merchant on Corrientes Avenue, the city’s theatre district, hawking jerseys that seem to be in endless supply. “If you’re younger, you look for Messi,” she added, or Julian Alvarez, the 22-year-old striker who emerged as a star during the tournament with four goals so far. .“That passion, that communion, that thing of celebrating the goal with the person that you have beside you, even though you don’t know who they are, or what they think, or where they come from,” said Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta. “We’re all together behind the same passion.” .A grandmother who joined in raucous celebrations in a suburb of Buenos Aires has become an online celebrity, dubbed “Abuela lalalala”; while a still from video of Messi calling a Dutch player “fool” after the tense quarterfinal against the Netherlands soon graced t-shirts sold at street corners. .On the streets, the enthusiasm is infectious, with people singing Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar (Guys, we’re excited again) a catchy song by La Mosca Tsé that has become the de facto Argentina World Cup anthem. .The city of Buenos Aires organised “banderazos” – events for people to cheer on the team, dance and wave their Argentina flags – at 15 points across the capital in the days before the final. The idea? Players more than 13,300km (8264 miles) away in Qatar should be able to hear the collective “scream” of the fans backing them. .The passion has also shows in superstitious rituals known as cabalas, in which people repeat a set of game-viewing behaviours that they’ve come to associate with victories. Fans have been watching games with the same people, sitting in the same seats, wearing the same clothes, and eating the same food – all meant to increase the chances of victory. .The World Cup has even summoned the sorcery of self-described witches in Argentina, who have banded together to use candles, orations and other rituals to send positive vibes in the direction of the team. They have also warned against practices that are meant to interfere with the French players, saying those could backfire on Argentina. .“It’s incredible to see what Argentina generates during the World Cup,” said Miguel Angel Bogado Gomez, who was selling World Cup souvenirs next to the obelisk. “Even Brazil, which has an incredibly high level of football, doesn’t end up doing what Argentina can on an international level with a ball and its jersey.” Even that hyperbole – Brazil have won five world Cups to Argentina’s two – only underscores the near-mythical status Argentina’s football players enjoy. .The 56-year-old craftsman, who sells his woodburning art, had a selection of Maradona- and Messi-themed art pieces. At his age, Gomez said, he has come to understand that “not everything turns out the way you want” but he’s so invested in this World Cup that the thought of having victory slip out of the team’s grasp filled him with anxiety. “At this time tomorrow, we could be champions,” he said. .Iglesias and Jose Alberto are convinced too. She described the World Cup as a “joyful” month that “brings unity” that she has seen through the messages she exchanged with friends and family in other parts of Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where she is originally from. Support for the Argentina squad has spread across the region, with people in Chile, Colombia, and even Brazil – a football rival – pulling for the team that’s representing South America in the final. .“I’ve carried Argentina in my blood for a long time, since I was young in Venezuela, and my dream of coming to live here came true,” she said. “The faith I’ve had with football, I’ve always had with Messi.” .For Elias Draganczuk, 38, the World Cup has been a distraction for a country ravaged by high inflation and seemingly endless economic gloom. “This is the opium of the village,” he said, looking out from a shaded perch near the obelisk. “Every four years to spend millions and millions on this when this is a country that doesn’t have potable water [in some parts],” he said, shaking his head. .Even though he hasn’t surrendered to football fever, he knows where his allegiance lies. “I’m Argentinian,” he said with a laugh. “Obviously I want them to win.”",67
68,Published On 18 Dec 2022,Mbappe vs Messi: Winner takes all at World Cup 2022,France can win the World Cup even if Mbappe is kept quiet. Argentina have no hope of winning if Messi doesn’t turn up.,".The sound of the final whistle had not even reached the upper tiers of Al Bayt Stadium on Wednesday by the time the World Cup final had received its billing. .It was not France vs Argentina, but a number 10 versus number 10; Paris Saint-Germain teammates tied for the Golden Boot; one approaching the end of his extended reign over football versus one who already has one hand on his throne; a man desperately vying for World Cup glory versus a boy who could end up a two-time world champion by the age of 23. .It is Lionel Messi versus Kylian Mbappe. .But if you blank out the noise, you will notice that there is more nuance to the narrative. .Mbappe and Messi are the obvious figureheads of their teams but the personas they have adopted at this World Cup are contrasting. .For Mbappe, the 2018 World Cup win projected him into superstardom and made him untouchable in the eyes of the French. But his transfer saga involving Real Madrid, coupled with acts of petulance despite signing a mega-contract at PSG, lowered the stead he was held in. .“He is still very much well-liked but I would say the perception has changed a little bit along with his status as one of the world’s best footballers. Somebody who is incredibly driven by team goals, but by personal goals as well,” said Matt Spiro, author of Sacre Bleu: Zidane to Mbappé – A Football Journey. .“I don’t think he’s the easiest guy to integrate in a collective.” .The focus on the collective is a key tenet of French manager Didier Deschamps’s philosophy. In the past year, squad harmony has been at its lowest since he took over in 2012. .Ahead of the Euros last year, Mbappe had a public falling out with Olivier Giroud after the AC Milan striker suggested Mbappe did not pass to him. There were reports of infighting following the team’s exit to Switzerland at the tournament. Since March this year, Mbappe has been at loggerheads with the French Association over image rights and in September refused to participate in a team photoshoot for the same reason. .An image has been formed of a supremely talented player who, to his detriment, was aware of how supremely talented he is. .The spate of injuries to key players furthered the belief that this France side was ripe for implosion. But the remarkable thing about their World Cup campaign is not the manner in which they have digested these setbacks or even the way they’ve eased into the final without ever hitting second gear. . .The quiet around the camp is what has been most impressive. There is a machine-like nature to their performances and the players all seem to be running on silent autopilot. .It is something Mbappe has bought in with vigour. He made a decision to not talk to the press during the tournament and agreed to pay the fine for missing the news conference that is requisite for players. .He did not want anything to distract him from football. What brought this on? Spiro believes the key to this is Deschamps. .“Mbappe has enormous respect for Deschamps, everyone does in France. There is one clear boss in the French national team and that’s not the case with PSG and hasn’t been the case for quite some years,” he said. .“It’s a different dynamic and Deschamps wouldn’t hesitate to leave Mbappe out or move him to a different position if he thought that was better for the team and that’s not always the case at PSG.” .Mbappe also appears to have recognised that to enhance his legacy at tournaments like the World Cup, the strength of the collective is key. To do that, compromise is required. He may be the crown jewel of this French side but his shine is no longer blinding for his colleagues. .While Mbappe has needed to buckle down and come to terms with being one of the 11, Messi needs to transcend being just a teammate. Belatedly perhaps, he has recognised that for the Albiceleste, he needs to be the spiritual leader. .He has expressed as much emotion in the past month as he has perhaps in the rest of his career. But, it feels strangely necessary for Messi to wear his heart on his sleeve if Argentina are to have any chance of winning. .Louis van Gaal’s remarks about how the Netherlands stymied Messi in the 2014 World Cup semifinal were taken as a sign of disrespect and used to fuel the fire of the team. Yes, the heckling of Wout Weghorst and the pointed celebrations in van Gaal’s direction felt uncharacteristic. But perhaps it was just him letting off steam. .While Mbappe has shunned the media, Messi has embraced it. He was the only player from the Argentina side to front up to the media after their loss to Saudi Arabia. Following the win over Mexico, he spoke of the “long days” that followed their loss in the opening game and how a new World Cup starts for them. .Before the semifinal, he spoke of Diego Maradona. .“Diego is watching us from heaven. He is pushing us and I really hope this stays the way until the end,” he said. .The squad seems to have wholeheartedly embraced the narrative of it being Messi’s last chance to win the World Cup. It has given the team purpose. There is single-mindedness in their efforts to help him win the World Cup. .On the pitch too, Messi binds this team together: He is the chief orchestrator, making the opposition dance to his tune and teammates move to his rhythms. He has been involved in nine of the 12 goals they have scored so far. He simplifies the task of the midfielders by taking away creative responsibility and allows them to focus on their primary task – shielding him. .He feeds on the loose balls and serves them on platters for the strikers. .The captain has been better than the team at this World Cup. It is an important distinction to make. Messi has been otherworldly so far in the tournament. .And therein lies a key difference between Messi and Mbappe. France can win the World Cup even if Mbappe is kept quiet. Argentina have no hope of winning if Messi does not turn up.",68

71,Published On 14 Dec 2022,"For African fans, legendary Morocco feat means ‘sky is the limit’",Supporters from countries across the continent say Atlas Lions’ run in Qatar proves that African teams belong to elite of the game.,".Al Khor, Qatar – They came from far and wide to be part of history: For the first time, a football team from their continent, Africa, was playing in a World Cup semifinal. .“What I have witnessed tonight will be with me for the rest of my life,” said Joseph Kithitu, a doctor who travelled from Kenya to Al Khor, a coastal town in northern Qatar, to watch Morocco take on reigning world champions France on Wednesday. .Despite a spirited performance that saw them dominate ball possession and create a string of chances, Morocco lost 2-0 to goals by France’s Theo Hernandez and Randal Kolo Muani. .“Morocco have made me proud. Morocco have made the African continent really proud,” said Kithitu. “They lost tonight but in my eyes they are winners.” .The achievement of the team nicknamed the Atlas Lions was not lost on the spectators who packed the almost 69,000-capacity Al Bayt Stadium, the vast majority of whom were Morocco supporters. .The North African side was only the third from outside Europe or South America to reach a World Cup semifinal – the first was the USA at the inaugural World Cup held in Uruguay in 1930, followed by South Korea on home soil in 2002. .Kithitu, who brought his son with him to the World Cup in Qatar, said Morocco had shown the world African teams belong to the elite of the game. .“That we can go toe to toe with any team, anywhere and at any time. Next time, we will go all the way,” he predicted. .Morocco’s fairytale run was no walk in the park. In their opening match, they faced 2018 runners-up Croatia whom they held to a goalless draw. .The Atlas Lions then bulldozed the Red Devils of Belgium, ranked second in the world pre-tournament. The star-studded Belgium team, like others throughout the tournament, were unable to unlock Morocco’s backline and ended up losing 2-0. .Morocco then made relatively easy work of Canada, defeating them 2-1, before beating 2010 world champions Spain on penalties in the Round of 16. .In the quarterfinal, Morocco overcame Portugal 1-0 to book a date with two-time champions France. .Morocco, also the first team from an Arab country to reach the last four, became the 25th side to compete in the semifinals of the World Cup. All the other teams to reach the last four had reached the semifinal stage before, with France and Argentina having both won the tournament twice and Croatia coming second in the previous tournament in Russia. .“African football has arrived. We are here and we belong here. We beat the biggest teams in Europe to get here,” said Zik Tuma, a Ugandan who travelled from Malta for the showpiece. .“The future of African football is very bright. Our football future has never been better and more promising than now. Those who doubted us can now see our achievements,” he added. .“The sky is the limit.” .His comments echoed those of Morocco coach Walid Regragui, who said after the December 10 triumph over Portugal that Africa was “back on the map of football today”. .“We had the right attitude for our people, for us, for Africa,” Regragui, the first African coach to take a team into the World Cup quarter-finals, had told reporters. .“It is always difficult for us African coaches. You don’t think we can handle such teams tactically.” .His well-organised team’s feats on the pitch came to crown a series of impressive displays by African teams in Qatar: Cameroon became the first African team to beat five-time champions Brazil, while Senegal overcame the loss to injury of their superstar forward Sadio Mane to reach the Round of 16. Tunisia, meanwhile, held Denmark to a goalless draw and also beat France 1-0 in the group stage’s final match. .Supporter Ali Mohammad, who travelled from Sudan’s capital Khartoum to attend the first World Cup held in the Middle East, said: “Africa deserved this moment”. .“I’m very happy. We have been waiting for this for a very long time,” he added. “Yes, Morocco lost but not many countries can even dream of their achievement,” Mohammad said, noting that the Atlas Lions’ feat was celebrated across the continent. .Following the end of Morocco’s run in the tournament, African supporters in Al Khor called on the world football’s governing body, FIFA, to award the continent more places in the competition, which in its 2022 edition featured 32 teams. .“Africa is 54 countries and we only receive five places. It is time FIFA changed that. It is obvious from how Morocco played and beat all these big teams that our continent is as good as any other. We need to get our fair share of places,” said Akusa, Tuma’s wife. .Morocco will now face Croatia on Saturday in the third-place playoff at Khalifa International Stadium in Doha. .“They are legends. They are in our history books,” Mohammad said. “They will forever be in our hearts.”",71

73,Published On 14 Dec 2022,Recap: France vs Morocco – World Cup 2022,Defending world champions end Morocco’s World Cup dreams and book their place in the final.,".France have beaten Morocco 2-0 at Al Bayt Stadium to claim a place in Sunday’s World Cup final. .They will play Lionel Messi’s Argentina who booked their spot with Tuesday’s win over Croatia. .In an end-to-end game on Wednesday, the defending world champions took their chances but Morocco did not make life easy for France, with notable periods of attacking possession on either side of the halftime break. .Morocco pressed high early but left gaps at the back. When Antoine Griezmann found one such space in the fifth minute, Morocco panicked. His effort was blocked but it rebounded for Kylian Mbappe. Morocco franticly managed to get in the way of his effort too, but failed to control or clear it, and it bounced to Theo Hernandez. .Hernandez paused for a split-second, unhurried as the ball came to a striking height while goalkeeper Yassine Bounou was bearing down upon him, then leapt into the air and connected with the ball beautifully, sending it past the keeper and into the net. It was the first goal Morocco had conceded to an opposition player at the World Cup in Qatar. .Five minutes in and Morocco’s already tough job became even harder. .Azzedine Ounahi’s ninth-minute effort from 25 metres out forced a good save from a diving Hugo Lloris. Hakim Ziyech shot wide in the 15th minute after a sweet breakaway from Morocco’s box. .But then it was France’s chance to counter and Olivier Giroud smashed a shot into Morocco’s left upright. .With half an hour down, Morocco had another good spell of possession in front of France’s goal, but again Walid Regragui’s men could not find a way through France’s defence. With seven blue shirts in their own box at one point, not even Ziyech’s mazy back-and-forth probing run could amount to anything. .Just before halftime, a great delivery from the corner by Ziyech eventually came to Jawad El-Yamiq. El-Yamiq, back to goal, launched himself into the air, connecting for a spectacular overhead bicycle kick that forced Lloris to palm the shot onto the post. .Two minutes later and another corner for Ziyech. This was comfortably dealt with by Lloris but gave the Moroccans a sense of momentum. They were getting under the skin of the French, who promptly gave away two free kicks within striking distance. At the break, France were ahead but Morocco’s Atlas Lions were the ones roaring. .Abderrazak Hamdallah stopped twice as he neared France’s goal in the 74th minute, perhaps second-guessing himself on this huge occasion. Whatever the reason, it was one stop too many for Morocco’s best chance of several in the second half. .Kolo Muani, on the field for less than a minute, could not miss from two yards out. Mbappe managed to pick up a loose Moroccan pass in midfield, bringing it into a congested Moroccan box. His shot bounced off Abde Ezzalzouli into the path of Muani, who tapped it in. Game over.",73
74,Published On 14 Dec 2022,France seal World Cup final spot with 2-0 win over Morocco,Reigning world champions overcome spirited Atlas Lions display to set up showdown with Argentina on Sunday.,".France edged past Morocco during a frenetic semifinal clash to secure their place in Sunday’s World Cup final, with the reigning world champions holding off a spirited display from the North African side to win 2-0. .Left-back Theo Hernandez put France ahead after just five minutes at the Al Bayt Stadium on Wednesday, firing an acrobatic effort past Yassine Bounou from close range to become the first opposition player to score against the Atlas Lions in Qatar. .Morocco responded forcefully to the early setback, controlling the majority of possession and pressing for an equaliser on either side of half-time. .France, who for large periods were second-best, held out nonetheless and Randal Kolo Muani put the game to bed late, tapping home from close range in the 79th minute to set up a showdown with Argentina in four days’ time. .France are looking to become the first team to retain the World Cup title since Brazil in 1962. .Morocco, the first Arab and first African country to make it to a World Cup semifinal, will face Croatia in a third-place playoff on Saturday. .For the first goal, Hernandez had to lift his left foot high to connect with a bouncing ball from a tight angle to finish off a sweeping move started by Antoine Griezmann’s run down the right and a cutback pass that star French forward Kylian Mbappe initially fluffed. .Denting Morocco’s hopes further, captain Romain Saiss was forced off at the 20-minute mark with an injury, further disrupting a backline that had been shaken pre-match by the last-minute replacement of fellow centre back Nayef Aguerd with Achraf Dari. .Aguerd, who had been named in the starting lineup despite concerns over a hamstring injury sustained earlier in the tournament, was deemed unfit to take part in the match following Morocco’s warm-up. .Attempting to capitalise on the disruption, France striker Olivier Giroud struck the post and missed from point-blank range in the first half at the end of a barnstorming run through the middle from Aurelien Tchouameni. .The midfielder threaded a superb ball to find Mbappe, whose miscued shot was poorly cleared, allowing Giroud a first-time shot that was wide from close-in. .But Morocco were never overawed and had opportunities of their own as Azzedine Ounahi forced two good saves out of French captain Hugo Lloris with speculative efforts, and curling set-pieces put the French defence under pressure. .Replacement centre-back Jawad El Yamiq was, however, closest to an equaliser with a spectacular bicycle kick on the stroke of halftime, from a poorly cleared corner by the French, with Lloris getting a vital touch as it hit the base of the upright. .Morocco fans said they were proud of their side despite Wednesday’s loss and focused on the Atlas Lions’ historic showing in the tournament. .“We made history. The players have made us so proud of our country, we can never thank them enough,” Yassine Azami, 35, told Al Jazeera. .Azami, who was visiting Qatar from Tangier, added coach Walid Regragui and his side will be welcomed home with “open arms” in recognition of their “amazing achievements” when they eventually return to Morocco. .Fellow supporter Rahim Behraoui said the Atlas Lions’ efforts in Qatar showed the future was bright for a team that few would have highlighted as serious challengers for world football’s biggest prize before this year’s tournament kicked off. .“We were not the best team today. Congratulations to France,” Behraoui, 46, told Al Jazeera. .“The French were better than us in all areas … but no one can tell us we are not good enough to reach this stage. We showed with Spain, Portugal how good we are,” he added. .“Inshallah we will win this [the World Cup] … if not in four years, then maybe eight.” .Additional reporting by Al Jazeera’s Usaid Siddiqui at Al Bayt Stadium",74

RAM said it would reimburse air tickets and apologised to its customers. .Morocco have enjoyed significant support at the Qatar World Cup, both from the thousands of fans that have already travelled to the country, as well as from fans of other Arab nations and neutrals — especially from Asia and Africa. .The Atlas Lions have been the giant killers of the tournament so far, beating Belgium in the group stage and knocking out Spain and Portugal in the knockout stages. .After RAM promised more flights ahead of the semifinal, hundreds of fans in Morrocco had hoped to travel to Doha and obtain tickets on arrival. .Youssef Chippo, a former Moroccan national team player, working in Qatar as a commentator for BeIn sports channel, said the flight cancellations were linked to the arrival of many fans in Doha without match tickets. .There have been reports of minor scuffles between Moroccan fans and security officers on duty for the World Cup as ticketless supporters have tried to make their way to the matches. .At Doha airport, fans arriving overnight from Casablanca said they expected to receive tickets on arrival based on what they had read on social media and in the Moroccan press. “Ninety-five percent of people on the plane didn’t have a ticket,” said Mohammed, a Moroccan fan outside Al Janoub Stadium where the semifinal will be held. .A message posted by Hamad International Airport on Wednesday morning urged supporters “not to go to the two airports [of Doha] until they have obtained tickets for the upcoming matches”. .“We remind supporters that Hamad International Airport in Doha is not the official site for obtaining tickets for World Cup matches,” the message added.",75

Medical teams attended the scene and provided emergency treatment before he was transferred to hospital where he died on Tuesday, the statement added. .“We regret to announce that, despite the efforts of the medical team, he sadly passed away in hospital on Tuesday 13 December, after being in the intensive care unit for three days,” the statement said. .“His next of kin have been informed. We send our sincere condolences to his family, colleagues and friends during this difficult time.” . .The organisers said they are investigating the circumstances leading to the fall “as a matter of urgency” and would provide further information pending the outcome of the investigation. .“We will also ensure that his family receive all outstanding dues and monies owed,” the statement added. .Qatar launched a work safety investigation into the death of a Filipino worker last week after reports emerged that the man died while working at a training site for World Cup. .Qatar World Cup 2022 chief executive Nasser al-Khater confirmed that a worker had died, but gave no further details. .The Philippines’ foreign ministry also confirmed the death, saying one of its nationals had died while working at a resort south of the capital Doha and the embassy was “working with legal authorities to ascertain more details of his passing”. .The final of the World Cup will be held on Sunday at Lusail Stadium, the biggest venue to host World Cup 2022 matches.

77,Published On 14 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: Morocco and Argentina channel the spirit of 1986,,".As Julian Alvarez, the 22-year-old Argentinian forward, dribbled across half the pitch on Tuesday, dodging last-ditch tackles from Croatian defenders and latching onto a favourable deflection before dinking the ball past the goalkeeper, there was a sense that this had all happened before. .Alvarez’s goal in the 2022 World Cup semifinal was in many ways a more fortuitous version of that scored by Argentinian footballing legend Diego Maradona against England at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, in which he dribbled past half of the English defence before slotting it home and reeling off towards the stands in celebration. .On Tuesday, Argentinian flags could be seen draped around Lusail Stadium bearing the iconic image of Maradona in 1986 – a tournament in which he guided La Albiceleste to World Cup victory. .As Alvarez celebrated with his teammates, Lionel Messi, Maradona’s successor as the icon of Argentinian football and one of the world’s greatest-ever players, put his arm around the forward. It seemed like history was repeating itself and their fans could feel it, chanting and cheering their team on long after the final whistle. .The parallels between the two tournaments are not just confined to the Latin American team. .Morocco have arguably been the tournament’s greatest success story, making it to the semifinals for the first time in their history – and in the history of African and Arab nations at the World Cup. Before 2022, Moroccan football’s peak moment was in 1986. .After remaining undefeated in the group stage, they narrowly lost to a last-gasp goal from the eventual finalists, West Germany, in the round of 16. .Morocco boasted some fine defensive displays in Mexico, only conceding two goals in four games. This year they have bettered this record, only letting in one goal in five matches. .In 1986, Morocco knocked out Portugal by beating them 3-1 in the group stages; this year, they went one step further, eliminating two Iberian footballing giants – Portugal and Spain – in the knockout stages. .Morocco will face France in this year’s other semifinal, a team that also made it to the same stage in 1986, where they lost to West Germany. .As much as the two tournaments resonate with the two teams, there are some noticeable differences. .Unlike Morocco who have already gone further than they did 36 years ago, Argentina have yet to equal their historic World Cup win. They also lost their first match this year, a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia, whereas, in 1986, they remained unbeaten. .At the age of 35, Messi cannot compete with the surging, devastating pace of the 25-year-old Maradona who lit up the World Cup in 1986. However, the Paris Saint-Germain superstar has rolled back the years and netted five goals so far, the same number that Maradona scored in Mexico. .Before the 2022 World Cup began, the 1986 tournament was the benchmark that every Moroccan and Argentine team wanted to emulate. .For many fans too young to remember the World Cup in Mexico, it was merely a great story from another era – a time when Maradona lit up the greatest footballing stage, and the Atlas Lions shocked the world by making it to the knockout stages. .The 2022 World Cup has already changed that for Morocco. Will it also do so for Argentina?",77
78,Published On 14 Dec 2022,‘Nya’: How Morocco has been galvanised by World Cup success,Morocco’s victories against major football powers unite people who for the last years have been facing economic crisis.,".Rabat, Morocco – There is one thing everyone in Morocco has on their minds since the football team’s victory against Portugal: a World Cup trophy. .It’s something the population of 37 million feels more than declares. The streets of the Moroccan capital, Rabat, look like any administrative metropolis on a weekday. .Its fast-paced, goal-oriented populace race from one end to another, its streets packed with customers, workers and pigeons in search of the day’s meal. .And yet, ask anyone and Morocco’s collective obsession over the World Cup and the nation’s historic rise in it comes out. .“Seriously, we have gotten so far, how could we not go farther,” 18-year-old Ahmad Alami told Al Jazeera, speaking alongside his friends who nodded in blind agreement. .“Nya,” Alami’s friend Ayman Alouchi implored. .“Nya” is a word that thrummed in the mind of all Moroccans ever since this World Cup fairytale began with the shock wins over Belgium, Canada, Spain and Portugal. It translates to “have faith” but tells the team to “do your part and have faith in God”. .“Nya” became a popularly used expression when Morocco’s coach Walid Regragui first referred to it in a pre-match World Cup press conference ahead of the match against Belgium. The win saw the trust in Regragui’s leadership, and his calls for faith, emerge as a symbol of Moroccans’ loyal support for the national team. .The expression is now affirmed by politicians, media, fans and people from all walks of life to represent Morocco’s historic and unexpected rise to the ranks of football giants. .The word, now synonymous with Morocco in the World Cup, has reached such magnitude that the country’s ministry of religious affairs, one of the bodies closest to the Royal Palace, broadcast on Tuesday a message asking Moroccans to increase their “nya”. .The kinetic excitement is shared across the country’s public institutions. In Parliament, a session dedicated to discussing the country’s severe drought on Monday turned to messages of congratulations, wishes of success and mostly prideful monologues by MPs on what it means to be Moroccan. .Likewise, the feeling spread across the nation’s rural and urban, rich and poor, developed and deprived to unite a people who for the last years suffered one blow after another. .The pandemic and now a drought in the making has set costs of life soaring high, but for 34-year-old merchant Amina El Ouafi, Morocco’s presence at a World Cup semifinal is a step out of mundane life for her and her children. .“It’s been so long that I was able to do something nice for my children,” she said. .“I can barely cover our monthly expenses, but I told myself why not – I will do it now,” she added, before describing the bright red and green shirts she bought for her six and 12-year-old ahead of the semifinal. .They cost her a day’s worth of food. .Ouafi spoke near a café in central Rabat where a group of senior citizens were playing checkers. .“By God’s will, you will not be disappointed,” a man in the group addressed her. .She turned and smiled, hands lifted in prayer – a gesture that has now become common among Moroccans, who, while known to be a friendly bunch, have turned their friendliness up a couple more notches as their team progresses in the World Cup. .The man who addressed her, 71-year-old Ali Maarouf, said that being able to witness Wednesday’s game was a gift from God. .“You know, if he doesn’t take me by tomorrow,” he said, giggling. .Maarouf, who is suffering from heart disease and is partially blind said that, for lack of a better alternative, he would follow the game on the radio. .Morocco’s state-owned TV channels have been unable to show the Atlas Lions World Cup matches but authorities, since Sunday, rushed to install large screens in city squares to enable citizens to follow the Atlas Lion’s match against France in the semifinal. .“It would not matter if we win or lose. I’m just really happy we could reach such a high. It feels like the perfect way to close the year, to look forward to what’s to come and to have a renewed sense of unity,” 31-year-old Smail Lahmidi, whose car is decorated in Morocco’s iconic red and green, said. .“It is an unbelievable year for us all.”",78
79,Published On 14 Dec 2022,Fears of trouble in Paris ahead of Morocco-France World Cup game,"Moroccan celebrations have lit up capitals around the world, but in Western Europe, attempts to constrain them have been met with violence.",".There are few more magical places than Paris in the wintertime. .Christmas markets and ice rinks draw the masses, while crepe stands provide what feels like warm hugs for the tongue. The city of love’s festive season is always lucrative as millions of tourists from around the world descend on the French capital. .This year, however, the 2022 FIFA World Cup has interrupted regular scheduled programming. As France prepares to play Morocco in the second semifinal of the tournament, central Paris is preparing to batten down the hatches. .The French interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, has announced that the city would be mobilising 10,000 police officers – half of them solely dedicated to guarding the Champs Elysees, in what his ministry has called crowd control and terrorism prevention operations. .The drastic measures are anticipatory after the incidents that transpired following Morocco’s historic victory against Portugal in the World Cup quarterfinals. .In many large cities around the world, spontaneous celebrations erupted in good-natured fun. .Moroccan rapper French Montana led an impromptu party in the heart of New York’s Times Square. Montreal’s North African district along Jean-Talon Street was flooded with Moroccan flags, emerald smoke bombs, music and dance. As has become habit, Doha’s Souq Waqif was the place fans finished their World Cup evenings before calling it a night. .The Parisian celebration, however, was ugly. Heavily equipped police officers clashed with some of the 20,000 supporters who congregated along the Champs Elysees. Tear gas was deployed and approximately 100 people were arrested on various charges, according to the French interior ministry. .In France, this has become an unwelcome tradition whenever a North African national football team plays an important match in a notable international competition, leading many to question the reason for the disparity between the tensions felt in Paris and other Western European cities, and those elsewhere. .Mahfoud Amara, a professor at Qatar University, and author of Sport, Politics and Society in the Arab World, believes that the cause is the heavy-handedness of the authorities. .“The security apparatus in countries like France, Belgium reacts to supporters from the Maghreb [western North Africa] celebrating a football match as if it’s a security threat,” Amara told Al Jazeera. “They assume that large numbers will automatically translate to be trouble. Therefore, they need to be controlled and kept away from the city centres. That instinct to constrain the celebrations can quickly turn to tension.” .Sarah, a French-Moroccan visual artist who did not wish to give her real name, attended the celebrations in central Paris, which quickly degenerated. .“Initially, there was a warm, jovial atmosphere,” she recounted. .“Everyone was so excited. Of course, there were a lot of young people, but also families and children. I was there alone with my camera, but never feared for my safety. Then the police blocked a road and gassed us. One lady fell down and people were helping her up. It was chaos.” .Before the game, the Paris Police Prefecture said it was “putting in place a security disposition to fight against delinquency and assure the security of people and property in Paris”. .However, Sarah noted that she did not recall seeing any skirmishes when the security presence was weaker after Morocco triumphed over Spain in the World Cup round of 16 a few days prior. .Earlier this year French public authorities, and Darmanin in particular, were severely criticised for how crowds were managed during May’s UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool. .Kickoff was delayed by a total of 36 minutes due to a large number of fans outside of the stadium unable to gain access to the ground, despite many showing up with a ticket in hand in the vicinity of the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb. .In the immediate aftermath, Darmanin asserted that, “between 35,000 and 40,000 supporters without tickets, or with counterfeit tickets, were present around the Stade de France”. That statement was contradicted by many journalists who attended, as well as fact checkers. .Despite criticism of the approach of security forces, Darmanin refused to apologise for anything apart from “the disproportionate use of tear gas” and said that “if there is something that went wrong at the Stade de France, it is the fight against delinquency”. .That ignored the criticisms related to the lack of crowd control to and from public transport stations and the use of pepper spray against fans. .For Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French legal scholar and a PhD candidate at the University Toulouse-Capitole, the policing structures in place are failing to protect the people they are supposed to serve. .“There are many reports about the horrific issue of racial profiling from French police. For some in certain demographics, French cops can even be perceived as a threat. There is no relationship of trust – that was broken a long time ago,” Alouane told Al Jazeera. .Throughout working-class neighbourhoods in France, it is common to see random “stop-and-frisk” searches of visible minorities. In that sense, police are often preemptively positioned as adversarial entities for many young French people of North African descent. .The French government has made some efforts in the past to address racial discrimination by the police, such as establishing a website that allows citizens to be consulted on the topic, but critics say these steps do not go far enough. .Like Sarah, Yassine, a 30-year-old Algerian supporter, also made his way to the Champs Elysees, although he was more of a passive observer than a supporter. When he saw how tense the atmosphere had become, he quickly returned home. .“My theory is that there are some supporters that feel like fighting with the police is like a symbolic revenge against the violence of daily life. Things like police identification stops, the feeling of being discriminated against, common political discourse against immigrants and Islam, etc,” Yassine explained. .Despite the likelihood of violence, Sarah still plans on celebrating with her compatriots if Morocco can upset the reigning world champions and advance to a World Cup final. .“I plan on going out and I will. I am aware of the risks, but for me, they don’t stand up to the joy of a potential victory. I want to continue witnessing history and celebrate it with all those who share this pride and joy.”",79
80,Published On 14 Dec 2022,World Cup’s apex players: Argentina’s Messi and Alvarez,Lionel Messi scored a penalty then set up two goals for Julian Alvarez for a 3-0 win in the semifinal against Croatia.,".The bad news for whoever faces Argentina in Sunday’s World Cup final is that footballing magician Lionel Messi now has an apprentice in 22-year-old Julian Alvarez who scored twice in Argentina’s commanding semifinal win over Croatia. .Messi scored a penalty and then set up two goals for Alvarez, sealing a 3-0 defeat of the Croats that advanced Argentina to Sunday’s final against either France or Morocco. .Messi and Alvarez were described by the Associated Press as being like a pair of predators working in partnership on the pitch against Croatia on Tuesday night. .A tight-fought first half-hour was entirely turned upside down by Alvarez’s runs as he barrelled at speed into and through challenges in a devastating five-minute spell that left Croatia’s players strewn behind him on the grass. .Alvarez, who became the youngest player to score twice in a World Cup semifinal match since a 17-year-old Pele scored a hat trick for Brazil in 1958, now has four goals so far in this World Cup tournament, placing him just one behind joint top scorers Messi and France’s Kylian Mbappe. .But Alvarez’s path to his World Cup appearance was anything but smooth. .He had to fight his way into the starting lineup as Argentinian coach Lionel Scaloni initially preferred Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez. He then stayed on the bench during the shock 2-1 defeat Argentina suffered to Saudi Arabia in the tournament’s group stage. He also sat out the 2-0 win over Mexico that steadied Argentina’s campaign. .Getting his first start in the 2-0 win over Poland that secured Argentina’s passage to the tournament’s last 16 – and scoring his team’s second goal for good measure – Alvarez has been in the starting lineup since. He scored the crucial second goal in the 2-1 victory over Australia in the round of 16, and then caused the Netherlands plenty of problems in the quarterfinal. .Aside from the two goals on Tuesday against Croatia, both taken in ice-cool fashion, Alvarez stretched the Croatian defence with his constant running and probing. .It was a performance that left Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni purring. .“Julian played very well, not just because of his goals but also because he worked so hard to help against their three midfielders,” Scaloni said. .“At his age, it is normal that he wants to conquer the world.” .Of Messi, Scaloni said he had “no doubt” he is the greatest player of all time. .“So there is nothing left to say about Messi. It’s indeed a privilege to have him in the squad,” he said. .  .After taking applause for his performance at Lusail Stadium, Alvarez now has his sights set on Sunday’s challenge. .“We deserved this. We played a great game today. We’re in the final, which is what we wanted and now we need to rest and hope for a great game on Sunday,” Alvarez said after the Croatia match, and what was his greatest night so far wearing the famous light blue and white striped jersey. .“I’m happy on a personal level and for the group. We are happy with the way we are playing. We deserve to be in the final. That’s what we wanted,” he said. .While Messi will now hope to bow out as an absolute superstar of football with the one trophy that has eluded him, Alvarez is at the other end of his career. .",80

82,Published On 14 Dec 2022,PSG stars Mbappe and Hakimi set for epic World Cup ‘duel’,The two friends will become rivals on Wednesday as France take on Morocco in the World Cup semifinal.,".They stand shoulder to shoulder when facing the best teams in Europe – playing week in, week out as teammates in the devastating lineup of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). They hang out off the pitch. And they’ve even gone on holiday together. .But all that will change when the whistle blows in Al Bayt Stadium on Wednesday night. For at least 90 minutes, France’s Kylian Mbappe and Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi will be arch-foes, hell-bent on beating the other for a place in the World Cup final. .During a PSG trip earlier this year to Qatar, the site of the 2022 World Cup, they raised the prospect of facing each other. .“I have to destroy my friend,” Mbappe joked in a short video message. “It will break my heart a little bit, but you know, that is football. I have to kill him.” .Hakimi’s response? “I’m going to smash him,” the 24-year-old Moroccan wing-back said with a smile. . .It’s a face-off being relished by football fans all around the world. Both men are fast. Really fast. Mbappe was clocked reaching 35.6km/h (22.1mph) during this season’s UEFA Champions League. Hakimi also hit 35km/h. .It’s not just about speed, though. According to the number crunchers, Hakimi completes more passes (an average of 91 in a 90-minute game, compared with Mbappe’s 84) and wins more challenges (53 per 90 for Hakimi, just 32 for Mbappe). .But Mbappe scores many more goals. .Defensively, Hakimi’s record is stellar. No one has yet been able to score against Morocco in this tournament: the only goal they have conceded was an own goal. .But Hakimi will not just be tasked with stopping France’s 23-year-old superstar Mbappe. He has attacking responsibilities of his own, with Morocco looking to strike on the counter in their games at the World Cup so far. .“It’s going to be a great duel between the two,” Morocco head coach Walid Regragui told reporters on Tuesday. “They’re both champions, world-class players and they’re both going to be going at it. .“We should be focusing on what we can do to cause problems for France … we’re going to have to counter the threat of Kylian. But I have no doubt that Hakimi will be on top form to get the better of his friend.” .The friendship is clear: they celebrate goals with the same penguin dance routine, they went on holiday to Spain together, and they’ve reportedly even been spotted hanging out in Qatar together. .“It’s a pleasure to have him by my side. He is one of the best players in the world, but above all, he is my friend. I love him,” Hakimi told Telefoot. .",82
83,Published On 14 Dec 2022,"A France vs Morocco World Cup contest, 110 years in the making","As the Atlas Lions prepare to face Les Blues, Al Jazeera looks at the recent history between Morocco and its former coloniser, France.",".There’s always a first time – even for those who have known each other for more than a century. .On Wednesday, Morocco and its former coloniser, France, will face off in a World Cup semifinal, the first time the two sides meet in a football contest outside of friendly games and exhibition matches. But a long and complex history – and present – shadows relations between the nations separated by the Mediterranean Sea. .There are more than 780,000 people of Moroccan origin in France, according to the French Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. And a recent visa dispute has made it difficult for relatives in Morocco to visit them. .French President Emmanuel Macron, whose government introduced the visa restrictions, is expected to be in the stands during the semifinal. .If the Morocco side – in their first-ever World Cup semifinal – need extra inspiration against France, they have more than a century of history to dip into. .France signed the Treaty of Fes with Morocco’s Sultan Abdul Hafiz in 1912, officially making Morocco a French protectorate and spending the subsequent years establishing a colony there. During World War I, France conscripted some 40,000 Moroccan soldiers to fight in its colonial army. .But anticolonial resentment against France was growing and gained further ground during World War II – a period that saw many former European colonies achieve independence. In 1944, the newly formed Istiqlal Party issued a Proclamation of Independence for Morocco. .In 1952, an anti-colonial uprising in Casablanca was violently repressed by French authorities, who subsequently outlawed the Moroccan Communist and Istiqlal parties and exiled Sultan Mohamed V to Madagascar. .This move galvanised resistance to colonial rule further and, eventually, France allowed Mohamed V to return to Morocco. The sultan declared independence on November 18, 1955, and the French protectorate ended in March 1956. .After independence, several domestic policies were implemented to help the country move away from French influence while retaining good relations with what remained a vital diplomatic and economic partner. .In 1973, King Hassan II enacted a series of economic reforms in the private sector that transferred more than 50 percent of foreign-owned enterprises – most of which were French-owned – to Moroccan ownership. .In the 1980s, the king implemented an Arabisation policy of the schooling system, switching the language of instruction from French to Arabic. Thirty years later, the policy was reversed for secondary school maths, science, and physics. .France has remained Morocco’s primary foreign investor and trade partner and has subsequently made efforts to retain friendly relations. .These have included several high-profile diplomatic meetings, including a 2007 visit by France’s then-President Nicholas Sarkozy to Morocco to oversee the start of the construction of Al Boraq, a high-speed train service that France was financing 51 percent of. .Two months later, the two countries played each other in an international football friendly in France. The game ended in a 2-2 draw. .But complex relations rarely follow a straight path. In 2014, Morocco suspended judicial cooperation with France after authorities in Paris attempted to question Abdellatif Hammouchi, the head of Morocco’s domestic intelligence service, over torture allegations. Diplomatic tensions eased a year later and the countries resumed cooperation. .In 2018, King Mohammed VI and French President Emmanuel Macron boarded the new high-speed rail link for its inaugural trip between Tangier and Morocco’s capital Rabat. .In many ways, relations appear to be on the upswing. Earlier this year, Macron backed Morocco’s plan of autonomy for Western Sahara under its rule. A movement led by Western Sahara’s Polisario Front has long sought independence from Morocco. .Macron’s move came after former US President Donald Trump recognised Morocco’s sovereignty over the disputed territory in December 2020, a stance unchanged under President Joe Biden’s administration. .But niggles remain. In September 2021, relations between the countries took a hit after France announced they would reduce the number of visas issued to Moroccan and Algerian nationals by 50 percent and by two-thirds for Tunisians. .The French government said it was a response to the North African governments’ refusal to take back asylum seekers sent away by French authorities. .Morocco’s foreign minister Nasser Bourita described the move as “unjustified”. Bourita said he had issued 400 consular documents to Moroccans being expelled from France, but they had refused to take a mandatory COVID-19 test needed to re-enter the North African nation, which he said was “the problem of France”. .It’s clear that both nations recognise the importance of their bilateral relationship. Macron is scheduled to visit Rabat in January 2023. But first, the football teams of the two nations will square off in a historic World Cup semifinal. If history is any guide, it won’t be an easy game for either side.",83
84,Published On 14 Dec 2022,"The story of Yassine Bounou, Morocco’s smiling World Cup hero",The Moroccan goalkeeper has been instrumental in his country’s run to the World Cup semifinals.,".The Moroccan national team is in the semifinals of the World Cup – a first for both African and Arab countries. .Pundits have been unanimous in their analysis: The Atlas Lions have advanced this far because of their stellar defending. The football team has conceded just one goal in the tournament – an own goal against Canada. .A compact 4-1-4-1 defensive bloc has squeezed out any space that could be found between the lines in midfield and defence. .The only thing more frustrating for their opponents than their impermeable defending is glancing over at Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou and realising that he is smiling through it all. . .Take the tense shootout in the last 16 against Spain, for example. The 31-year-old was photographed shooting a toothy grin, while mid-air, at Sergio Busquets before successfully parrying Spain’s third penalty kick. .It was one of about a dozen wry smiles he shot the Spanish and Portuguese players throughout the knockout stages. .“If he’s not smiling, there’s a problem,” Christophe Revel, Bounou’s former goalkeeping coach for the Moroccan national team, revealed to Radio France International. .In most of his sit-down interviews, the goalkeeper sits back cross-legged and thoroughly thinks through his answers before responding pensively. .If he weren’t a footballer, it is very easy to imagine him with a career in academia. .Bounou was born in Montreal, Canada. The family moved back to Casablanca, Morocco when he was three. There, he grew up in a comfortable, middle-class setting, and eventually attended one of Morocco’s best French secondary schools. .But Bounou’s laid-back attitude does not come from a place of arrogance. Rather, his serene personality originates from being exposed to high-pressure situations early in his career. .After joining Wydad Athletic Club at the age of eight, Bounou quickly rose up the ranks of Morocco’s most successful football club. Still, nothing could have prepared him for his eventual professional debut, which came in the second leg of the 2011 African Champions League final against Tunisian giants, Espérance Sportive de Tunis. .“It was difficult for that to be my first match. I felt like if the game went poorly, my career could have gone one way, and if I did well, it would have gone the other way,” he told Moroccan TV channel M24TV prior to the World Cup. .He pulled off a string of saves but was beaten by a world-class effort from Ghanaian fullback Harrison Afful. Despite the result, his performance on the night caught the eye of Atletico de Madrid scouts who offered him a contract to play for Los Colchoneros. .The Madrid club initially proposed a salary less than what he was getting at Wydad and they were also clear he would play third fiddle to Thibaut Courtois and Jan Oblak. .Proving his ambition, Bounou jumped on the opportunity. .Predictably, Bounou needed successive loan spells to second-division club Real Zaragoza and then a horizontal move to Girona FC to earn game time. His toils in the second division were happily punctuated with Girona’s promotion to La Liga, which eventually earned him a move to one of Spain’s biggest clubs, Sevilla FC. He has blossomed into a world-class keeper ever since. .During the 2021-2022 Liga season, Bounou posted a save percentage of almost 78 percent, which was the sixth-best in Europe. .Throughout 2021, he also kept more clean sheets than any goalkeeper in Europe when counting matches for club and country – 32 in 59 matches. .“He’s a top keeper,” Revel said. “He’s mastered one-on-ones, he quickly goes to the ground, he has great feet and he can read the aerial game well, too. Most importantly, he is cold-blooded … if he had been the goalkeeper for Belgium or England, he would be a star, but Morocco is not the most followed nation.” .Off of the pitch, the relaxed net-minder has learned to become more of a leader. At Sevilla, he plays a “big brother” role for the two other Moroccan internationals at the club: Youssef En-Nesyri and Munir El Haddadi. .His relationship with the former is particularly strong, to the point that when he received his player-of-the-match award in the World Cup quarterfinal win over Portugal, Bounou turned right around and dedicated the trophy to En-Nesyri. .As a public figure, Bounou has also demonstrated that he understands that it is now paramount to be careful of his public image. .“We have a responsibility to play well, but also be aware that we represent Morocco abroad and the people we meet view us that way,” he added in the interview with M24TV. .“Just as [Noureddine] Naybet and Zaki [Badou] led the way for us, we have to set a good example for Moroccan kids who want to follow in our footsteps.” .Moroccans of all walks of life are hanging on to every second of this fairytale 2022 World Cup journey and they owe a lot of their joy to Bounou. .In a post-match press conference, coach Walid Regragui affirmed that observation. .“When you know you have Bounou in goal, that always gives you confidence … he’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world,” he said. .Morocco will most likely employ the same stifling tactics for their semifinal against France. Yet even if the reigning world champions manage to do the improbable and pierce Regragui’s defensive lines, they still would have the gargantuan task of beating Bounou and his goofy smirk. .And that may prove to be quite an obstacle.",84

Morocco have the hopes and dreams of the entire Arab world, not to mention the support of most neutrals. .Whatever happens in the game, history will be made at Al Bayt Stadium, the giant Bedouin tent in Al Khor, with Morocco the first Arab or African nation to make it to the semifinals of a World Cup. .The French are overwhelmingly the favourites in this match, but Morocco have claimed some notable scalps on their way here – Belgium, Spain and Portugal were all talked about as serious contenders for the title, and all fell to the Atlas Lions. Morocco’s coach Walid Regragui on Tuesday made clear that his side were going to try their best to pull off another “upset” in their fairytale run. .Walid Cheddira is suspended for the semifinal after being sent off in the win over Portugal, while captain Romain Saiss is a potential injury concern for Morocco in defence. Having missed the quarterfinal, it’s not yet clear if Nayef Aguerd and Noussair Mazraoui will be fighting fit in time for Wednesday’s match. .Morocco’s place in the semifinal isn’t down to luck. It’s down to sheer hard work, grit, determination and talent. They deserve to be here just as much as anyone else. Morocco have not fluked it – they should now be considered one of the footballing world’s top sides. You do not make it to a World Cup semifinal by chance. .And then there’s France. This extraordinary team, missing many of its star players, yet with the depth to produce absolute champagne football. They have flair, consistency and muscle. Plus, they’ve been here before. Head coach Didier Deschamps is one of only three men to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a manager. .France’s play has been hallmarked by speed and attack. Mbappe streaks away from defenders as if the ball were tied to his boot – like watching Lionel Messi a decade ago. Indeed, Mbappe is just one shy of Messi’s World Cup goal tally – but he’s only 23, and could easily be playing in another two World Cups before he even turns 32. .Giroud brings the calm experience to the attacking line; a wise head that the veteran can still use to devastating effect. Griezmann remains the all-round playmaker, directing the game with pinpoint precision. .And that’s just thinking about France’s top line. They have no suspensions among their team to worry about. Sitting deep, they’ve got such talent as Theo Hernandez, who is one of Europe’s best left-backs. .Morocco will be looking to slow the game down, control and neutralise the pace of Mbappe, and frustrate France into lapses of discipline or skill. When in possession, they’ll be hoping to put the ball at the feet of Achraf Hakimi, Mbappe’s teammate at Paris Saint-Germain, and Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech, to see if the star pairing can make a little more magic for Morocco. .This will be neither team’s last game in Qatar; the losing team will still have to play arguably the worst match in any competition – the third-place playoff – at Khalifa International Stadium on Saturday night. .The winners, however, go on to sport’s biggest event. Watched by quite possibly billions of people, the World Cup final will be held on Sunday, Qatar’s national day, at Lusail Stadium. Glory awaits.",86

And to finish like this, it’s the best,” the Argentina captain said. . .The 35-year-old is playing at his fifth World Cup, surpassing the four of former Argentinian stars Diego Maradona and Javier Mascherano. .With his fifth goal in Qatar, he also surpassed Gabriel Batistuta as the top Albiceleste scorer at a World Cup, netting 11 times. .“It’s all well and good (the records), but the important thing is to be able to achieve the group objective, which is the most beautiful thing of all,” Messi added. .“We’re just one step away, after fighting hard, and we’re going to give everything to try to make it happen this time.” .France plays Morocco in the other semifinal on Wednesday and the winner of that match will play Argentina on Sunday.",87
88,Published On 14 Dec 2022,France injury concerns ahead of World Cup semifinal with Morocco,France defender Dayot Upamecano and midfielder Adrien Rabiot missed team training on the eve of the game against Morocco.,".Two of France’s key players are “serious doubts” for starting in the World Cup semifinal match against Morocco due to illness, while the Atlas Lions’s coach Walid Regragui has rallied his team to fight to get through to the final on behalf of African nations and the Arab world. .In a significant blow for head coach Didier Deschamps, France defender Dayot Upamecano and midfielder Adrien Rabiot are both doubtful to start in their side’s World Cup semifinal match on Wednesday after missing a team training session on Tuesday due to illness, the French Football Federation (FFF) said. .Upamecano, who was reported to have a sore throat, and Rabiot, who had an unspecified illness, were on light training indoors, the federation said. Upamecano had already missed France’s training session on Monday. .Should the two players be ruled out, coach Deschamps is expected to start Ibrahima Konate at centre back while Youssouf Fofana would be expected to be alongside Antoine Griezmann and Aurelien Tchouameni in the midfield. .Tchouameni, who scored in France’s victory over England on Saturday, was also absent from training on Monday due to discomfort in his left leg but returned to the training pitch on Tuesday and should be fit for the Morocco match. The midfielder is the only player to have started in every game during the French World Cup campaign. .Morocco, who also continued training and pre-match preparations on Tuesday, also have injury concerns related to skipper Romain Saiss and centre back Nayef Aguerd. .Moroccan coach Walid Regragui said no player had been either ruled in or out of Wednesday’s game. .“We have good doctors and every day we get good news. No one is ruled out and no one is for certain,” Regragui said. .“We’ll use the best team possible.” .Regragui also said he had no specific plans about how Morocco will deal with the danger of France’s Kylian Mbappe. The French side’s attack poses too many individual threats to just concentrate on one player, he said. .Mbappe is the tournament’s top scorer with five goals and, playing on the left of the attack for France, he goes up against Paris St Germain club mate and close friend Achraf Hakimi, who is Morocco’s highly rated right back. .Regragui said Hakimi is looking forward to a “nice duel” with his friend Mbappé but added that France does not just depend on its star player. .“We’ll have to block Kylian, but not just him,” Regragui said. .“Hakimi is super motivated to beat his friend.” .  .The key to winning the game, the coach said, will be Morocco’s “team spirit” and the support of the crowd at Al Bayt Stadium, where French President Emmanuel Macron is set to be in attendance along with tens of thousands of green-and-red-clad Morocco fans. .“We have the best fans in the world along with Argentines and Brazilians. They’re people who come from anywhere in the world to support their country,” Regragui said. .“We’re going to play like being at home and that’s the most important thing in the world.” .Regragui said his team is ready to “change the mentality” of Africa and he has told his players not to settle for anything less than the top prize. .“We’re going to fight to move on, for the African nations, for the Arab world,” he said. .The match has cultural and political connotations that go beyond football as Morocco was under French rule from 1912 to 1956. .France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris warned on Tuesday that Morocco will be a close and difficult encounter. .“Believe me, they won’t stop,” said Lloris of Morocco, adding that France would need to raise their level and be at the top of their game. .Asked about the famously impenetrable Morocco defence, Lloris said the key would lie in breaking them down “as early as possible in the match”. .Team coach Deschamps also called Morocco’s defence “the best at this World Cup”. .Morocco have conceded just once – and that was an own goal – in the tournament so far but Deschamps said France will find a way through and “break them down and create opportunities ourselves to score goals”. .Deschamps again singled out Antoine Griezmann as a potential match-winner. .“He’s the type of player who can really change a team because he’s so hard-working and so technically gifted,” said the boss of Les Bleus. .Morocco go into the semifinal looking to add France to an impressive list of victories after defeating Belgium, Spain and Portugal. Their qualification for the final four has made them the first African and Arab country to ever reach a World Cup semifinal. .But Les Blues are favourites to defend their 2018 crown in Qatar and if they win the tournament they would become the first side to secure back-to-back trophies since Brazil in 1962. .The winner of the France vs Morocco match will face Argentina in the final on Sunday. .",88

In reality, they came hoping to see another vintage performance from Lionel Messi, the diminutive figure wearing the number 10 on his Argentina jersey. .In this tournament, fans come to Argentina’s games expecting to see Messi deliver — and he did not disappoint. .For the first 30 minutes of the semifinal match, Croatia were the ones controlling the tempo, moving the ball around, trying to break up the Argentinian set-up. .The Albicelestes fans were not as boisterous as in other matches. There was tension in the air, and only hardcore supporters dared to make noise. .This pensiveness was not surprising as Croatia beat the South Americans 3-0 in their 2018 World Cup encounter. .Messi spent most of the first half hour of the match walking around, appearing to be in no rush, his body language not giving much away. .But, just as when Argentina faced Mexico and then against the Netherlands, Messi’s moments of magic were coming. .“We did not start well. Messi did not see a lot of the ball because of the way Croatia started,” said Cristian Rolero, an Argentinian who travelled from Miami to see his hero in action. .“Messi is God. How else do you describe what we saw tonight? Incredible player. There is no other player like him. Never, ever,” he said. .Croatia were in a confident mood looking to reach back-to-back World Cup finals and become the first team since Brazil in 2002 to do so. .But the Argentinian left-footer, who has won the Ballon d’Or seven times, had different plans. On the night that he joined German footballer Lothar Matthaus as joint holder of the record number of World Cup appearances at 25, Messi capped his landmark match with a memorable performance against Croatia. .After Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic fouled Julian Alvarez, Argentina’s all-time record goalscorer stepped forward and coolly dispatched the penalty. It was Messi’s fifth goal in this tournament, and he was not finished. He smelled blood and soon went on the rampage. .Then the chants began and the thousands of Argentina supporters clad in sky blue and white started singing Messi’s name. .Five minutes after scoring the penalty, Messi headed the ball to the lively Alvarez, who went on a mazy run before hitting the back of Croatia’s net. .“There is no player as consistent as Messi. He delivers whenever we need him. He takes responsibility. He shows the world he is the best,” Diego Dib told Al Jazeera. .Comparisons with Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo now need to end, Dib said. .“It is not fair or right when people compare him to Ronaldo. What has Ronaldo done in this World Cup? I hope that comparison is now finished for good.” .  .The Albicelestes were up 2-0, but their talisman was going to torment the Croats even more. The Croatia team were on the ropes and Messi was in the mood. Their fans were stunned. They sat in silence and could only watch in awe as the Paris Saint-Germain forward tore apart their backline. .Messi’s legs might be slowing, but even at 35 he still has one of the fastest football brains, as he showed in a brilliant run and assist for the third goal in the game. He made easy work of Croatia’s Josko Gvardiol, one of the standout defenders of the tournament, before setting up teammate Alvarez for his second score of the night. .“No human being can stop Messi. You can put as many defenders as you want in front of him, he will find a way,” Ricardo Falu told Al Jazeera. .“When other teams see him they give up before the game starts. They know they will lose. He has that impact on other teams,” Falu said before rushing off to join other fans at the entertainment zone outside Lusail Stadium. .When the clock reached 90 minutes, and five minutes of added time was announced, the stadium’s seats were still full. No one was leaving early in case Messi had more in store. But there was to be no more. The Croats were humbled by Messi magic. .“Without Messi, there is no way they [would] have beaten us,” said Jan Maric, a Croatia supporter. “They have the best player in the world. Without him they are very average. We [would] have beat them badly,” he added. .After the final whistle, Argentinian players rushed to their captain, all hugs and high fives. The “little magician” then joined his teammates as they serenaded their loyal fans behind the Croatian goal. .Messi and his team will be back in Lusail on Sunday for the World Cup final, where he hopes to win the only prize still missing from his extensive collection of trophies and titles.",89

Ivan Perisic failed to catch Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez off the line, the counter was sprung, the players hurtled down the pitch, and Julian Alvarez found himself one-on-one with Croatia’s goalkeeper, Dominik Livakovic. .In a split-second, Livakovic came off his line and into the path of Alvarez, setting up a collision. Livakovic reached for the ball and challenged the player. He could not make contact with the ball, but did with Alvarez. Foul. Yellow card for the keeper. Penalty for Argentina. .Lionel Messi — who else? — stepped forward and delivered a truly unstoppable strike. His eleventh goal at a World Cup took him past the great Gabriel Batistuta’s Argentinian record for most World Cup goals. .And the whole game changed in that moment. .Just five minutes later, Alvarez demonstrated his persistence once again. A stunning run that began on his own goal line, picking up a pass from Messi in the Argentinian half, a straight-line run at a pace that meant he had no option but to go it alone. Three defenders to beat, and not one could touch him. .He got two lucky bounces as he closed in on the penalty area, then another to toe it past Livakovic in goal, doubling Argentina’s lead. .It seemed like Argentina only had two meaningful kicks in the first half, but they were enough to wrap the game up. .The second half picked up as the first left off, with Argentina in control. .In the 73rd minute, Messi picked up the ball on the left under challenge from Josko Gvardiol and pulled off another trademark run: with startling speed and control, he danced towards the box. .Gvardiol had no chance. Messi turned, jigged along the goal line, and passed it off for Alvarez to finish. Another special moment from probably the best player to ever play this game. .That is not to say Croatia made it easy for Messi’s men. Luka Modric did what he does best, commanding the midfield and leading by example. They worked hard and created occasional chances but lacked the ability to capitalise on those rare opportunities when they fell to them. .They will not be packing their bags just yet, however. Croatia will be back in action at the Khalifa International Stadium on Saturday for the third-place playoff. .Meanwhile, Argentina have a date with destiny on Sunday, 15:00 GMT, back at Lusail’s Iconic Stadium.",92

They last appeared in a final in 2014, when they were beaten 1-0 by Germany. .Clinching the trophy would also elevate seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi to the mythical status that the late Diego Maradona enjoys in the South American country. .The final could mark his last appearance at the World Cup, with the Paris Saint-Germain forward having hinted the 2022 edition will be his last. .It could yet be the perfect way to go out for a player widely regarded as one of the game’s finest ever players, if not the best. .“A lot is going through my head – it’s very emotional seeing all of this,” Messi said in a post-match interview on the field as he looked up at Argentina’s celebrating, scarf-waving supporters. .“To see the fans – ‘the family’ – during the whole tournament was so incredible.

Demand soared even higher after the Atlas Lions beat Spain and Portugal in the knockout stages. .“Every time Morocco won, we would place an order for hundreds more [shirts] and sell out by mid-afternoon on the day of the next game,” Sadiq said. .Since the team qualified for the semifinals, thousands of fans have been flying into Doha from various parts of the world. Upon arrival in Doha, their first stop is Souq Waqif, and the first item on their shopping list is either a Morocco shirt, or flag, and in some cases, both. .Anas El Karim flew in from Berlin a day after Morocco’s win over Portugal. .“I was told I would be able to find my team’s shirt here but it seems to have been sold out,” he said with a look of disappointment. .Sadiq, who had been digging through a pile of team shirts as his newest customer looked on, pulled one out to El Karim’s delight. .There are also many Doha-based fans who began supporting Morocco after their giant-killing spree in the latter stages of the tournament. .“I wasn’t a Morocco fan until I saw them beat the big European teams,” Yousuf Ahmed, a football fan from India, said while searching for a Morocco shirt in Sadiq’s shop. “I have been looking for their shirt for days now but every time I come here it is sold out, so now I will make do with a flag.” .The bright red flag with a green star at its centre has taken over the host country. Fans from across the Arab world carry and wave it proudly in stadiums and fan zones. It is draped over skyscrapers, hung from apartment balconies and waved from cars beeping their horns after every Moroccan win. .It is safe to say that the Moroccan flag is now second in popularity only to the Palestinian flag across Qatar. .“Even Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Indians come asking for Morocco’s flag,” said Sharf-ud-Din, a Nepali shopkeeper who has added World Cup paraphernalia to his clothing store. .When local shop owners realised they would not be able to procure enough flags to meet the high demand in time, they came up with a quick-fix solution: making the flags in Qatar. .“A group of Bangladeshi and Pakistani men got sheets of red cloth from a local market and made these flags at home,” Din said, pointing to a handmade Morocco flag hanging next to the flags of Qatar and Palestine. .“They have done a real botch job with the green pentagram, but the buyers don’t care,” he said with a chuckle. .Sadiq, who began selling the Morocco shirt at 30 riyals ($8) apiece, said he now sells poorer quality shirts for a minimum of 50 riyals ($14). .“Our suppliers have told us they don’t have any shirts left in Bangladesh or China, so we will make the most of the few dozen we have left,” he said matter-of-factly. .Shops have enjoyed great business over the past few weeks, and are now out to make the most in the last remaining days before the football frenzy makes way for regular business. .If Morocco ends up beating France in the semifinal, Sadiq will have to come up with a solution to meet the demands of even more Moroccan fans who will be out to paint the country red.",94
95,Published On 13 Dec 2022,Garrincha: Brazil’s ‘Joy of the People’,The troubled history of one of the greatest footballers to ever play the game.,".Before the emergence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the debate about the greatest footballer of all time had largely centred around another feted duo — Diego Maradona and Pele. .But many in Brazil and outside have long wondered whether Pele was even the best player that country has produced or whether the true owner of that title was Manuel Francisco dos Santos, better known by his nickname of Garrincha. .Those who saw Garrincha play still speak about the way he could effortlessly dribble past defenders with an unnatural balance or choose to accelerate past them with his speed. He asserted a rare control over the ball, and is credited with prompting the first shouts of “Ole” from spectators as if he were a matador teasing and tormenting a bull. .This rare talent took Garrincha from Pau Grande, a small village located to the north of Rio de Janeiro, to Botafogo – where he won three state championships – and then to the World Cup, which he helped Brazil win in 1958 and 1962. .“In the entire history of football, no one made more people happy,” the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano once said. Indeed, his former teammate Pele himself declared, “Garrincha was an incredible player, one of the best there has ever been. He could do things with the ball that no other player could do.” .Garrincha, whose grandparents had been enslaved, was born in October 1933 with his left leg six cm (2.3 inches) longer than his right. His left leg curved outward, while his right leg was bent inwards. He had an S-shaped spine. A doctor would later examine him and declare him a “cripple”. .He was a small and fragile child, which prompted his older sister Rosa to give him the nickname of “Garrincha”, which means “little bird” in Portuguese. .But his natural talent was too great to be restrained by his size, and on his debut for Botafogo in 1953, he scored three times against Bonsucesso. During the course of the following 12 seasons, he scored a total of 249 goals in 579 games for the club. .He made his international debut for Brazil in 1955, but was not selected for their opening two games at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. By the tournament’s third game, history was made when Garrincha and a 17-year-old Pele played together for the first time and helped their side earn a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union. .With the pair in the starting lineup, Brazil never lost in 40 games — a fact of which Pele proudly reminded the world in 2013. . .In Sweden, they combined to give their country new momentum, which saw them overcome Wales and France to reach the final against the hosts. On June 29, 1958, inspired by Garrincha, who created their opening two goals, Brazil won their first World Cup with a 5-2 win over Sweden in Stockholm. .As well as a winner’s medal, Garrincha was voted into the All-Star Team. .“Garrincha was more of a danger than Pele — he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic,” said the Wales full-back Mel Hopkins. “It was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot.” .His talent sparked interest from several leading European clubs, but despite lucrative approaches from Juventus, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, Garrincha was content to remain in Brazil. .Brazil arrived at the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile as the favourites, but disaster struck in their second game when Pele sustained a leg injury that forced him to miss the rest of the tournament. .But Garrincha stepped into the breach and led Brazil to a second consecutive World Cup. He scored twice against England in a 3-1 win in the quarterfinals and then twice again in the semifinals against host Chile, which Brazil won 4-2. He then overcame a severe fever to play in the 3-1 win against Czechoslovakia in the final in Santiago. .Garrincha became the first player to finish a World Cup as winner of the Golden Boot as top scorer, the winner of the Golden Ball as player of the tournament, a place in the All-Star Team, and most importantly, a winner’s medal. An impressed Chilean newspaper El Mercurio asked, “What planet is Garrincha from?” .He was still only 28 years old at this World Cup, but it would prove to be the peak of his career. The shape of his legs was beginning to cause him terrible pain, and within a year, the state of his knees would not let him play two consecutive games. .He had been advised to have an operation to correct his legs as far back as 1959 but had refused until he was finally forced to in 1964. By then it was too late, he already lost of most of his pace and mobility and was never the same player again. .He had comfortably played more than 30 games a season for most of his career. But he could not manage as many matches in total across three seasons following 1962. .In 1966 Garrincha managed to return to the World Cup and scored a memorable goal in a 2-0 win against Bulgaria, but he could not prevent his country from losing 3-1 to Hungary and being knocked out of the tournament at the group stage. That would prove to be his 50th and final appearance for Brazil and, incredibly, the first time he had ever lost while wearing the national jersey. .He was a carefree spirit, possibly too carefree — both on and off the pitch. He first became a father at the age of 18 and had another 13 children by five different women during his life. His father was an alcoholic, who died from it, and Garrincha, too, would drink heavily. .Garrincha’s injuries and reliance on alcohol had diminished him as a player by the end of the 1966 World Cup. Still, he continued for seven more years and featured sparingly for four clubs — Brazil’s Corinthians, Flamengo and Olaria, and Atletico Junior in Colombia. .In April 1969, he was believed to be drunk while driving a car when it was involved in an accident that killed his mother-in-law, Dona Rosario. There were reports he attempted to take his own life afterwards. .In 1973 at the age of 40, Garrincha officially retired with a farewell match between a FIFA team and Brazil, hosted at the iconic Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro in front of a crowd of 131,000. .Garrincha did not enjoy a happy retirement: He had not saved any of his earnings from his career, either because he had spent them or been taken advantage of by others. He did not even have enough to help secure a loan to buy a house. .He struggled for work, briefly representing the Brazilian Coffee Institute as an ambassador, and began to feel forgotten and almost abandoned by the football community. .On January 19, 1983, aged just 49, he slipped into an “alcoholic coma” and was rushed to hospital for his eighth visit that year. Early the following day, he died of cirrhosis of the liver. .A strong sense of grief gripped Brazil in the days afterwards, and millions would line the funeral procession between the Maracana and his hometown of Pau Grande. .While Brazil has produced many great players, few were loved as much as Garrincha for his rare talent and his imperfections. Many Brazilians could see themselves in him and how he so clearly played the game for fun. .On his gravestone is the simple and apt inscription: “Here rests in peace the one who was the Joy of the People – Mané Garrincha.”",95
96,Published On 13 Dec 2022,Morocco coach hopes to ‘upset’ France in World Cup semifinal,Walid Regragui says the team was still ‘hungry’ for more success despite them not being ‘favourites’ to lift the trophy.,".Morocco’s coach Walid Regragui said on Tuesday that reaching the World Cup semifinal was not enough for his history-making side and that he hoped to cause an “upset” in their match against reigning champions France on Wednesday. .This is the first time that an Arab and African nation has made it to the semifinal of football’s biggest event in the 92-year history of the tournament. .“We are playing the world champions with many world-class players and a very good coach,” the former national team player told reporters, adding that he wanted to “get rid of the mentality” of remaining satisfied with just reaching a certain level in the tournament. .“We will show great desire and try to pull off an upset. Why not reach the final of the World Cup? We can dream, it doesn’t cost you anything to have dreams,” he added, accompanied by midfielder Ilias Chair. .The coach, who once played for French team Toulouse, said the team was still “hungry” for more success despite not being “favourites” to lift the trophy. .“I don’t know if it will be enough … I know we are not favourites but we are confident,” Regragui added. “We’re going to fight to move on, for the African nations, for the Arab world.” .Morocco defeated top European teams Belgium, Spain and Portugal en route to the semifinal, having conceded only once, and that via an own goal. .Prior to their stunning success in Qatar, the first World Cup held in a Middle Eastern country, the team had reached the knockout stages only once in 1986, when it was eliminated in the round of 16 by Portugal. .The 47-year-old said having “team spirit” was going to be key to preparing for the match tactically and mentally on Wednesday. .“Everyone wants to give their best in every game. We play a collective game with a good spirit,” Regragui said. “For me, that is the most important thing in football.” .The Morocco manager also said the country’s supporters, who have been among the most vocal and visible at the World Cup, will be “very important” for his side’s chance of success on Wednesday. .“We have the best fans in the world … maybe [together] with the Argentinian and Brazilian fans, they are crazy guys,” he said. “They are people who travel from anywhere in the world to support their country.” .“We’re going to play like being at home and that’s the most important thing in the world.” .Chair said it was a “great honour” to play in front of the Moroccan fans and he and his teammates wanted to make them “proud”. .Several key Atlas Lions players, including defender Roman Saisse, are injured and may miss the clash against Les Blues. .However, their French-born manager said the team had an “excellent medical staff” that was providing him with “good news every day”. .“We will have to wait until the last minute. No one is out but no one is definitely in either,” he added. .The semifinal will be played at Al-Bayt Stadium in Al Khor at 10pm local time (19:00 GMT).",96

100,Published On 13 Dec 2022,Is the pressure to win a World Cup getting to Messi?,"Messi displayed uncharacteristic flashes of anger against the Netherlands, including mocking the Dutch manager and player.",".Lionel Messi is two wins away from the elusive World Cup trophy. .The Argentinian maestro has won trophies ranging from the Champions League to La Liga and Copa America. .But, at 35, this is most likely his final World Cup and the last opportunity to win the most coveted trophy in football. Is the pressure to win the elusive trophy getting to the usually mild-mannered forward? .The quarterfinal between the Netherlands and Argentina at the Lusail Stadium was a fractious affair rife with refereeing controversies and heated altercations that resulted in 17 yellow cards. .However, most surprising was the sight of Messi at the centre of many of the fracas, openly mocking, taunting and arguing with Dutch players even after the final whistle had blown. .Messi assisted Argentina’s first goal for Nahuel Molina and then scored a second from the penalty spot. Despite Argentina taking a 2-0 lead, Messi ran over to the Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal and assistant manager Edgar Davids and celebrated his goal by cupping his ears towards them. .The celebration appears to be a nod to former Argentian midfielder Juan Román Riquelme who van Gaal had frequently left out of the Barcelona team in the 2002-2003 season. . .The match reached a fever pitch after the Netherlands clawed a goal back. In the 88th minute, Leandro Paredes booted the ball towards the Dutch dugout and Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk retaliated by thumping him to the ground with his chest. .A last-minute equaliser from the Netherlands took the game to extra time, with Argentina winning the eventual penalty shootout. .Messi still appeared frustrated amid the wild celebrations and was seen arguing with the Dutch management team after the game, appearing to tell van Gaal: “You talk too much.” .“I feel disrespected by van Gaal after his pre-game comments, and some Dutch players spoke too much during the game,” Messi said in a post-match interview. .The Dutch manager had earlier suggested that Messi did little to help his team when they did not have possession. .“Van Gaal says that they play good football, but what he did was put tall people and hit long balls”, Messi added. .Messi continued to vent his frustration in the tunnel, breaking from a live interview to tell Dutch player Wout Weghorst: “What are you looking at, fool? Go on and pass, fool. Go on and pass”. .Weghorst had been brought on as a substitute and scored both goals for the Netherlands. . .Messi, who also argued with the referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz during the game, issued a more measured criticism of his officiating in a post-match interview. .“I don’t want to talk about the referee because you can’t be honest,” Messi said. “If you talk they sanction you. FIFA must think about it, they can’t put a referee who isn’t up to the task for these instances.” .This is not the first time Lionel Messi has shown his temper. In 2011, he smashed a ball into the Bernabeu crowd while playing for Barcelona against Real Madrid. He has also been sent off on three occasions in his career, one of which was for an elbow during his debut for Argentina. .However, the PSG superstar has plenty of experience in managing his anger and is often on the receiving end of provocations by opposition players. .During Argentina’s 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in the group stages, Saudi defender Ali Al-Bulayhi slapped Messi on the back and told him: “You will not win”. .On that occasion, the midfielder showed a typically cool head and only exchanged a few quiet words with the player. .As Argentina edge closer to the World Cup final, Messi will understand that he is within touching distance of completing the trophy cabinet. .For that to happen, a cool-headed Messi is far more beneficial for Argentina than one who loses his temper and risks being sent off.",100
101,Published On 13 Dec 2022,The boisterous crowd pushing Argentina towards World Cup glory,The Albiceleste fans have been among the most exuberant supporters seen at the World Cup.,".Doha, Qatar – Billions of people around the world have witnessed the unbridled passion of supporters of the 32 teams participating in the football World Cup 2022 in Qatar. .Fans of Morocco, Brazil, Cameroon, Mexico and other countries have been the subject of endless media attention over their colourful costumes, songs, dances, chants and stadium choreography aimed at helping their team’s chances at the World Cup. .At the very pinnacle of football fandom, the energy and enthusiasm of Argentinian supporters have lit up their team’s five games played to date in the tournament. .With drums, trumpets and untiring vocal chords, the Albiceleste’s supporters have brought their decades-long dedication to football to the stadiums of Qatar. .The atmosphere is nothing short of exhilarating when Argentina’s army of supporters, dressed in white and blue, boisterously belt out the lyrics of famous football chants, such as Vamos Argentina (Go Argentina), and the re-adapted footballing version of Argentinian band La Mosca’s song Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar (Boys, We Have Our Hopes Up Again). .Sung during the group stages inside and outside stadiums, the lyrics go: “In Argentina I was born, in the land of Diego [Maradona] and Lionel [Messi].” .Regardless of whether they score, concede, possess the ball or lose it, the deafening sound of the Argentinian fans is a permanent fixture through the 90 minutes of play, and beyond. It is relentless. .“As Argentinians, we are mad about football and creating a good atmosphere,” said Victor Ramos, 47, an Argentina supporter. “A welcoming environment for the players is our way of helping the team. The support from fans is a very important part of any sport, not just football.” .The expression of Argentinian enthusiasm witnessed at the World Cup can be traced back to the undying attachment to local football clubs in Argentina, Jessica Costa from Buenos Aires said. .“On Sundays, some people go to church, while others go to the stadiums,” said the 28-year-old, who is studying Arabic in Doha. .“We love our local teams from an early age,” she told Al Jazeera, explaining how supporters in Argentina arrive up to three hours before matches kick off. . .Such support demonstrates “the love you have for the players. And the same thing goes for the Argentinian team,” she said. .“It’s a big part of our culture and history.” .Argentina’s embassy in Doha reported that between 35,000 and 40,000 Argentinians travelled to Qatar in hopes of seeing their team lift the coveted trophy after 36 years, according to AFP news agency. .While many of the Argentinians who could afford to travel to the World Cup are more well to do, there are multiple stories of people with far less who have made the journey, including putting off buying homes and cars to do so, according to a Reuters news agency report. .There is also no shortage of support for the Albiceleste among fans from other countries, including India. .Indian citizens can be seen in large numbers at World Cup games clad in Argentina and Messi jerseys, and holding posters of the legendary Maradona. .Argentinian football also has problems with supporters, particularly the “barra bravas” – a network of organised football fans who are known for both their fanatical support of their teams and their violence. .Compared with football hooligans in Europe, the barra bravas are said to be present across Latin American football teams and among several top local football clubs in Argentina, and have been linked with illegal street businesses, intimidation and fighting, including some that has been deadly. .Earlier this year, the Buenos Aires city government said it was cooperating with Qatar authorities to prevent some 3,000 barra brava members and thousands of other violent fans from entering stadiums during the World Cup. .Costa, the Argentinian student and Qatar resident, said it would be wise to keep the barra bravas away from stadiums everywhere, including at the World Cup. .“They create really problems,” she said. “At the World Cup, you want to create an atmosphere for families also, where we can cheer and sing together all united. But with these people (barra bravas) there is violence – they start fights, bring knives. It’s not a healthy environment.” .Roberto Oscar, a communications specialist also from Buenos Aires, told Al Jazeera that while he is glad steps had been taken to restrict the barra bravas and to prevent hooliganism at the World Cup, the presence of fanatical fans at games does “increase the enjoyment”. .“Before, the atmosphere is easy and peaceful. But when they come, that’s when the party starts,” Oscar said. “It’s like a crazy spectacle.” .After booking a semifinal spot for Wednesday against Croatia, more Argentinian supporters are expected to arrive in Qatar in hopes of seeing their team advance to the final, and star player Messi finally winning the one major trophy that has eluded him. .“I think we have a good chance (against Croatia),” Costa said. “We have been improving every game. I don’t want to think about losing. But, if it happens, I will still be very proud of the team.”",101

Head-to-head: Argentina wins: 2, Croatia wins: 2, Draw: 1 .Argentina .Croatia .Argentina face Croatia in a World Cup semifinal that pits South American flair against the guile of Luka Modric and a remarkable fighting spirit. .At Lusail Stadium, Lionel Messi, now 35, will attempt to guide Argentina into the final for the second time in eight years against the beaten finalists in 2018. .Messi, who suffered defeat to Germany in the 2014 final, is desperate to crown an extraordinary career by finally winning the World Cup and emulating another Argentinian legend, the late Diego Maradona. .The Paris Saint-Germain forward was a pivotal figure in Friday’s stormy quarterfinal win over the Netherlands, when a record 18 yellow cards were shown and players from both sides were involved in a melee as the referee fought to regain control. .The match ended with Argentina players appearing to taunt their distraught Dutch opponents before sprinting away to celebrate after a penalty shootout win. . .Even the normally mild-mannered Messi was caught up in the bad blood, shouting abuse at Dutch players while he was being interviewed after the game. .A question mark hangs over veteran Angel Di Maria and his fitness, with the 34-year-old having largely been used as a substitute in the tournament despite recovering from injury. .Messi, at 35, playing likely his last World Cup, is desperate to land the one major title missing from his extensive collection but he is also carrying the weight of the nation on his shoulders. .Croatia, who beat Japan and pre-tournament favourites Brazil in penalty shootouts to reach the last four, have not won a knockout game in normal time at a major tournament since they came third at the 1998 World Cup. .Despite doing it the hard way, the country of 3.9 million people surprised the football world by reaching the final four years ago, where France crushed their dreams with a 4-2 win. .Croatia, with Real Madrid playmaker Modric still the leader on the pitch at the age of 37, have again defied the odds to stand on the brink of a second successive final. .This Croatian team is like a sponge. Led by Luka Modrić, they absorb tremendous pressure and just when you think they will implode, they wrangle themselves for one final squeeze. .With no players suspended and no injury concerns following the return of defender Borna Sosa, Zlatko Dalic’s team is brimming with confidence and ready for more. .Super-sub Bruno Petkovic, who scored the equaliser against Brazil, could earn back his starting spot over Andrej Kramaric while Mario Pasalic is expected to keep his in attack. .Tuesday night will be a clash between two midfields that don’t hesitate from a scrap. Goals may be at a premium, but with Messi and Modric on the pitch, the genius quotient of the game will be high.",103
104,Published On 13 Dec 2022,World Cup win for Lionel Messi is only a ‘matter of time’,"From Bangladeshis to Bahrainis, the Argentinian superstar’s fans are in Doha praying their hero will lift the World Cup.",".Doha, Qatar – When 18-year-old Abdur Rahman stepped inside Lusail Stadium ahead of Argentina’s quarterfinal against the Netherlands on Friday night, he broke down. And at the first sight of Lionel Messi warming up on the pitch, his heart began pounding. .It had been Rahman’s biggest dream: to see Messi play ever since he first became familiar with modern football’s biggest name in 2010. .“I began following Messi [on television] at the 2010 World Cup, when I was six,” Rahman told Al Jazeera, pausing to collect his thoughts. “I could never imagine I would be inside the same stadium and be breathing the same air as him one day.” .The engineering student from Bahrain said he had been saving money for six months for this day. He came prepared with a Messi T-shirt, an Argentina flag tied around his neck and painted on his cheek, and “Oh Argentina Vamos” on his lips. .“I love the Argentina team and I feel like I’m one of them so I have learned their anthems and practiced their celebrations,” Rahman said before standing up to wave and sing with thousands of Argentines around him. . .Argentina have had some of the biggest support inside stadiums during this World Cup. That’s partly the luck of the draw — they’ve played most of their matches at Lusail Stadium, the biggest venue for the tournament, which can seat nearly 89,000 people. But while most of their supporters have Messi’s name and number 10 on their backs, they don’t all come from the same country or even the same continent. .Muhammad Adil and his Messi-loving family are from Kerala, India. They landed in Qatar just hours before the quarterfinal. .Adil and his three siblings, carrying a large Argentina flag, got seats behind the goal. After more than two hours of high-octane action that included four goals, 17 yellow cards, one red card, an on-field brawl and a penalty shootout, Argentina prevailed. .The siblings were overjoyed. .“Messi is my happiness,” Adil said with a big toothy grin. “It was surreal seeing him from a few hundred metres away, and I will always carry this moment in my heart.” Adil and his family returned home a few hours after the game but said they would cheer Argentina on from Kerala, a southern Indian state which Adil said was “crazy about football”. .South American football teams, in particular, have always enjoyed great following in the state – as is the case across South Asia – and the World Cup is greeted with fervour. . .But Messi’s appeal isn’t limited to a few parts of the world. It spreads across borders and unites strangers, and it was on display when Argentina’s place in the semifinals was confirmed with Lautaro Martinez’s successful penalty kick on December 9. .Strangers seated next to each other jumped, high-fived and hugged each other as the stadium erupted in celebration. As Messi walked close to the fans with his arms aloft, his admirers bowed before him and chanted his name in unison. .Among them was Haopeng Wang, from China, who kept his head down until the 35-year-old football star turned around to join his teammates. “Messi is my god,” Wang said, patting his chest in a rhythmic motion, as if to slow down his heartbeat and make himself believe that he wasn’t dreaming. .“He [Messi] made a wonderful assist, and showed his magic,” the 22-year-old said, before putting his hands up to say he was “too emotional to speak”. .Disbelief gave way to raucous and passionate celebrations as fans made their way out of the stadium. The one title that has eluded Argentina’s decorated captain was now two wins away and the significance was not lost on his admirers. .A group of Bangladeshi fans filed out of the venue with flags of their own country and that of their hero. Their chants in Bengali were punctuated with Messi’s name. Fakhrul Islam, one of the fans, explained that they were singing, “Messi needs the World Cup and the World Cup needs Messi.” .“It will be a shame for football if Messi doesn’t win a World Cup in his career, and all our prayers are with him,” he added, holding his hands up in prayer and looking skywards. .Others, like Yasin from Sudan, seemed more confident that the Rosario-born icon would deliver Argentina’s third World Cup title. He said he had travelled more than 2,000km (1,242 miles) to watch the “greatest ever” footballer, and won’t go home without seeing him lift the trophy. .As tens of thousands of spectators made a beeline for stadium exits, Yasin stood still with a sage-like smile and a handmade placard that read in Spanish: “Messi is here, World Cup is a matter of time.”",104
105,Published On 13 Dec 2022,France not underestimating Morocco threat in World Cup semifinal,France defender Raphael Varane says the World Cup title holders will not ‘fall into the trap’ of overconfidence when facing Morocco in the semifinal match.,".France will “not fall into” the trap of overconfidence when they take on the tournament surprise-stars Morocco in their semifinal showdown on Wednesday, French defender Raphael Varane has insisted. .Though Morocco has stunned the footballing world by eliminating Spain and Portugal in the tournament’s knockout phase — and in the process becoming the first African and Arab team to qualify for a World Cup semifinal — France’s Les Bleus remain strong favourites to retain their title this year. .The French have already achieved the target set by their country’s football federation of getting to the last four teams, but France’s defender Varane said on Monday that his side were hungry for a place in Sunday’s final and they would not be complacent when taking on Morocco. .“We have enough experience in the team to not fall into that trap,” Varane, one of the survivors of France’s victorious 2018 World Cup campaign, said when asked about overconfidence ahead of the Morocco match. .“We know Morocco are not here by chance. It is up to us experienced players to make sure everyone is prepared for another battle,” he said. .“It is not easy to get to a World Cup semifinal so we are very pleased, but the only real objective is to win it,” he added. .“That was always the aim.” .Fellow France defender Jules Kounde praised the Morocco team’s performance at the tournament. .“It is remarkable to have only conceded one goal at this stage of the competition, all the more so given the teams they have faced,” Kounde said. .“They are very compact, with lines that are close together, and they leave little time for the player on the ball to organise himself,” he said. .“They also run really fast, so we’ll need to play with few touches, move the ball around quickly and try to unbalance them by moving from one side to the other.” .Morocco’s run has been stunning. .They beat Portugal 1-0 in the quarterfinals after dumping out Spain on penalties in the last 16. They also beat Belgium and drew with Croatia during the group phase and have conceded just a single goal, from an own goal, in their five matches so far in the tournament. .  .Morocco’s Azzedine Ounahi has been at the heart of the team’s success, tirelessly stamping his authority on the midfield and emerging as one of the revelations of the entire tournament and even catching the eye of Spain’s former coach Luis Enrique, following the Spanish side’s shootout loss to the Moroccans. Enrique was sacked by Spain after the Morocco defeat. .“I was surprised by [Ounahi]. My goodness, where does that boy come from?” Enrique said, in awe of the midfielder’s “spectacular” display. “He plays really well. I was very surprised. He hasn’t stopped running, he must be exhausted.” .Only 18 months ago, Ounahi was toiling away in the French third-tier football league. Now with Ligue 1 club Angers, it will not be long before he departs following his World Cup display. .Ounahi, who has excelled alongside teammate and midfield enforcer Sofyan Amrabat, is a reported target for Barcelona. Amrabat, 26, is also said to be on Liverpool’s radar. .“Is the phone ringing? It’s ringing quite a lot,” Angers chairman Said Chabane told France’s RMC radio station of the interest in Ounahi and countryman Sofiane Boufal, who has also started every game in Qatar. .“You know very well that we can’t hold back a player who wants to leave,” he said. .A relative unknown outside his homeland and France, few are unlikely to forget Ounahi’s name after this World Cup and the coming semifinal game against the reigning French side.",105

However, we want more,” Dalic told reporters. .“We are playing the great Argentina — a terrific team led by Lionel Messi. They are highly motivated, but they’re under greater pressure than Croatia at this particular moment in time,” he said. .“We have analysed our opponent. We know how they play. We know where they want to take the game, and we’re preparing for them,” he added. .Dalic said his team was ready to take on the Argentinians, and his squad’s skill and “strength of character” had carried them to the semifinals and he hoped it would take them further. .“We shall not adapt to our opponent too much. We know their strengths and weaknesses, but will continue to play our own game, and I hope it will yield the right result,” he said. .The semifinal match at Lusail Iconic Stadium will pit two of the greatest to wear a number 10 jersey against each other, with Argentina’s Lionel Messi, 35, and Croatia’s Luka Modric, 37, vying to be crowned champion for the first time at what is likely to be their final World Cup appearances. .Stamina and mental endurance will be crucial to success on the pitch. .Croatia and Argentina went through extra time and penalties in their quarterfinal victories over Brazil and Netherlands, while seven of the eighth knockout games Croatia played over the last four major international tournaments have gone to extra time, with the 4-2 defeat to France in the final of the 2018 World Cup the only exception as it concluded in 90 minutes. .Argentina also trained on Monday, and Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said his team expects a tough game against Croatia. .Argentina will also be without two players because of suspension: left-back Marcos Acuña and right-back Gonzalo Montiel. Acuña is the bigger miss, having impressed since coming into the team after the stunning loss to Saudi Arabia in the group stage, and he is likely to be replaced by Tagliafico. .“We expect a tough match and it is against a really good team. They are a proper team and they play as a team,” Scaloni told reporters in a pre-match conference in Doha on Monday. .“They are going to make things challenging for us,” Scaloni said. .“They have a specific playing style. I don’t think they are going to change that. It is neither defensive nor attacking,” he said. .“We have our system and our style. We won’t change our style.” .Dalic, who said Croatia was free from injuries ahead of the game, also said he hoped the match against the Argentinians would not be as emotionally charged or ill-tempered as their quarterfinal qualification match against the Netherlands. .Eighteen yellow cards and one red car were handed out to Dutch and Argentinian players in a performance marred by disciplinary violations from both sides throughout. .Croatia have also previously been on the receiving end of Argentinian temper. .Following Croatia’s group stage win at the 2018 World Cup, then-Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli refused to shake Dalic’s hand. .Dalic said he holds no grudges. .“I understand the actors involved and the expectations were high back then [in 2018]. It happens and we shall not hold any grudges,” Dalic said. .“I don’t get angry at anyone in an emotional state of mind. Argentina against Netherlands was also quite feisty and difficult with many non-football-related behaviours. I really hope this will not be the case tomorrow,” he said. .“Tomorrow’s match is a great match for Argentina as well as us. The stakes are high for both and a spot in the final is at stake,” he said. .Dalic’s advice to his players and their few fans in Qatar was to enjoy the game. .“I always say to our fans and players to enjoy the football,” he said. .“Each of us has to enjoy the work, the profession we are doing. Only if players are happy can they be what they are.” .",106

They had 15 minutes to gather as much footage and photos before security escorted everyone out. .The 35-year-old star said before the tournament that this will be his last World Cup, which has only led to increased attention. .He has won every major club and national team title, except the World Cup. He came close in 2014, but the South Americans lost to Germany in the final. .The “little magician” is set to equal another record tomorrow.

They are a proper team and they play as a team,” Scaloni told reporters in a pre-match conference in Doha. “They are going to make things challenging for us.” .“They have a specific playing style. I don’t think they are going to change that. It is neither defensive nor attacking,” the former Argentine national team player said. “They have very good players. And they have a long-lasting football tradition.” .“We have our system and our style. We won’t change our style. We know they have excellent players. They have players that can hurt us. I won’t mention names,” Scaloni added. .Argentina have not had the easiest of routes to the semifinals. They were shocked by Saudi Arabia in their opening match, losing 2-1 to the Green Falcons. But they have upped their performances after the shock upset. .Since their opening game defeat, the South Americans have only conceded three goals in four matches. Against the Netherlands in the quarterfinals, they were 2-0 up after a Lionel Messi penalty. A brilliant defence-splitting pass from the Argentine captain had earlier set Nahuel Molina up for the first goal. .But the Netherlands launched an unlikely comeback, scoring two goals in the dying minutes of the game — their equaliser came in the 10th minute of added time. .The feisty game, which saw 17 players receiving yellow cards, went into extra time before the South Americans won 4-3 on penalties. Two-time champions Argentina will hope to avoid a repeat against opponents who have mastered the art of taking games deep and winning in extra time or penalty shootouts. Croatia have won five of their last six World Cup knockout games — in each case by taking the match beyond 90 minutes. .“We trust (Emiliano) Martinez so much,” Argentina defender Nicolas Tagliafico said. “But we can never be too calm regardless of having a really good goalkeeper.” .“You can practice penalty shootouts but once you are on the pitch with thousands of fans and emotions running high it is not the same,” he said. .The two teams have locked horns five times previously, with each side picking up two wins and the fifth game ending in a draw. That includes two encounters at the World Cup. .In 1998, Argentina beat Croatia 1-0. Two decades later, in 2018, Croatia got their revenge, beating La Albiceleste 3-0. .But both those games were in the group stages: On Tuesday the stakes will be higher than any the two sides have experienced while facing off against each other. .Croatia — if they win — would become the first back-to-back World Cup finalists since Brazil in 2002. But in Messi, Argentina have a player who can unlock any defence at any moment. .The seven-time Balon d’Or winner is eyeing his second World Cup final, after his team lost to Germany in 2014. The World Cup trophy is the only key title missing from his collection, which includes every big club and national team title. .“He is the one pushing us. He is the one motivating us,” Tagliafico, the left-back who plays in the French league for Lyon, said. “We are really lucky to have Messi as our captain.”",110

But standing between the team and a shot at the trophy is the footballing superpower and reigning champions France, who the Atlas Lions will meet in the semi-finals on Wednesday. .If they manage to overcome France, coach Walid Regragui’s side will then be pitted against either Croatia, runners-up in 2018, or Argentina, 1986 World Cup winners, for world football’s biggest prize on Sunday. .Few would have believed it was possible Morocco would still be in the mix at this stage of the World Cup when the tournament kicked off in Qatar on November 20. .But now optimism is surging through Regragui’s team and among its throngs of supporters, in Qatar, Morocco and across the world. .Can Morocco upset the odds again and conclude their fairytale run in glory? .The Atlas Lions have stunned the footballing world with their magical showing at the World Cup – becoming the first Arab and African country to reach the tournament’s last four throughout its 92 years of existence. .They topped their group after beating Belgium and Canada and drawing against Croatia before stunning Spain in the last 16 with a dramatic win on penalties. .Portugal came and went next, with Youssef En Nesyri’s soaring header securing a historic 1-0 victory for his side, sending them through to the semis and sparking an outpouring of joy among supporters scattered throughout the world. .Morocco will adopt the same tactics against France as they have throughout the tournament. .Regragui’s side will sit deep and hope to blunt the world champion’s array of attacking talent, including superstar forward Kylian Mbappe, while posing a threat on the counterattack. .Morocco’s defence has been resolute in Qatar with just one goal conceded in five matches. .France, who are looking to become the World Cup’s first back-to-back finalists since Brazil in 2002, will provide their toughest test yet. .Mbappe, whose five goals make him the tournament’s leading scorer, is capable of unlocking any backline while fellow forwards Olivier Giroud and Antoine Griezmann have been on fine form in Qatar. . .Al Jazeera’s AI robot, Kashef, has crunched the numbers and concluded Morocco face an uphill battle. .Kashef is giving Morocco a 32-percent chance of beating France and making it to the final. .Should the Atlas Lions do so, they have a 43 percent chance of lifting the trophy if they take on Croatia and a 33 percent chance if it is Argentina at Lusail Stadium on December 18. . .Coach Regragui has said his players should not just aspire to reach Sunday’s final but to win it. .“In one press conference three or four matches ago, I was asked if we could win the World Cup.

If you don’t dream, you don’t get anywhere,” Regragui told reporters on Saturday after the team’s victory over Portugal. .“It doesn’t cost you anything to have dreams. European countries have been used to winning the World Cup,” he added, describing his side as the “Rocky Balboa” of this year’s tournament. .Morocco fans, enraptured by their side’s efforts, certainly believe the team stands on the cusp of glory. .Tens of thousands of supporters arrived in Qatar ahead of the Atlas Lions’ last-16 clash and again before the quarter-final. They created a raucous atmosphere during the matches and Wednesday’s clash at the Al Bayt Stadium is expected to feel like a home match for the North African side. .“First time [in the semi-finals]. First time. Wow, wow. History is made,” said Lubna, who came to Qatar from Rabat just for the quarterfinal against Portugal. “Adios Spain, adios Portugal, adios whoever is next. We can win it. Morocco, yes.” .“I still can’t believe it. It doesn’t feel real to me,” Hassan Fadlaoui, 39, said. “It’s been an amazing journey for our people in these past few weeks … something for so many people to feel better about.” .Reem, Najma and Lubna were three more Moroccan supporters who travelled to Doha just for the match against Portugal. .“We’re going back tomorrow morning, but we’ll be back for the semifinal,” Reem said. “Work can take a back seat.

113,Published On 12 Dec 2022,The disabled freestyle footballer wowing World Cup fans,"Juanro Aguiló was born with only one, incomplete arm. Today he’s an ace freestyle footballer and motivational speaker.",".Doha, Qatar – Juanro Aguiló spun a football with the fused fingers on his right hand as he came out of a Qatar Foundation building near Education City Stadium. .Fans walked to the stadium along the barricaded pathways in front of the building, occasionally glancing at Aguiló’s tricks with the Al Rihla — the World Cup’s official football.  .Fifteen minutes later, he took to a stage across the barricade, with Laura, a Venezuelan athlete, as more of the fans pouring into the stadium stopped by and cheered, wowed by their freestyle football moves — a combination of juggling, dance, and acrobatics. .At stadiums around Qatar, the biggest names in the sport have mesmerised the world over the past three weeks at football’s showpiece event. But at a World Cup whose motto is “Now is all”, this was Aguiló’s moment — one which captured the essence of the skills and joy that make football the “beautiful game”. .Aguiló was born in 1985 in Santiago, Chile, with a rare condition called phocomelia, which caused an underdeveloped right arm and a missing left arm. “I started juggling the ball when I was seven,” he told Al Jazeera. But at the time, he did not know that what he was doing just for kicks was part of a sport played by both football legends and non-footballers. .Looking for a better future for Aguiló and his younger sister, his civil engineer father and school teacher mother moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1997. Two years later, the father got a new job in Miami, US, and the family moved there. They stayed in Miami until 2001. .It was during those teenage years as a frequent exile that Aguiló — who once wanted to take up taekwondo but stayed away because of his inability to block kicks with his one, underdeveloped arm — truly discovered freestyle football. It was a sport he could practice alone in a limited space. .“A friend and I downloaded [former Brazil star] Ronaldinho’s freestyle videos from some pirate websites, and we watched them a lot before training ourselves to get motivated,” he recalled. Then in 2007, Aguiló participated in a freestyle football competition in Chile, an opportunity that introduced him to others practising the sport. .While his motivations have changed over time, “the main one was trying to find my limits and to push boundaries; to be a better athlete but importantly a better person.” The sport gave him “perseverance, dedication and discipline”, the qualities “you can use not only in sports but in relationships, work, and life,” he said. “I’m happy I discovered this sport at a young age.” .Success in freestyle gave Aguiló the confidence to become more outgoing — he has always been “really koo koo koo koorious [curious],” he said, giggling. .Today, he’s also a popular motivational speaker. As with football, he did it the hard way through dogged practice. Aguiló said he spent weeks on YouTube analysing what clicked for top motivational speakers — their style, entry onstage, delivery of jokes, use of silence, speech length and finishing lines “until I discovered the winning formula.” .He has now shared lessons from his life in nine countries. When he visits schools to talk to young children, he “brings the ball in the middle of the talk as a surprise”. Then, he showcases his freestyle skills “to encourage them to face life without fear”. .Aguiló, who lives in Matanzas — a village in central Chile — with his wife Consu, now practices freestyle football every other day for two hours. “That’s enough for me. I did more in the past.” .Though he himself does not struggle much with mobility, Aguiló said he had been impressed by the sight of people in wheelchairs getting “good access to the city and stadiums” in Qatar. .That’s not something people with disabilities can take for granted, he said. “In some countries, people are unhelpful to the disabled; they just invisibilise them,” he said. .In Doha, though, Aguiló has a ready audience — half an hour after his street performance, he was back inside the building, sweaty, and making a small crowd of Qatar Foundation officials smile and laugh with his jokes. .When an Al Jazeera video journalist asked him to look at the camera, he distorted his facial muscles to grimace, glower and pout to offer a range of available expressions. Seconds later, though, he was back to business with the ball — it is what he knows best. .Aguiló, who has delivered a TED talk titled Dare to be Different, said his main message to those who follow his freelance football or message is to embrace diversity and stay unique. .“Be happy with what you have and look at the bright side of life, and always try to expand good habits, because good habits get replicated,” he said. “Money can help, but in the end, it’s all about attitude.”",113
114,Published On 12 Dec 2022,Can Ronaldo rediscover his purpose after World Cup exit?,"At 37, he’s not scoring as much as he did 10 years ago. Can being on the bench bring out the best of what he can offer now?",".Athletes are the most self-actualised species on the planet. Guts and tenacity take them to the top of Maslow’s pyramid but it’s the heightened sense of purpose that keeps them there. .An unwavering conviction that this is what they are meant in life. It isn’t a career as much as it is a calling. Which is why walking away can be so hard. .Retirement is like death for athletes and 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo has been slowly dying in that sense over the last few years. .The last-16 match against Switzerland, where he started from the bench, felt like the final nail in the coffin. .Barring injuries and suspension, it was only the third time in his Portugal career that Ronaldo did not make the starting XI for a competitive game. Only once before has he made a shorter appearance for Portugal and that came in a Euro 2004 group match against Russia where he played just 12 minutes. .In the 16 league games he played for Manchester United this season before leaving, he started just four. .Switzerland was not a one-off. It happened again in the quarterfinal against Morocco. .It wasn’t the fact that he had started all of Portugal’s group games before the Switzerland one that made his benching so seismic. It felt so because it was the national team, the one place where his place, his stature and his importance have never been under threat. .“Quite apart from the fact that he is the captain, he has helped elevate Portuguese football to a different level and he’s the biggest star in terms of media glow that they’ve ever had to deal with,” European football expert Andy Brassell told Al Jazeera. .Ahead of the World Cup, many felt that the noise around Ronaldo and his relationship with Manchester United could have a destabilising effect on Portugal’s campaign. .But Brassell said they are used to dealing with the frenzy, pointing to Euro 2008 when Ronaldo was pushing for a move to Real Madrid and the 2014 World Cup when there were major concerns over his fitness. .He added that Ronaldo’s omission from the starting XI can be put down to his on-field showings: “dispirit performances” in Portugal’s opening game against Ghana and how they looked a better side against Uruguay when Bruno Fernandes was pulling the strings. .“The interesting thing was that what happened against South Korea [substitution]… that led to that Fernando Santos [coach] public telling-off which I don’t think has happened before. Santos had never told Ronaldo off in public before and that and it felt like a huge step,” Brassell said. .Santos is a man who acceded the touchline to Ronaldo at the Euro 2016 final. After going off injured in the 25th minute, Ronaldo spent most of the second half standing next to Santos, shouting instructions to the players. .Ronaldo’s actions in recent months – refusing to come on as a substitute against Tottenham, claiming and celebrating a goal against Uruguay that wasn’t his, airing his grievances in a tell-all interview – have been attributed partly to his ego. .But it’s more than just that. It stems from Ronaldo’s inability to accept the fact that he is no longer the player he once was. .It’s one thing to be unwilling to pass on the baton, it’s another to shield it with such ferocity. .Ronaldo’s introduction against Switzerland was met with deafening cheers in the stands. .He had a smile on his face as he looked around the stadium, perhaps coming to terms with the fact that this has become a reality: a 16-minute cameo off the bench in a World Cup knockout game when his side was 5-1 up. .Ronaldo remains the protagonist of the show but the stage has changed. As has football. A centre-forward’s job today isn’t just to put the ball in the back of the net. They are now the first line of defence and an important cog in the team’s buildup. .“Obviously, he’s very fit but I’m not sure he’s 100 percent football fit. I don’t think he can get around the pitch and make Portugal as formidable as they were against Switzerland,” Brassell said. . .Football’s tactical evolution may have left him behind but it has also left the back door open for him. The five-substitution rule has effectively made it a game of 16 versus 16. The hyper-specificity of roles means that managers have now begun picking players with specific phases of the game in mind. .It’s not the role he may have envisaged for himself but Ronaldo could be the ultimate super-sub. .A big gripe with Ronaldo is how he demands the ball from his teammates and forces them to build around him. That’s what makes him the ideal out-ball in the final 15 minutes. He can stretch tiring defences with his smart movement and is a constant presence for them to contend with in the box. .Ronaldo is an enforcer, a player whose game is defined by disruption and power. He rarely impacts the rhythm of the game but he’s the one who makes the beat drop. Since 2020, he’s averaged a goal contribution every 100 minutes for Portugal. That was 120 minutes for Manchester United last season. The numbers don’t warrant a start but would make for an effective substitution. .Ronaldo would do well to focus his attention on Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede’s career was considered over when he tore his ACL at 35 and moved to LA Galaxy in 2018. .Two years later, he returned to AC Milan and became the spiritual leader of a young team undergoing a rebuild. His minutes were regulated to maximise his utility and not hamper the development of the upcoming players. .He started less than half the games in the season they won the Serie A but Ibrahimovic’s contributions were sizeable: 17 goals in all competitions. .Once the shock of being dropped from back-to-back World Cup matches – and being knocked out by Morocco – settles, Ronaldo would do well to recognise that an opportunity exists for him to polish a legacy that has taken a battering over the past couple of years. .Ronaldo said his World Cup dream ended after the shock against Morocco. .It could be the end for Ronaldo.

European countries have been used to winning the World Cup.” .France roar into Wednesday’s match having vanquished England in a 2-1 quarterfinal thriller on Sunday. Over the weekend, officials announced French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Doha for the match against Morocco. .“The details of the trip remain to be settled, of course, but he had made this commitment,” French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said on Franceinfo radio on Sunday. .Macron’s office stated last month that he would travel to the Qatar 2022 World Cup if Les Bleus progressed in the semifinal round. .“Congratulations to [Les] Bleus!” Macron wrote on Twitter early on Sunday following the team’s win over England. .“The whole country is behind you: We will go to the end together.

There’s no hiding from it, it hurts and it’ll take some time to get over it but that’s part of sport.” .England has not won a World Cup since 1966. . .The English captain’s missed penalty came as the Three Lions frantically attempted to claw themselves back into the match after Aurelien Tchouameni and Olivier Giroud gave Les Bleus a slim 2-1 lead. .It was Kane’s second penalty kick of the match.

I’ll never shrink from a battle and I have never given up on that dream.” .But, he added: “Unfortunately, that dream ended yesterday.” .Ronaldo has not specifically commented on his future, but the 37-year-old has been widely expected to retire from international level football after Qatar, the fifth World Cup in which he had competed. .Controversy had swirled around the Portuguese skipper in recent matches after the team’s head coach Fernando Santos opted to bench Ronaldo in Portugal’s 6-1 steamrolling of Switzerland, apparently after he had reacted angrily while being substituted against South Korea during the group stages of the tournament. .Reports later circulated that the legendary football star had threatened to walk out on Seleção das Quinas amid their short-lived run in the elimination round in Qatar. Portugal ultimately denied those reports. .On Saturday, Santos again benched Ronaldo during the match against Morocco and started his replacement, 21-year-old Goncalo Ramos, who netted three goals in the clash with Switzerland. Ronaldo was substituted on in the game’s second half. .“I’ve always been just one more [Portuguese] fighting for everyone’s goal,” Ronaldo said in his Instagram post. .“I would never turn my back on my teammates or my country.” .Ronaldo said he planned now to “let everyone draw their own conclusions”. .He concluded his post by thanking Portugal and host nation Qatar. .“For now. There’s not much else to say. Thank you, Portugal. Thank you, Qatar. The dream was beautiful as long as it lasted.” .Ronaldo exits Qatar without a club team as well. .He was dumped by Manchester United with “immediate effect” after conducting a blistering interview on the eve of the World Cup, in which he sharply criticised manager Erik ten Hag. .Portugal, who has never won a World Cup, now must set their eyes on the 2024 European Championship in Germany, the next big football tournament on the international circuit. .There was no love lost between Moroccan fans and Ronaldo however. .“Where Cristiano Ronaldo is? Do you know where? In my pocket,” a young Moroccan fan told Al Jazeera following the team’s win over Portugal. .United States rapper French Montana, who has Moroccan roots, also trolled Ronaldo on social media over the weekend. .“Ronaldo u had your time g … it’s Morocco time,” the Bronx rapper wrote on Saturday. .Morocco’s semifinal place makes them both the first African and Arab team to make it into the last four at a World Cup. .On Wednesday, Morocco will face reigning World Cup champions France in the tournament’s semifinal round at Al Bayt Stadium. .",117

The semifinal losers will face each other for third place. .The existing ball, introduced with technology to assist in tracking and helping referee decisions, has been used so far across the group stages and initial knockout rounds of the World Cup tournament. .The Al Hilm, with a gold base design and triangular pattern, pays tribute to the deserts surrounding the host nation’s capital city, Doha, FIFA said in a statement. .“Al Hilm represents a beacon of light on the power of sport and football to bring the world together,” Adidas General Manager Nick Craggs said in a statement. .“Millions will tune in from almost every country around the globe, united by their passion for the game.

119,Published On 12 Dec 2022,Confident Croatia aims to end Lionel Messi’s World Cup dream,"Fresh from Brazil victory, the Croatia side is confident as they prepare for World Cup semifinal against Argentina.",".Croatia has already ended the World Cup dream of Brazil’s Neymar; now they hope to do the same to Argentina’s Lionel Messi. .But, the Croat side will not attempt to stop the Argentina superstar by man-marking him, instead they will focus on immobilising the entire team in their World Cup semifinal on Tuesday, members of the team said. .“We don’t have a specific plan yet for stopping Messi and usually we don’t concentrate on stopping one player but the entire team,” Croatia’s striker Bruno Petkovic told a news conference on Sunday. .“We will try to stop them as a team and not with man-marking. Argentina are not only Messi, they have a number of great players. We have to stop the entire Argentina team,” he said. .Croatia are bidding to make it to the final for the second World Cup in a row after losing in the 2018 showcase match to France, and with no players suspended and no injury concerns, the Croatian side is brimming with confidence. .They stunned tournament favourites Brazil in the quarterfinals after going a goal down in extra time but dug deep to bounce back with a late equaliser and forced a penalty shootout that they ended up winning. .Brazil’s star striker Neymar was left in tears after the game when Croatia emerged victorious 4-2 on penalties. .Croatia is now on a mission to do the same with Messi’s team and prevent him from winning the one major trophy that has eluded him — a World Cup. .Croatia’s midfield comprising captain Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic will be key to dictating the pace, as they did against Brazil, and Croatia defender Josip Juranovic said on Sunday that the three were utterly dependable. .“Mateo, Luka and Marcelo are the best Croatia midfield in history. I don’t think it can be repeated. When you pass them the ball it is safer than having your money in the bank,” Juranovic said. .“I don’t think we need to fear anybody. We need to look at ourselves to play our best game,” he said. .“I would say the secret of our success is our togetherness, our unity. The fact that we act and play as a family.” .Seven-time Ballon D’Or winner Messi has so far been the driving force for Argentina, who also needed penalties after squandering a two-goal lead against the Dutch in their quarterfinal match. .Messi has been inspired during Argentina’s run to the tournament semifinals, scoring four goals in five games, and it appears he has taken it upon himself to lead his country to a World Cup triumph. .Argentina last reached the final in 2014 — losing 1-0 to Germany at the Maracana Stadium in Brazil. That was as close as Messi has come to lifting football’s biggest trophy and he is just one game away from having another shot at it. .With Messi at the helm, Argentina came into the World Cup as one of the favourites but they face a big roadblock in the form of Croatia. .With a never-say-die attitude — even when the odds are stacked heavily against them — the disciplined Croat side are now deservedly in their second-straight World Cup semifinal, and underestimating them would come at Argentina’s risk. .The Argentinians, looking for their first World Cup title since Diego Maradona’s 1986 team win, have their work cut out. .Defenders Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel are suspended because of bookings, limiting coach Lionel Scaloni’s options at the back. Nicolas Tagliafico could come on to replace the former but it will be a less attacking formation, with wingback Acuna having added more spark to the team. .A question mark also hangs over veteran Angel Di Maria and his fitness, with the 34-year-old having primarily been used as a substitute in the tournament despite recovering from injury. .Messi, at 35, is playing likely his last World Cup and is also carrying the weight of the nation on his shoulders. Comparisons of Messi with Maradona for the title of the greatest Argentinian player of all time cannot be complete without a world title, which the late Maradona won almost single-handedly 36 years ago. .Pressure swirling around the forthcoming encounter is intense, particularly about the prospect of a penalty showdown. .Argentina almost did not make the semifinals after the Dutch came from 2-0 down to score twice late in the game and force extra time and penalties in a bad-tempered encounter. A repeat of a penalty shootout, this time against mentally tough Croatia, must be a terrifying prospect for the Argentinians even though their keeper Emiliano Martinez rose to the occasion against the Netherlands, saving two spot kicks. .Croatia came through two penalty shootouts and extra time to reach the 2018 final before losing to France, and have gone to penalties in both their knockout stage matches in Qatar — against Japan and Brazil — to boast a perfect record and to be dubbed the “World Cup’s penalty shootout king” by the Wall Street Journal. .Based on those statistics, another shootout against Argentina would most likely carry them into the final.",119
120,Published On 11 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: 10 big moments so far,"From injury time to Morocco’s brilliance to Ronaldo’s benching, here are the 10 talking points from the tournament.",".The World Cup in Qatar is now at the semifinal stage: Either Argentina, France, Croatia or Morocco will win football’s biggest prize at Lusail Stadium next Sunday. .But already, the 2022 World Cup has offered up plenty of big moments that are unlikely to be forgotten. .In their first game of the tournament against England, Iran’s players took the bold step of not singing their national anthem before kickoff. It was a gesture to show their support for the nationwide protests taking place in their country in the wake of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death in the custody of the morality police. .Their silence spoke volumes and added pressure on the Iranian government, which suspended the morality police last week. .Argentina’s World Cup campaign has been so fraught with drama that it’s easy to forget that it began with them losing to Saudi Arabia 2-1 in their opening game. .The second-lowest-ranked team in the tournament mounted an incredible comeback after going a goal down to score twice in the space of five minutes in the second half. The result sent tremors across the footballing world. The fact that Saudi Arabia lost their following two group games didn’t matter. It wasn’t just a win for the national team. It was a win for the nation. .In their opening group games, the captains of England, Wales, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Denmark had decided to wear OneLove armbands, a symbolic gesture for anti-discrimination. But FIFA banned the armband and threatened sanctions for any team whose captain wore it on the pitch. .In protest of having their freedom of expression curtailed, the entire German national team posed for their pre-match photo with their hands covering their mouths. .Emiliano Martinez’s heroics in the penalty shootout against the Netherlands have taken Argentina within a victory of the final. Following their defeat to Saudi Arabia in the opening game, Martinez had said every game from then is akin to a final. The first of those came against Mexico, where a defeat would have sent Argentina back home. .This pressure cooker of a game had its lid blown off in the second half by Lionel Messi’s left boot. It was an astonishing finish from outside the box into the bottom corner. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s where their World Cup truly began. . .Sure, this wasn’t a moment – it was 45 minutes. But it was a flash of brilliance that would eventually pass too soon. Brazil were 4-0 up at halftime in their round of 16 game. It wasn’t just the South Korean backline, but the wider footballing world they had dancing to their samba beat. It was a performance that Brazil have been historically renowned for: quick attacking play, sharp movement and dollops of flair. .Their campaign may have ultimately ended in tears but for those minutes, Brazil Braziled and it was beautiful to watch. .Wout Weghorst’s goal in the 11th minute of injury time to bring the Netherlands back from the brink of defeat against Argentina in the quarterfinal will go down as one of the great World Cup moments of all time. The craft and awareness of the quickly taken free kick took the Argentine defence and millions across the world by surprise. The timing and weight of the goal aside, the fact that Weghorst was a Burnley forward whose style of play had made him a figure of scorn in the footballing public only heightened the incredulity of the moment. .Weghorst had scored earlier too, and the goal off a free kick was his second of the game. That he still couldn’t save the Netherlands — who lost in a penalty shootout — makes Weghorst’s genius even more of an underdog tale for the ages. .They ground out a penalty shootout win over Japan in the round of 16 and then held their nerve against the much-fancied Brazil to book a spot in the final four on Friday, building on a stunning legacy. .Consider this statistic: In the six World Cups in which Croatia have competed, they’ve reached the semifinals three times. Reaching the final in 2018 was considered the pinnacle for this team. Their dull, lumbering performances in the first few games this time around didn’t alleviate concerns around their age and speed. But what they lack in agility, they make up for in ability and experience. .Interestingly, they have yet to win a knockout game in 90 minutes since 2018. Croatia have mastered the art of the smash and grab. Messi and the Argentina team, who face them next, will not make the mistake of underestimating them. .When they lifted coach Walid Regragui up high to celebrate their quarterfinal win over Portugal, it epitomised Morocco’s unprecedented accomplishments. .At every World Cup there’s one team that punches above its weight, defeating odds and opposition alike. It was Ghana in 2010, Costa Rica in 2014 and Croatia in 2018. This time, the mantle has been taken up by Morocco, who have created history by becoming the first African nation to reach the semifinals. .The destination is as incredible as their journey to get there. They topped a group that featured Croatia and Belgium, knocked out Spain on penalties in the round of 16 and then Portugal in the quarterfinals. Despite the strength of the opposition they’ve come up against, the Atlas Lions have conceded just once in the tournament. . .In the process, the Moroccan side have inspired not just their nation, but the Arab world, Africa and the larger Global South, emerging as the neutral’s favourite. Their fans have been the most colourful and prominent throughout the World Cup. But their secret sauce? Families of players, and especially their mothers, who have accompanied the team, kissed them and wished them luck and even danced with them on the pitch. .You had to read the team sheet a couple of times over to be sure that you hadn’t skipped over his name. Cristiano Ronaldo being dropped for Portugal’s round of 16 game against Switzerland felt seismic. Coach Fernando Santos had spoken about his displeasure with Ronaldo’s reaction to being subbed off against South Korea in his press conference the previous day and had refused to confirm if he’d be given the armband. .While Ronaldo not being captain felt unlikely, him being dropped altogether wasn’t even considered a possibility. Portugal looked young, wild and free in his absence and won 6-1. The fact that his replacement, Gonçalo Ramos, scored a hat trick only furthered the narrative. .There was a staggering 563 minutes of injury time played in the group stages of this World Cup. In the England-Iran group game, 27 minutes were added on to the regular 90. All of that is the outcome of a deliberate decision by FIFA to add on time for all stoppages more strictly than ever before. .  .",120
121,Published On 11 Dec 2022,Morocco’s ‘Bono’ linked to big clubs after World Cup heroics,"The Moroccan goalkeeper has already created history, helping his nation reach the World Cup semifinals.",".Morocco’s win over Portugal to become the first African side to reach the World Cup semifinals produced some iconic images: Youssef En-Nesyri’s leap for the goal, Sofiane Boufal dancing with his mother on the touchline, manager Walid Regragui being hoisted by his players, the unbridled joy among Moroccan fans in the stands. .Yet a crucial moment that enabled these scenes of euphoria came in the 84th minute, with Portugal pressing hard for an equaliser. .Joao Felix was teed up by Cristiano Ronaldo and the curling left-footed strike he unleashed seemed destined for the top corner of Morocco’s goal. But Yassine Bounou had other ideas. The goalkeeper tipped the ball behind for a corner, leaving Felix with an expression of disbelief. It was a moment that passed by in a split second but one that Moroccan football will relive for decades. .It is among a string of such epic saves by Bounou at the World Cup in Qatar that helped his side create history while also propelling him into the global limelight. .Rumours are swirling of top European clubs, from Real Madrid to Manchester United, taking interest in the Moroccan goalkeeper, who is also known as Bono – the name he wears on his jersey. .Albeit protected by an able defence, Bounou has kept three clean sheets so far in the World Cup, the joint-best in the tournament. It is a feat no African goalkeeper has ever achieved before. .In four games between the posts, Bounou has conceded just one goal. His goals conceded per 90 minutes is 0.23, the lowest so far in this World Cup. He did not play in Morocco’s first big upset of the tournament, against Belgium. .But he starred in his side’s win over Spain in the round of 16, keeping out all three penalties in the shootout. .While Bounou is one of the breakout successes of the World Cup, La Liga fans are well acquainted with his skills. The Sevilla keeper conceded five fewer goals last season than Real Madrid’s Thibaut Courtois, arguably the number one goalkeeper in the world. The Moroccan’s 13 clean sheets saw him crowned the best goalkeeper of the year in La Liga. .Born in Montreal to Moroccan parents, Bounou was eligible to play for Canada and was even contacted by the Canadian manager in 2013. But he ultimately opted to play for Morocco. .“I am originally from Morocco and I grew up there. I always dreamed of playing for the Atlas Lions,” he said in an interview to the Spanish television show Balón Parado before the World Cup. .While Moroccan fans must be thanking their stars for Bounou, Sevilla supporters may soon have to part ways with him. He has begun to receive courting glances from Europe’s elite clubs, and the Andalusian side – where he is currently in his fourth year – will have a task on their hands to keep hold of him. .For teams that have still not found what they are looking for between the posts, “Bono” might be the answer.",121
122,Published On 11 Dec 2022,‘Need time’: Southgate on his England future after World Cup loss,,".England coach Gareth Southgate cut a disconsolate figure after his side lost to France in the World Cup quarter-final on Saturday but said he would not make any decision about his future in the heat of the moment. .With England skipper Harry Kane missing a late penalty that would have brought Southgate’s side level with the 2018 champions at Al Bayt Stadium, France held on for a 2-1 victory to set up a semi-final showdown with Morocco. .“Whenever I finish these tournaments, you need time to make the correct decision. Emotionally, you’re going through many different feelings,” Southgate told reporters. “The energy that it takes in these tournaments is enormous. I want to take the right decision, whatever that is, for the team.” .There had been similar questions around Southgate’s future in the aftermath of England’s loss in the Euro 2020 final last year but, in November, he signed a contract extension until December 2024. If he honours the deal, it would see him take charge of England for Euro 2024, his fourth major tournament as England boss. .Under Southgate, who took charge in 2016, England have turned nearly two decades of chronic underperformance on its head. The Three Lions reached the World Cup semi-final in 2018, the Euro 2020 final and the quarterfinal of the 2022 World Cup under his stewardship. .And while the losses last year and now in Qatar are bound to raise questions over England’s ability to go all the way at marquee football events, the team has shown rare success in high-pressure games under their current coach. Between 1968 and 2016, England won just six knockout games at major tournaments. They’ve won as many under Southgate. .Southgate is also credited by many for his role in transforming the image of the England men’s national team. Public support for the team hasn’t been this high in decades and Southgate has put together a young squad brimming with talent who are inherently likeable. It is not a quantifiable metric but in a nation as passionate about its football as England, it is one that can be harder to accomplish than on-field results. .On Saturday, England by many measures played better as they went toe-to-toe against the defending champions. .“They know how close they’ve come, they know they pushed a top nation all the way, they had more possession, more attempts on goal, I’m very proud of how they’ve been – not only tonight but whole tournament,” Southgate said. .He refused to dwell on Kane’s missed penalty in the 84th minute. .“We’ve had consistent performances over three tournaments. Tonight is the best we’ve played against a major nation since I’ve been in charge, but we have fallen short. In the end, the scoreline is what matters.” .Yet the scoreline can be complicated: Southgate’s shows that England are out of the World Cup – and that he is the most successful coach they’ve had in decades.",122

But Croatia, who tallied an equaliser in the dying minutes of added time, ultimately snuck away with a victory on penalties, stunning Brazil. .Neymar broke down in tears in midfield after his teammate Marquinhos’ shot rang off the post, giving Croatia the win. .He had been slated to take the fifth penalty shot that never was. .In a remarkable and touching post-match moment, Brazilian defender Dani Alves quickly came to his aid, embracing a weeping Neymar as he absorbed his fate. .“He should have taken the fifth and decisive penalty,” Brazilian coach Tite told reporters after the game. “The player with the most quality and mental skills is the one to be in charge in the moment when the pressure is high.” .Pele, 82, who was hospitalised earlier this month for a respiratory infection amid a cancer diagnosis, also congratulated Neymar for tying his record in an Instagram post of his own. .“I saw you grow up, I cheered for you every day and finally I can congratulate you on equalling my number of goals with the Brazilian National Team,” wrote Pele. “We both know that it’s much more than a number. Our greatest duty as athletes is to inspire.” .He again called Neymar a national “inspiration”. .“Unfortunately, the day is not the happiest for us, but you will always be the source of inspiration that many aspire to become,” the football great added. “I’ve learned as time goes by the more our legacy grows. My record was set almost 50 years ago, and no one has come close to it until now. [You] got there boy.” .Emotions were running high for Brazilian fans in Doha and around the world after Brazil’s unexpected departure from the tournament. .“The sadness is too much,” Brazil supporter Paolo Souza told Al Jazeera after Friday’s match at Education City Stadium. “We had the best team in the world.” .Indeed, Brazil had been ranked number one by FIFA heading into the 2022 World Cup. And for many fans of the South American team – who will now have to wait another four years for a shot at redemption – the loss struck a nerve. .“We were very confident that we could win it this year but it was not meant to be,” Souza said. .“The defeat is so painful.”",123

He was almost completely alone. .Ronaldo has yet to comment on his future. . .If Qatar is indeed the end, it will be a bittersweet conclusion to a legendary career for the Portuguese player. .Ronaldo’s biggest moment at the tournament – when he became the only male player in history to score a goal in five separate World Cups – will surely be remembered for generations. .Ronaldo holds the world record as the all-time overall leading scorer in international play with 118 international goals in 196 matches. He is also a five-time Ballon d’Or winner, the recipient of four European Golden Shoes and has seven league titles under his belt. .In October, he scored the 700th goal of his club career for Manchester United. .The 2022 World Cup, though, was surely a rollercoaster of ups and downs. .Notably, Ronaldo was benched in Portugal’s first knockout round 6-1 demolition of Switzerland – the first time since 2008 – after he angrily reacted to being substituted against South Korea in the side’s final group match. Reports later swirled that he had threatened to walk out on the Portuguese squad amid their World Cup run. Portugal denied those reports. .On Saturday, Ronaldo again was relegated to the bench by head coach Fernando Santos, who gave his replacement, Gonçalo Ramos, the nod after he scored a hat-trick in the match against Switzerland. .“No regrets,” Santos said of his decision not to start his captain for the second consecutive match. .“Cristiano is a great player, he came in when we thought it was necessary. We have no regret.” .Ronaldo was not subbed onto the pitch until the 51st minute, and as he rushed onto the field, he swapped the captain’s armband with veteran defender Pepe before turning his attention to his remaining teammates, whom he desperately urged to press on. .His late-game cameo was met with a resounding chorus of jeers at Al Thumama Stadium, where Portugal fans were vastly outnumbered by Morocco supporters. As the final whistle neared, Ronaldo threw his arms up to the Portugal fans, in a last-ditch attempt to rouse the crowd. .He nearly generated a scoring chance in the 82nd minute, setting up teammate João Félix, whose shot was denied by Morocco’s goalkeeper. In the end, Ronaldo and the team were unable to repair the damage done by Morocco’s Youssef En Nesyri, whose game-winning header in the 42nd minute was enough to carry the Atlas Lions to the World Cup semi-finals. .As a tearful Ronaldo broke for the locker rooms, his teammates, still paralysed by the loss, lingered on the field to interact and thank the Portugal supporters. .Former Spain international Javier Martinez said he did not believe Ronaldo would continue with the national team, adding he could understand the Portuguese superstar’s reaction. .“This was maybe the last chance he got to win a World Cup,” Martinez told Al Jazeera. “Such a player like him, he deserved a World Cup and he’s very disappointed.” .Portugal, who edged Ghana and shut out Uruguay, before being upset 2-1 by South Korea in the group stages, have not advanced beyond the last 16 since their fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.  Seleção das Quinas finished third in 1966. The team has never won a World Cup. .Ronaldo, who exits Qatar having never scored a knockout round goal, will now transition back to an uncertain club future. .Days into the tournament, Ronaldo was dropped by Manchester United with “immediate effect” after he conducted an explosive interview on the eve of the World Cup, in which he sharply criticised manager Erik ten Hag. .Ronaldo has weathered his fair share of on- and off-the-field controversies over the past two decades, but he may now be entering the toughest stage of his career.",124

England fans were left particularly aggrieved after calls for two suspected fouls against Bukayo Saka were dismissed in the seconds before the defending world champions opened the scoring. .It was a largely equally matched first half, but England began the second with renewed vigour. Saka was again brought down shortly after kickoff, but this time it was inside the French box, and the referee pointed to the spot. .Captain Harry Kane blasted the penalty kick into the net past his Tottenham Hotspurs’s teammate Hugo Lloris to equalise in the 54th minute in front of a 68,895-strong crowd. It was a goal which left him equal with Wayne Rooney as the joint-highest scorer for the Three Lions. .There was a chance for Gareth Southgate’s men to go ahead in the 70th minute, but Harry Maguire missed the target, putting the ball into the side of the net. .In the 76th, Olivier Giroud found a huge gap in the English defence and levelled a massive left-foot volley. It was caught safely by Pickford, but England were not off the hook for long. .Another minute, another cross, another chance for Giroud, and France’s leading goalscorer headed home to give France the lead, sending Les Bleus fans inside the stadium into ecstasy. .England had a golden chance to equalise in the 84th minute after Theo Hernandez barged into Mason Mount inside the box, but Kane this time skied his penalty attempt into orbit. .In the end, the French press was too strong for the Three Lions to stomach, and France go on to play Morocco in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday at Al Bayt Stadium. .“It’s extraordinary. We worked really hard defensively when we were ahead. It reminds me of Belgium in 2018,” said Giroud, referring to France’s 1-0 win in the semi-finals four years ago in Russia. .“Unfortunately we conceded the penalty. But we were able to be dangerous on a few occasions at the end of the match.You always have to believe and (Antoine) Griezmann gave me a great ball (for the goal),” added Giroud. .“I’m so proud. We pulled out a big performance tonight,” he continued. “We knew the potential of this young English generation. They’ve got it all. We had to use our mental strength to get over the line.” .“It’s difficult to find the right words,” Jordan Henderson told ITV Sport after the game. .“We gave everything in the game, with the character and the mentality to keep going and find the equaliser. I can’t say any more, really — we gave it everything.” .England manager Gareth Southgate said he did not think his side could have done any more and had given France a great game. .“I think it was just the key moments, you’re playing in a high level game where there aren’t going to be many chances created and within most of the big moments we were in the right place,” he said, while also backing Kane. .“For me, we win and lose as a team and we’ve let a couple of goals in and missed a few chances,” Southgate said. “Harry has been incredible for us, so reliable in those sorts of situations. We wouldn’t be here, but for the number of goals he scored for us,” he added. .At the stadium, France fans were happy their team booked a place in the semi-final. .“It was a close game. They did not want to play. Kylian Mbappe was marked everywhere he went,” Max Balazun told Al Jazeera. .“It’s going to be a very hard game against Morocco. They eliminated Spain and Portugal,” he said. .Hamza Mohamed contributed reporting from Al Bayt Stadium.",126

Supporters of the Scottish side Motherwell – apparently inspired by a scene from the film 300 – have also been performing a similar clap for many years. .Since Iceland’s use of the clap at the 2016 European Championships, its popularity has spread worldwide and can now be heard at Kerala Blasters games in India and among supporters of Perspolis Football Club in Iran. .There can be parallels drawn to Iceland’s unexpected success at the Euro 2016, where they reached the quarter-finals beating England along the way. .Morocco have made it to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in their history, beating second-ranked Belgium and knocking out Spain in the process. .The adapted clap is an apt reflection of how massive and loud Morocco’s support has been throughout the tournament. . .“I feel so enthusiastic and very proud of my country. I love Morocco, and when I hear all of us singing and clapping together, I want to support the team even more, no matter how bad they are playing,” said Marwa Mifta, a 38-year-old doctor from Rabat, at the match against Portugal. .Reda el-Harrachi, 30, said when she hears the thunderclap inside the stadium, she gets “goosebumps everywhere”. .Alasdair Howorth, a journalist specialising in African football, believes that Moroccan fans have made this World Cup a “home tournament” for their team. .“It can’t be underestimated how big Moroccan and Tunisian fans have been at this World Cup,” Howorth said, adding that the media placed a lot of scrutiny on Qatar and this World Cup, but what “hasn’t been talked about enough is how important it is having a World Cup in the Arab world“. .The support they have received in Qatar, the ease of travel to and around the country, and the sizable diasporas have resulted in what Howorth describes as a “real connection” between the fans and this World Cup. .“Morocco has one of the best fan cultures in the world in terms of passion,” he says. “I think it is brilliant that the world has finally seen it because it has been there for a very long time.”",134

But a team is made up of 11 players, not one,” the 44-year-old engineer told Al Jazeera. “The coach and his staff know what’s best for the whole team. And if starting Ronaldo works, then sure, otherwise, no problem. .Maria Rodrigo, 34, believes there has been too much “negativity” about Ronaldo in the media and he is still the team’s “best player”. .“He might not be having the best form, but he is still amazing and has given Portugal so much, the media just likes to create so much negativity,” Rodrigo, who is from Lisbon but lives in London, said. “It would be a shame if he doesn’t start. No one wants to win more than him.” .Following the South Korea game, Portugal manager Fernando Santos made his feelings clear about his star striker’s reaction during the pre-match news conference on Monday. .“I didn’t like it, not at all. I really did not like it,” Santos told reporters. “But from that moment onwards, everything is finished, full stop, regarding that issue,” Santos said. “Now, we have to think about tomorrow’s match, and everyone is focused on tomorrow’s match.” .Ronaldo came on for the game against Switzerland on December 6 in the 72nd minute and was unfortunate not to score in the 6-1 rout of the Swiss side.",136

We had the best team in the world,” Brazil supporter Paolo Souza told Al Jazeera after the match at Education City Stadium. .“We were very confident that we could win it this year but it was not meant to be. The defeat is so painful,” said the 37-year-old Brazilian. .The five-time World Cup champions were on course to defeat the Balkan nation after Neymar scored in the first half of extra time, the game’s first goal. .But, Croatia – losing finalists at the 2018 World Cup – scored an equaliser in the closing minutes of extra time, eventually emerging victorious on penalties. .Brazilian supporters, who made up the vast majority of fans at the stadium, arrived to the game with warmth, fervour and infectious music. But after the nail-biting game ended., there was no samba, no Surdao drum solos or tambourine performances but just groups of Canarinho fans heading for the exists as sadness lingered in the air. .Brasilia resident Roger Oliviera said that had the Brazil team progressed, he and his partner would have done everything to try to stay for the semi-final. .“I am heartbroken,” 49-year-old Oliveira said, shaking his head. “This year was supposed to be our trophy. I could just feel it. I thought Neymar had won it for us but that’s football. We love our team but I’m glad I have four years to recover from this.” .The South American nation has not beaten a European team in the knockout stages of the World Cup since 2002, which was the last time they won the World Cup. .Sao Paolo resident Carolina Disa, who was in tears after the match, said her nine-year-old daughter called on the phone crying from Brazil after the defeat. .“We never thought we would lose. I am so sad,” Disa, a mother of three, said, adding that football is “very important” for Brazilians and for some, it is the only thing they “look forward” to in their lives. .“Back home we have a lot of poor people. The only happiness they have is Brazilian football. We are very proud of our national teams,” she added. .Disa’s husband, Diego, said the couple would stay in Qatar until the end of the tournament on December 19. They have tickets to watch the semi-final and final. .“Right now we are all cheering for every team but Argentina,” he said. “For us, Portugal is Brazil; Morocco is Brazil.”",138
139,Published On 10 Dec 2022,US football writer Wahl dies covering World Cup quarter-final,Grant Wahl was at the Netherlands vs Argentina match when he collapsed.,".United States football is in mourning following the death of American football writer Grant Wahl who died while in Qatar covering the World Cup. .Wahl, 49, collapsed as he watched the Argentina vs Netherlands quarter-final from the press area of Lusail Stadium on Friday night, prompting fellow journalists to call for medical attention, according to an Associated Press report. .Wahl, who was taken out of the media section on a stretcher, was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead. .Reporters who witnessed the incident said medics arrived on-scene quickly. .Wahl’s agent, Tim Scanlan, told Reuters news agency that the journalist had “appeared to suffer some kind of acute distress in the start of extra time” in the match. .“Everyone’s emotional and it’s really traumatic,” Scanlan said. “He was a true advocate for both the men’s and women’s games and really just cared deeply about the sport. He was empathetic and just truly a brilliant writer.” .Wahl, who was covering his eighth World Cup, had celebrated his 49th birthday on Wednesday. .“He received immediate emergency medical treatment on site, which continued as he was transferred by ambulance to Hamad General Hospital,” the World Cup organising committee said in a statement, which did not list a cause of death. .“We are in touch with the US Embassy and relevant local authorities to ensure the process of repatriating the body is in accordance with the family’s wishes.” . .On Monday, Wahl wrote on social media about his ailing health, which required him to visit a medical centre in Qatar. He had mused that his gruelling work schedule surrounding World Cup coverage had adversely affected his wellbeing. .“My body finally broke down on me. Three weeks of little sleep, high stress and lots of work can do that to you,” Wahl wrote on Substack. .“What had been a cold over the last 10 days turned into something more severe on the night of the USA-Netherlands game, and I could feel my upper chest take on a new level of pressure and discomfort.” .Wahl added that he had tested negative for COVID-19, for which he had regularly been screened for since arriving in Doha last month. .“I went into the medical clinic at the main media center today, and they said I probably have bronchitis,” he added. “They gave me a course of antibiotics and some heavy-duty cough syrup, and I’m already feeling a bit better just a few hours later. But still: No bueno.” .The US Soccer Federation said on Friday that it was “heartbroken” by Wahl’s death. .“We could always count on Grant to deliver insightful and entertaining stories about our game, and its major protagonists,” the federation said in a statement. . .Wahl had worn a rainbow T-shirt in support of LGBTQ rights to the USA World Cup opener against Wales on November 21 and wrote that security had refused him entry and told him to remove the shirt. .Wahl said that FIFA later apologised to him for the incident, which he said involved him being stopped for 25 minutes before he was allowed to enter the stadium.",139

142,Published On 10 Dec 2022,"Carrying hopes of Africa, Morocco aim for World Cup semi-finals",The Atlas Lions are now looking to become the first side from the continent to make it through to the semi-finals.,".As Morocco’s history-making football team prepares to take on 2016 European champions Portugal in the World Cup quarter-final, expectations are high. .There were jubilant scenes in Qatar, Morocco, across the Arab world, in Europe and in Africa after Morocco beat fancied Spain on penalties to reach the quarter-finals. .Morocco are now bearing the hopes of a continent and battling the weight of history: No African side has ever made it beyond this stage of a World Cup. .“At some point in Africa, we have to be ambitious and think why not win the World Cup, even if it’s going to be hard,” Morocco’s Walid Regragui said in the aftermath of the triumph over Spain. .Having reached their first quarter-final, the 1976 African champions seem poised to eclipse the achievements of Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002, and Ghana in 2010. .Those losses inflicted by England, Turkey, and Uruguay respectively, all triggered scenes of heartbreak for Africans. .Morocco, who reached the round of 16 at the 1986 World Cup, are the only team from outside Europe or South America to make it to this stage in Qatar. .Well-organised, Morocco are in form – they are yet to lose at this World Cup and have conceded only one goal in their past seven games. .They have extended their unbeaten run in the World Cup to five games and kept a clean sheet in six out of their last seven in all competitions. .“How they’ve built up to this stage has been the most impressive thing,” Michael Oti Adjei of Ghana’s Media General Group, told Al Jazeera. “They sacked the coach before the tournament and brought in somebody who was not afraid to make decisions and the tactical discipline. .“Most of the time, we’ve spoken about African heads dropping in the most important moment. Of course, Morocco has to show that that will not be the case in the semi-final against Portugal. Regragui has done an amazing job so far.” .Not since Ghana’s famous run in South Africa in 2010 has the continent united and rallied behind an African nation on the global stage. .“Morocco has genuinely captured the hearts and imagination of Africa with their bravery and nous,” Solace Chukwu, senior sports editor at Pulse Sports, told Al Jazeera. .“This comes through even on social media – there is a real sense of people identifying with Morocco, of them flying not just a North African or Arabic flag, but an African one.” .The sentiment is echoed by Gabriel Zakuani, former captain of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s team. .“As an African, watching another country from the continent go far in the tournament makes me very proud, “ he said. .“They look very solid and also look very dangerous going forward. Ziyech has taken them to a different level. I think this run has given more respect to African football and should they beat Portugal, which is quite possible; it will take the continent’s game to a different level.” .There is the sense that a semi-final place is long overdue for Africa and while Portugal pose a major challenge, they are perhaps the most surmountable of the remaining teams in the competition. .Still, the Seleção das Quinas are no pushovers. The decision of coach Fernando Santos to leave Cristiano Ronaldo out of the starting lineup for the round of 16 meeting with Switzerland was justified when replacement Goncalo Ramos struck thrice. .It is a marker of Portugal’s quality and strength in depth. And in the likes of Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes, they boast some of the World Cup’s leading creative players. .It is a stark contrast with Morocco, who are worried about the fitness of several key individuals ahead of their meeting. So far in the competition, Regragui has been reluctant to shuffle the pack too much, confident in his first XI and seemingly in little else besides. .On paper, the odds are stacked against the Atlas Lions. .Nevertheless, the fire of an African dream burns bright. “I grew up watching a handful of teams dominate football so it’s refreshing to see what Morocco is doing,” Tunisian journalist Souhail Khmira said. “It’s nice to see the tables turning. There’s a collective hope that Morocco will break the African record at the World Cup.” .With their heroic upsets so far uniting a continent in support of them, a Morocco win over Portugal would be wildly celebrated once again across the North African country and in the Moroccan diasporas in cities across Europe. But just as importantly, it would deepen the respect for the team globally, as the outsiders who made their mark.",142
143,Published On 10 Dec 2022,France vs England match preview: World Cup 2022 quarter-final,Reigning world champions France take on an unbeaten England in a heavyweight quarter-final matchup.,".Who: England vs France .Where: Al Bayt Stadium .When: December 10, 10pm (19:00 GMT) .Expectations will weigh heavy on the current world champions France as they head into this high-profile quarter-final matchup against an unbeaten England side that has scored 12 goals in four games and conceded only two. .However, if any team can break this impressive record, it should be France, who brushed aside a spirited Poland in the last 16 after a rampant Kylian Mbappe produced another vintage World Cup performance. .England will have to come up with a plan to contain the in-form and motivated 23-year-old who whipped in a brace to bring his 2022 World Cup tally to five goals and admitted after the match that winning the tournament had become an “obsession”. .Olivier Giroud, Ousmane Dembélé and Antoine Griezmann also enjoyed excellent performances, linking up well and outplaying Poland for large parts of the game. Giroud’s goal against the Poles made him France’s all-time top scorer, with 52 goals. But Griezmann with 42 and Mbappe with 33 also figure among France’s top seven goal-scorers ever — an indication of the once-in-a-generation pedigree that England will face. .But England will bring their own exciting balance of experience and young talent to the pitch. Manchester City’s Phil Foden, Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka and Borussia Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham have all produced fine performances so far this tournament. Raheem Sterling, who scored in England’s 6-2 win over Iran, has also returned to Qatar after leaving the squad last weekend following a break-in at his home. .Apart from a lacklustre goalless draw against the USA, England have looked in cruise control for most of their World Cup campaign. After a ropey opening third, England brushed aside Senegal 3-0 in the round of 16 and will head into the quarter-final high on confidence. .England manager Gareth Southgate has warned against complacency ahead of the match, saying, “In terms of France, it’s the biggest test we could face.” .France have conceded in all four matches so far, including a 1-0 loss to Tunisia in their final group-stage game. True, France had already qualified for the round of 16 and fielded a weakened team. Still, the Eagles of Carthage exposed a vulnerability in France’s defence that England’s forwards will look to exploit. .There’s little to choose between the sides in terms of FIFA ranking — France are currently placed fourth with England in fifth. England won both their previous two World Cup meetings in 1966 and 1982. .More recently, coaches Gareth Southgate and Didier Deschamps faced each other in an international friendly in 2017. It was a close affair, with Harry Kane grabbing a brace for England before Mbappe and Dembélé produced a fine second-half performance that would see France as eventual 3-2 winners. .Each of those players is expected to play a key role for their sides on Saturday, in what promises to be a mouthwatering contest. Both sides made it to the semi-finals in 2018. This time, only one will.",143

But they’ll be up against a Portugal side that fired six goals past Switzerland on Tuesday – without needing to start with Cristiano Ronaldo. .Morocco, buoyed by their penalty heroics against Spain in the last 16, are now in uncharted territory: They have never made it to the quarter-finals before. But they have only conceded one goal in four World Cup games. Morocco also boast arguably the most vocal and dedicated set of supporters at this tournament. .If Morocco win, they will be the first African team to reach a World Cup semi-final. The winner of their game against Portugal will take on either England or France in the final four. .Portugal’s coach, Fernando Santos, chose to start the Switzerland game with star forward Ronaldo on the bench. The decision appeared to unshackle the attacking creativity in the team as Ronaldo’s replacement Goncalo Ramos bagged himself a hat-trick. Ramos has scored 14 goals in 21 games for Benfica this season and lived up to his nickname O Feiticeiro – the wizard – against the Swiss. He will be a player that Morocco will need to keep an eye on. .Morocco have shown incredible composure so far in this tournament and are unlikely to be intimidated by the occasion. Nothing embodies their calm and collected spirit more than Morocco and Paris Saint-Germain’s defensive stalwart, Achraf Hakimi, who scored their winning penalty against Spain with the gentlest of panenkas. .Yassine “Bono” Bounou, Morocco’s mild-mannered goalkeeper, was the match’s hero as Spain failed to score a single penalty in the shootout. He will need to continue this form in the face of a red-hot Portugal attack. .To be clear, Morocco are not just a defensive side; they also boast a considerable creative flair, including Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal, the former Southampton winger who bamboozled Spain’s Marcos Llorente several times with his trickery. .Portugal also boast an abundance of creative talent, with the likes of Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes driving forward and Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva in midfield. .Danilo Pereira, the Paris Saint-Germain centre back, is still a doubt for the game after fracturing several ribs in training. However, Pepe, the 39-year-old veteran, has done a fine job as a replacement and even grabbed a goal in Portugal’s 6-1 rout of Switzerland. .The two teams have faced each other twice at the World Cup. At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Morocco beat Portugal 3-1 in the group stages. Ronaldo scored the only goal of the game at the 2018 World Cup in Russia as Portugal picked up a vital three points to progress to the round of 16. .The 37-year-old, beset by controversies in recent weeks, will want to cement his legacy by extending Portugal’s run at this World Cup, likely to be his last. But history beckons for Morocco, too. It’s the stuff dreams and heartbreak are made of.",144

Maybe I’m not thinking straight. To say that this is the end would be rushing myself, but I don’t guarantee anything either. Let’s see what happens going forward,” the ESPN sports network reported. .Neymar had hinted in November that Qatar could be his final World Cup. .“I can’t guarantee that I’ll play another [World] Cup,” he told Brazilian network Globo. “I honestly don’t know. I’ll play like it’s the last. Maybe I’ll play another one, maybe not. It depends. There’s going to be a coaching change and I don’t know if that coach will like me.” .Brazil’s crushing loss capped a bittersweet day for Neymar, the Paris Saint-Germain forward whose first-half goal, which put Brazil on top momentarily, tied him with Pele as his country’s all-time leading scorer. It was his 77th goal in 124 international matches. .“I want to take this time to think about it, think about what I want for myself,” he said. .“I will not close the door to playing with Brazil, nor do I say 100 percent that I’ll come back.” .The 30-year-old found the back of the net twice at the World Cup, his first goal coming in the last 16 in Brazil’s 4-1 steamrolling of South Korea after he sat out two group stage games due to an ankle injury he sustained in the team’s opening match against Serbia. .Neymar was slated to take Brazil’s fifth and decisive penalty kick but Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livaković denied him the opportunity after shutting down Rodrygo then Marquinhos’s shot hit the post. .“He should have taken the fifth and decisive penalty,” Brazilian coach Tite told reporters. “The player with the most quality and mental skills is the one to be in charge in the moment when the pressure is high.” .Tite, who has led the Brazilian team for the past six years, announced his resignation as head coach following the shattering loss to Croatia. .“The cycle has ended, and I keep to my word,” Tite, 61, said following Friday’s game. .“There are other great professionals that can replace me. When their [Croatia’s] goalkeeper [Dominik Livaković] is the best player on the field, the game is talking to you. We had to be more effective in making goals. But did Brazil show their best? Overall, yes.” . .Neymar, who has not yet hoisted a World Cup, despite a storied career, was a crucial component of Brazil’s quarter-final run in Russia four years ago when the team was beaten by Belgium. He has won two LaLiga titles, four Ligue 1 titles, a Champions League trophy and a Copa Libertadores. .Veteran Brazil defender Dani Alves, who consoled Neymar on the field following the Croatia match, also announced he will be retiring from international play but said he would continue competing in club leagues. .In one of the more touching post-match moments, the son of Croatian forward Ivan Perisić rushed to comfort a tearful Neymar as he and Alves embraced each other at midfield. .",145

You are born with it,” Agarwal told Al Jazeera. .Agarwal is just one of the many non-Argentinian fans of Argentina who have embraced the Albicelestes as their team of choice and travelled to Qatar to show their support for the South Americans. .Agarwal said, growing up in India, he became an Argentina fan because of the legendary Diego Maradona, and he sees echoes of Maradona in the current team’s star player and captain Lionel Messi. .“Every time I see Messi he reminds me of Maradona. Anyone who loves football loves Messi,” he said, his voice husky after much cheering during Argentina’s hard-fought penalty win over the Oranje of the Netherlands. .“Who else could do that other than Messi?” Agarwal said referring to the pass that led to the first Argentina goal against the Dutch on Friday. .“I will travel anywhere to witness such magic.” . .The mood inside the 88,000-capacity Lusail Stadium was electric on Friday night thanks to the Albicelestes fans. Everywhere you looked, there were banners adorned with images of Messi and Maradona. .The Dutch fans were not only outnumbered, they were also out-cheered by Argentina’s supporters, who had travelled from across the world to see Messi lead his team to victory. .Messi, a seven-time Ballon d’or winner, said this would be his last World Cup. The little magician, as he is known, has been in top form on the pitch during this tournament and now has three goals to his name. .As the Dutch sat deep in defence in their match on Friday night, it was Messi’s run and exquisite pass that unlocked and outdid their defenders. .Each time Messi got the ball near the Oranje goal, it felt as if the entire stadium was on its feet cheering wildly and expecting to witness Messi’s magic. .Argentina are favourites to lift the World Cup trophy and their fans know it. They have come in huge numbers, not just expecting to win but to be entertained too. .But the team suffered a huge shock when they were beaten in their opening game by Saudi Arabia and there were worries Messi might head home early. But it was Messi’s magic that unlocked Mexico in their second game where Argentina won 2-0 in what was a very nervy match. .Ali Khajah, an electrical engineer from Kuwait, could not believe he finally had a chance to watch Argentina and Messi. .“This is my second Argentina game I’m watching in this World Cup. It’s an honour to see him and Argentina in the flesh,” he told Al Jazeera. .Khajah was not sure if Argentina would come out on top on Friday night. After all, they were facing a Dutch side that had been unbeaten in their last 20 World Cup matches against non-European opponents – winning 14 matches and drawing in six. You would have to travel way back to 1994 for the last defeat – a quarter-final loss to Brazil. .“Holland are very strong. So, I was not sure,” Khajah said. .“But I’m glad I came to watch because I saw the magician do amazing. I like him and Ronaldo. They are [in a] different class,” he said. .Savouring every moment of the win, many of the non-Argentinian Argentina fans were slow to exit the stadium long after the final whistle was blown. .“Amazing game. I will never forget. We played really well and Messi was great,” said Hani Albashir, who travelled from Saudi Arabia to watch his favourite team. .More than 30 minutes after the game had finished, Albashir was still in the stands taking selfies to remember the moment. .“I support Argentina because of the way they play the game. Beautiful, and they make it look simple and very natural. They play sexy football,” he added with a laugh. .He still could not believe he had just witnessed Argentina beat the Netherlands. .Before Friday’s match, Messi had nine World Cup goals for the Albicelestes – one behind Gabriel Batistuta, who is considered one of Argentina’s greatest strikers. In the 73rd minute of the game against the Netherlands, the little magician converted a penalty to equal Batistuta’s record. .“I came to witness history. And Messi made history tonight,” said Jasim Jamal, an IT technician from Kerala, India, clad in a Messi football jersey at Lusail Stadium. .“It’s a night I will never forget. Argentina don’t just play football. They entertain you,” said Jamal, adding there was “no team like Argentina”. .“Argentina play football the way it should be played no matter the opponent. It is why I will always support them,” he said. .Now Jamal said he would do anything to get his hands on a ticket for the semi-final. .“This opportunity doesn’t come around often,” he said. .Argentina now face Croatia who had earlier on Friday eliminated Brazil to book their place in the semi-finals. .But Argentina’s fans in Lusail think it is their time. .“With Messi in your team, anything is possible,” said Albashir, the supporter from Saudi Arabia. .“I have every faith we will win this World Cup.”",146

Lautaro Martinez scored their final spot kick and kept Argentina’s World Cup dreams alive. .The match took a long time to get going. But in the 35th minute, Lionel Messi – who else? – put together a moment of magic to thread an inch-perfect pass to Nahuel Molina in the box who wasted no time in burying the ball into the back of the net. .The game trundled on until a foul just inside the Dutch penalty area in the 72nd minute had the referee pointing to the spot, and Argentina’s record-breaking Number 10 stood forward once more. The Netherlands’s keeper Andries Noppert could only watch as Messi’s shot rocketed past him to double Argentina’s lead. .In the 83rd minute, five minutes after coming onto the pitch, Wout Weghorst found the net with the Netherlands’s first shot on goal. Two minutes later, Memphis Depay rocketed the ball into the side netting. .A bad-tempered match saw a fracas break out towards the end of normal time, with Argentina’s Leandro Paredes losing his cool and booting the ball into the Dutch dugout – the substitutes then storming onto the pitch. .That incident and the other frequent stoppages were enough to add 10 minutes to the clock and that was just enough. A free kick for the Netherlands in the 101st minute of normal time turned out to be a surprise training-ground exercise from the Dutch, as Teun Koopmeiners rolled the ball to the foot of the wall where Weghorst was waiting once more to turn and sweep a shot into the goal to bring the score to 2-2. .Extra time saw tempers flaring again but no goals despite chances at both ends. .The loss brings an end to 71-year-old Louis van Gaal’s tenure as coach of the Dutch national team. .Argentina will play Croatia – who sensationally knocked out five-time world champions Brazil, also on penalties – in the World Cup semi-final at Lusail Iconic Stadium on Tuesday.",148

This is an amazing feeling … to win when you were sure you were going to lose,” a 21-year-old David Smolgol told Al Jazeera on Friday. .“We are very small country, but God keeps helping us win. That must be it,” he said while raising his hands up to the sky. .Brazil looked set to win the highly charged contest after Neymar scored in the first half of extra time, sending the Brazilians into jubilation mode. However, Croatia, losing finalists in Russia 2018, scored in the dying minutes of the second half through striker Bruno Petkovic to send the game to penalties – with Croatia coming out on top 4-2. .Ivona Babic, another Croatian fan, described her team’s win as “unbelievable”. .“I was so sure we were going to lose after Neymar’s goal … I had given up all hope … but now we are going to the semifinals!” the Zagreb resident said. .“My heart needs a moment to calm down,” the 28-year-old from Zagreb told Al Jazeera. .At the final whistle the Croatia fans, who were overwhelmingly in the minority, took the celebrations outside where they chanted, “Bring back Brazil, so we can play.” .However, the Brazil fans were stunned by the loss. Tears streamed down some of their faces, including women and children, as others tried to console them, and each other. .Davide Gomes, 35-year-old salesperson from Rio De Janeiro, said it was an “awful” feeling to lose on penalties. .“Penalties are very painful. We were the better team, but what can you do, those are the rules of the game,” Soares, who lives Rio De Janeiro, told Al Jazeera. “I don’t think most Brazilians will be able to sleep tonight. It hurts a lot,” he added. .While there were not as many fans in Qatar, Croatians back home would surely be celebrating. .Mia Dopiec told Al Jazeera it will be a “very long night of drinking” back in the Croatian capital Zagreb where she lives. .“I am already getting messages from friends saying how lucky I am to be at the match today, and all the plans people are making to party,” the 21-year-old university student said. .On the prospects of facing Argentina or Netherlands in the semifinal, Dopiec simply said: “We are not afraid of anyone.

He entered the tournament two goals shy of the milestone, and scored his 76th in the round of 16 against South Korea after returning from an ankle injury. .Pele remained in a hospital in Brazil treating a respiratory infection that was aggravated by COVID-19. The latest medical report said the 82-year-old Pelé, who last year had surgery to remove a colon tumor, was doing OK. .The 30-year-old Neymar scored his 77 goals in 124 matches for Brazil. Pele’s goals came in 92 appearances with the national team between 1957 and 1971. .Ronaldo, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 2002, is third on the list with 62 goals in 98 matches. . .Neymar first played for Brazil as an 18-year-old in 2010. He is trying to win his first major title with the national team. Pele won three World Cups, including as a 17-year-old in the 1958 tournament. He also helped Brazil win the World Cup in 1962 and 1970. .Neymar is playing in his third World Cup and is the only other Brazil player other than Pele and Ronaldo to score in three different World Cups. He helped the Seleçao win the 2013 Confederations Cup and its first Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. .Neymar damaged ligaments in his ankle in Brazil’s opening win against Serbia, and his participation in the rest of the tournament was in doubt because of the injury. He made it back to the starting lineup after missing two group games, and played about 80 minutes in Brazil’s 4-1 win over South Korea on Monday. .He was knocked out of the 2014 World Cup after hurting his back in the quarterfinals against Colombia. Brazil eventually lost to Germany 7-1 in the semifinals. .The right ankle had already caused Neymar problems in the past, being among a series of injuries since the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Another right ankle sprain forced him to miss the 2019 Copa América, which Brazil won.",152
153,Published On 9 Dec 2022,"Which managers have resigned, been sacked after World Cup exits?",Failure to meet a nation’s expectations can cost a World Cup manager their job.,".With the weight of a whole nation resting on their shoulders, the World Cup can be a cut-throat football tournament for managers and coaches. .The World Cup 2022 is no exception. .This year’s tournament has already produced its fair share of upsets. As a result, there have already been a few managerial casualties. .Here are the managers who have left their posts: .Brazil: Tite .Brazil coach Adenor Leonardo Bacchi, known as “Tite”, had previously said he planned to step down after his contract ended in the wake of this year’s World Cup. .But that exit came faster than many expected, as the tournament favourites saw a one goal lead over Croatia in added time quickly evaporate during their quarterfinal match. Tied at 1-1, Croatia went on to win 4-2 on penalty kicks in front of shocked Brazilian players and fans. .The loss capped an uneven tournament for Brazil, a team that entered this year’s World Cup with one of the deepest decks of international talent of any side. The group stage had earlier included a surprise 0-1 loss to Cameroon after Brazil had already qualified for knockouts. .Tite took on the role of national team manager in 2016, leading Brazil to a quarterfinal exit in the 2018 World Cup and tournament victory in the 2019 Copa America. .“Sometimes we have a great performance, we shoot at goal, and the ball deviates. That’s normal. But I can respect the result,” he said after the Croatia match. “The loss hurts, but I’m at peace with myself right now.” .Netherlands: Louis van Gaal .Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal has said this bout as manager of the national team – his third – would be his final. The announcement came after The Netherlands lost to Argentina in their quarterfinal match, a raucous 2-2 nailbiter that saw the Dutch team come back from the brink to lose 3-4 on penalty kicks. .A coaching stalwart in European club football, van Gaal has become known for his – at times controversial – strategic decisions. Before his final World Cup match he batted away criticism that his team’s restrained play made for “boring” football, citing their success in topping their group stage and beating the USA handily in the Round of 16. .Van Gaal came out of retirement to take the reigns for a final time following the national team’s disappointing showing in Euro 2020. His first stint in the role – from 2000 to 2002 – saw the Netherland’s World Cup campaign fizzle without qualifying for the tournament. .His return from 2012 to 2014 saw the team reach the World Cup 2014 semifinals. .“I don’t think we have been beaten today. It was only a penalty shoot-out,” van Gaal said after the Argentina loss. “What I’m leaving behind is a great group.” .The Argentinian coach, Gerardo “Tata” Martino, who had previously managed Barcelona and Argentina, resigned after Mexico’s disastrous group-stage exit. El Tri played out a goalless draw with Poland in their opener, followed by a 2-0 loss to Argentina. Mexico finally scored in their final game against Saudi Arabia, winning 2-1, but it was not enough to progress to the last 16. .The last time Mexico had qualified for the tournament but failed to make it out of the knockout stage was in 1976. .After the match, Martino said, “As the person in charge, it causes a lot of sadness; I fully assume responsibility for this great failure.” .Martino had managed Mexico since January 2019 after winning the MLS Cup with Atlanta United. .The former Everton manager left his role as Belgium’s manager after they crashed out of the group stages despite heading into the tournament ranked second in the world. .The Spaniard has since claimed it was not a reaction to the loss, stating, “the decision was taken just before the World Cup, I always work towards the long-term projects and they need to be set in advance”. .Martinez took over the national side in 2016 and guided the Red Devils to third place in the 2018 World Cup and the Euro 2020 quarter-finals. . .The former Ghanaian international confirmed he would leave his role after his side finished bottom of the group despite some impressive performances. .Ghana picked up a win against South Korea but lost to Portugal and Uruguay. After their exit, Addo stated that it was a decision made before the tournament. Addo will return to his role as talent coach at German club Borussia Dortmund where he spent part of his career as a player. .The former Portuguese international ended his four-year tenure as South Korea’s manager after their last-16 exit to Brazil. South Korea drew with Uruguay, lost to Ghana and beat Portugal, securing four points in the group stage and qualification to the last 16. .However, Brazil ran rampant in the first half of their last-16 game, firing four past Kim Seung-gyu in goal. .  .The Spanish Football Association announced that Luis Enrique would be replaced by Spain under-21 manager Luis de la Fuente just two days after their shock World Cup exit to Morocco. .The former Barcelona manager had guided La Roja to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and the final of the Nations League in 2021. .Enrique took to social media following the announcement and thanked the FA, the players and the fans as he wished his replacement, De la Fuente, success in the role.",153
154,Published On 9 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: Why Morocco’s win over Spain means so much to me,"We’re used to losing. Morocco’s team is changing that, for the country and the Global South.",".Moroccan supporters flocked to Qatar looking for joy. They collectively needed something to feel happy about, removed from the many anxieties of life — an exhausting pandemic, a drought that has plagued our country, inflation and economic hardships. It seemed clear that mostly, we were all looking for a purpose, even if we did not realise it. .During the first days of the World Cup, I was mostly uninterested. I did not travel to Qatar, though like many others who work on documenting human rights abuses, I had followed the debate around the questions raised about the event this year. .As someone who grew up in a country where people kick the ball in street alleys and family feuds are born from disagreement over teams, I was also engaging, in part, in an act of self-preservation. I had gotten my heart broken too many times seeing our national squad play well but still lose. I have learned to preserve my feelings to not feel the crushing disappointment that has marked so many games since I was a child. Somewhere I believed that we were always set to fail, and I was done exposing myself to heart-wrenching sorrow. .But then the TikToks started pouring into my phone. I do not use social media, except for Twitter, and as minimally as I can because of my work, but the videos were so viral that I too got to see them. Seeing enthusiastic Moroccans cracking jokes and imposing our dialect in that part of the world viscerally fed into my deep love for football and my unconditional support for our team. Seeing Achraf Hakimi’s mother, who looks like so many Moroccan mothers, embrace her son after each victory, made my heart warm. .It was clear that the team felt comfortable in Qatar. Moroccan families felt at home in a more conservative setting, in a country whose language they spoke. Traditionally, the World Cup has been an event where Westerners, with their passport privileges, get to attend in huge numbers, while we watch from home, often unable to get the visa to travel to the country hosting the tournament. .This time was different, and the Moroccans showed up in large numbers to encourage the bearers of their nation’s flag. .The first round of the World Cup is usually predictable. The traditionally stronger teams — often the same ones again and again — make it to the knockout stages. But this time, Morocco made it to the round of 16 for the first time in 36 years, where we were up against a familiar opponent: our neighbour Spain. .As neighbours we hold a complicated relationship fraught with colonial history — we took turns colonising each other over centuries, and Spain still controls the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla — and also contemporary diplomatic tensions. It is also the home of a large Moroccan diaspora: Hakimi, the player who sent us into the quarter-finals was born in Madrid and chose to play for the Moroccan national team over the team of his birthplace. .I am not physically in Morocco at the moment yet have never felt closer to home. I watched the game in a bar in Washington, DC with a friend, who — though not Moroccan — was rooting for us, as we sat in a bar full of supporters of Spain. .When I was young, I would, during World Cup games, roll on the floor and beg God for a miracle. I am no longer that child. But a miracle did happen. When Hakimi scored the winning penalty for us, I blew up with indescribable joy. .Commentators joked about Morocco’s performances against Belgium and then Spain. “The Moroccan team is working its way through colonial powers like me eating a box of donuts,” wrote one. Moroccans and their supporters partied in many places around the world through the night. .That win gave us back our dignity after so many losses. “Raise your head, you are Moroccan,” said a sobbing commentator in Arabic. The words resonated viscerally in ways that will take time to unpack. .It turns out we were not the only ones elated. Millions of people around the world celebrated Morocco’s win at the World Cup. At that moment, it was possible for the Global South to unite behind that single moment of sheer happiness. A friend texted me after seeing United States Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s tweet cheering for Morocco: “Morocco has become the symbol of the victim of the West, of the underdog, of the one who never had a chance in this world and who rose above.” .It feels appropriate that this should be happening at what, in many ways, is a landmark sporting event for a post-colonial world. Instead of seeing inebriated Europeans take over cities, we are witnessing Africans and Arabs dancing, singing, and celebrating being together. .My friend, the University of Massachusetts epidemiologist Youssef Oulhote, is also one of the most fervent fans of the Moroccan side that I know. He summed up the moment for me. .“We feel pride, confidence, and hope,” he wrote to me. “We always had the feeling that we are an unlucky team in big competitions, but this time we feel that things go our way, and also that the team is solid and disciplined. That gives us hope and confidence.” .Whether Morocco win against Portugal in the quarter-finals on Saturday matters little at this point. We so badly needed this burst of optimism amid difficult times. .There is a joke doing the rounds that Morocco should bring coach Walid Regragui, fondly referred to as “avocado head” by the team’s supporters, into government and appoint him as a minister of happiness. I cannot think of a more appropriate recognition for him and his side. For, that is what this team has given all Moroccans, above all else. Happiness. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",154

A shock in the opening game against Saudi Arabia sent fans, who had been betting on some joy amid economic turmoil at home, reeling. .The spirits are higher again, however, as the side has shown progressively stronger performances, with flashes of brilliance from Messi and his teammates. .“Nervous” is how Matias, 15, one of the boys playing in the gym at Eros, summed up his feelings. .“I feel like Argentina can get to the final. I won’t say win it all, because I don’t want to jinx it, but we can get there,” he said. .It is difficult to overstate how big football is in Argentina. A pastime enmeshed so closely with national identity, the glory days of Maradona are a touchstone that no one will let go of. .Despite the painful inflationary crisis that has battered people’s wallets, Argentinians are among the highest ticket-purchasers for the tournament. Aerolineas Argentinas, the national carrier, launched a special flight to Qatar in time for the quarter-final which was sold out. .A livestream on Twitch by former footballer Sergio Aguero with Messi and other members of the team garnered 250,000 viewers. .“Whatever happens, for me you are all phenomenal people,” Aguero told the group. “Your victory always makes me very happy because it’s also mine.” .There is also the superstition that accompanies the World Cup. .Argentinians replicate behaviour that they come to associate with winning games. The boys at Eros all had theirs: Matias wears the same shorts and socks that he had during the wins. Santiago goes to the same restaurant and sits in the same chair with the same people for every game. .The World Cup is a unifying force in Argentina, Viviana Vila, a veteran sports journalist, said. .“It’s the only moment in which we are all brought to a standstill to live through the same emotion,” said Vila, who became the first Argentinian woman to do TV commentary during a World Cup in 2018. .“It might be joy, or it may be sadness. But for two or three hours, we will all live through the same emotion.” . .She added that the team has many things going for it beyond, of course, counting the best player in the world among its ranks. .“They are a group of players who are completely capable of facing these circumstances with a coaching team that is skilled, world class, young, and low profile.” .After their abysmal failure of the last World Cup in Russia, where Argentina lost to eventual winners France in the last 16, the momentum now is on Argentina’s side, she said. .“This is the best Messi,” she added. “The most mature. It’s a fantastic team. The truth is that you have to play each game. There’s not much more we can say about it.” .Back at Eros, a big Argentina flag drapes over the liquor cabinet in the clubhouse restaurant, as fans whir in the oppressive heat of December. .Murals of Maradona adorn the club’s 80-year-old façade. A crowd of locals that has gathered here to cheer at every Argentina match will be back again on Friday, said club member Marcelo Krimer, 39. .“Football represents everything that is good,” he said, noting that he means specifically the sport, not the national and international governing bodies that run it “like a mafia”. .At Eros, families find community and support. They often have to force people to leave at night by turning the lights off. .“This is gold for childhood,” said Krimer, looking around at the boys playing in the gym. “It helps us forget about everything. I always say that coming to the club, to this space, it’s like removing your brain and putting it in a bucket of ice,” he grinned. “Then you leave and return to your life, your family, your job.” .For Jorge del Rio, 70, the club is an oasis in a concrete jungle. He has run a football school for children at Eros for 30 years. In a city like Buenos Aires, “the potrero” – the Spanish word for pasture, or rural pitch – where people like Maradona cultivated their skills, has all but disappeared, he said. .“We used to play on the street, and a car would pass by every now and then,” he said. “You can’t do that any more.”",155

So he will be hoping for another good run in the quarter-finals. .Kahsef has looked at more than 200 metrics, including the number of wins, goals scored, FIFA rankings and more, from matches played over the past century and can barely separate the two teams. So this looks like it could be a  close match. .Kashef is marginally backing Lionel Messi’s Argentina – ranked third in the world – against an industrious Netherlands side. .Argentina were famously beaten 2-1 by Saudi Arabia in the group stage – a result Kashef failed to foresee – but have since beaten Poland, Mexico and Australia. . .The Netherlands have not lost yet at this World Cup. They have played a pragmatic style of football under Louis van Gaal. They will no doubt look to frustrate a talented Argentina side and hope to grab a goal (or two) from the in-form Cody Gakpo. .The Dutch have the edge on Argentina regarding their head-to-head record. This fixture is the third most frequently played at the World Cup, so Kashef has had plenty of data to analyse. They last met at the 2014 World Cup, where Argentina won on penalties. .After 56 matches this World Cup, Kashef has a 68-percent accuracy level.

159,Published On 9 Dec 2022,"Amid high expectations, Brazil aim for the ‘Hexa’ at World Cup","It has been 20 years since Brazil won the World Cup. Now, fans back home are hoping the team can bring back a sixth.",".Joao Pessao, Brazil – Brazil’s football team seems to have restored some of its mojo. But is that enough to win the World Cup in Qatar? .Judging by the mood back home, the answer is yes. Not many are doubting that the Seleção will win the title for a sixth time and the first time in 20 years. .Hemerson Cabral, 35, has noticed many changes in the building he works as a janitor in São Paulo, Brazil’s largest city. .Since the World Cup started last month, more Brazilian flags have been hanging out of windows and residents are immersed in the tournament. .“When Brazil are playing, many people finish work so they get back home earlier to watch it with the family or with the neighbours,” Cabral said, adding that he believes Brazil will beat France in the final. .“They are the only obstacle. It will be a great match and Brazil will win. The atmosphere at Brazil matches is second to none. I don’t think there are football fans like us. We enter the pitch with the players.” .Cabral is not the only one to believe in the Hexa (a sixth World Cup title for Brazil). According to a survey carried out by Apoema research, 71 percent of Brazilians think Brazil will win the title this year. .Football has been the country’s main talking point in the last few weeks. Everyone has an opinion. The World Cup and the team are dominating conversations in bars, work meetings and taxi rides. .Rio de Janeiro is hosting a FIFA Fan Festival, where people can watch the matches and concerts. The city is also hosting themed parties until the final on December 18. .The World Cup is also helping businesses boost their sales. Brazilian jerseys are seen everywhere. .When the World Cup started, Cintia Sampaio, 30, was surprised by the demand for jerseys at her shop in João Pessoa. .“The sales started to increase during the elections [in November] because people wore it [jersey] for the politics side of things,” Sampaio said. .“The World Cup started just after the elections, and it was insane. I was selling hundreds of jerseys daily, and it was so busy at the shop that I didn’t have the chance to have breakfast or lunch.” .Sampaio added that the blue jerseys have become very popular this year. .“I don’t have them now.” .Brazil’s passion for football is undeniable, but some people were concerned politics could outshine the matches. Unlike other years, the World Cup vibe just took over the country when the competition started on November 20. .In the last few years, Brazil has become highly divided by politics and national icons such as the Brazilian flag and yellow jersey have become a symbol of the extreme right. .Now, the streets are covered with green and yellow, and the mood across the country seems lighter, thanks to football. .“I think we are going through a moment of renovation in the country, we are happier,” said Melissa Paulino, 31. .“At least for me, it brings an extra level of excitement and energy to support Brazil. I believe the Hexa is coming now. It has been 20 years since we won the World Cup, so it is time, right?” .Like many others in the country, Paulino’s routine changes when Brazil plays. She makes sure to be free so she can focus on the game. .“It has been a long time since I felt so thrilled. I have mixed feelings about the match against Croatia. I’m also nervous because we can’t lose. .“I don’t have a ritual for watching the match but if I wear something when Brazil wins, I keep wearing it for the next matches. As you can imagine, the jersey I wore during the 7-1 [Brazil’s loss to Germany in World Cup 2014 semi-finals] doesn’t exist any more.” .But despite the widespread hope and optimism, some Brazilians believe the current side is not the best the country has seen. .Luciano Valente, 44, is concerned because “the players are childish, and they rely on Neymar too much”. .“We won most matches because the teams we faced weren’t at the top of their games,” Valente said. “From now on, we are going to compete with teams that are more aggressive and prepared. Do we have a chance to win? Sure, but we need emotional intelligence.” .Even those who aren’t usually football fans seem to enjoy the World Cup vibe. .Rosa Maria Ferreira, 72, likes watching the games alone at home. “I believe we’re going to win 4-0 against Croatia.” .Brazil won the last of its five world titles in 2002. Gabriel Furtado, 15, was not born then. .“I have never seen Brazil win a World Cup, so I have high expectations this year. I believe we have many chances to win. I am thrilled, I think we are going to beat Croatia,” said Furtado. .Like Paulino, Furtado also believes he can help the Seleção. .“I watch it with my family or with my school friends. Brazil won the matches I watched at home, so the quarter-final, I will watch it with my family.”",159
160,Published On 9 Dec 2022,Is World Cup 2022 moving football’s future further east?,"With global exposure and fan love, Asian and African teams are redefining the sport’s future.",".The global nature of football has always been the heart of its popularity. .The sport is played and understood in pretty much every country, and nothing captures its universal appeal like the international following that the World Cup draws every four years. .Yet something deeper appears to be afoot at the Qatar World Cup: The epicentre of a sport that has been dominated through its modern history by teams from Europe and South America may be shifting a bit to the east. .This is the first time that four teams from Asia and Africa qualified for the knockout stages of the competition – five if one includes Australia, which is part of the Asian Football Confederation. .Teams from the two continents have upset each of the world’s four top-ranked teams: Cameroon (ranked 43rd in the world) beat top-ranked Brazil, Morocco (22nd) defeated second-ranked Belgium, Saudi Arabia (51st) stunned Argentina, and Tunisia (30th) shocked France. .As if that wasn’t enough, Japan (24th) upset Germany (11th) and South Korea (28th) defeated Portugal (ninth). .On Tuesday, Morocco added to its scalps by beating Spain – ranked seventh – in the round of 16. And all of this at the first World Cup hosted in the Middle East. .So what’s behind this spate of giant slayings? .These up-and-coming countries have been working on strengthening their footballing structures, and the national teams have players on some of the most competitive teams in Europe, which brings them valuable exposure. .Whether it is Japan’s Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal), South Korea’s Son Heung-min (Tottenham Hotspur) or Moroccan hero Achraf Hakimi (Paris Saint-Germain), these players have competed against the best, making them fearless on the global stage, according to analysts. .“One of Japan’s biggest problems historically, as a national team, is that they’ve often played with too much respect for higher-ranked opponents and it cost them winnable results on big stages,” said Dan Orlowitz, a sports writer at the Japan Times. “The biggest thing the team gains from having so many players in Europe is that they are facing world-class opposition every week.” .Unlike Japan’s squad in the 1998 World Cup, the team that played in Qatar has players who start in the big European leagues and play in UEFA’s top competitions, Orlowitz said. “You don’t have to be scared of Germany and Spain if you’re used to playing them in different uniforms,” he said, “and that fearlessness is a big factor behind Japan’s wins.” .That’s also true for Arab and African nations. .Morocco’s squad has the most overseas-born players of any side in the World Cup, and while not many play in the big European clubs, the country’s dual citizenship rules allow it to tap the best talent on offer from the diaspora. .Orlowitz is convinced that Japan’s performances before the loss to Croatia are also a reflection of the growth of the game at the grassroots level – in particular, the establishment of youth academies “that are capable of producing world-class talent on a regular basis”. .One of the initiatives that Orlowitz cites as particularly critical is “Project DNA”, established by the J.League “to codify best practices and develop coaches and staff who can support these academies”, he said. .The World Cup has also helped shine a light on success stories from Saudi Arabia’s club structure: Most of the players who stunned Argentina 2-1 early in the tournament play for Al Hilal. The Saudi club reached the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in February before losing to Chelsea. Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has been linked to a possible transfer to Al Nassr, also one of Saudi Arabia’s most successful clubs. .South Korea, which like Japan reached the round of 16, might have benefited also from their domestic competition, the K League, finishing early this year, allowing a short training camp for the national team. Most European leagues have overlapped with the World Cup this year. .At the same time, this World Cup has also pivoted towards fans in the east. .“The feasibility in terms of distance and pricing for Asian countries” has helped bring unprecedented numbers of fans from the continent to Qatar, said Chelston Pinto, conditioning coach as well as a player for Indian football club Bengaluru United. He has come to Qatar to attend the World Cup as a fan. .“World Cups are an experience like no other and I’m sure fans in Asia did not want to miss out on this one,” Pinto said. .Hayya Card holders who have match tickets do not need a visa to enter Qatar. Flights are cheaper and the distance from other Asian countries is less. And most Asian and African countries are well-connected to the Middle East. .At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, there were more Chinese than English ticket holders, even though China had not qualified and England were among the favourites. In the current World Cup, Saudi Arabians and Indians submitted the most requests for entry permits into Qatar for the tournament. .All of this coincides with the growing attention major European clubs are showering on Asian markets. After all, fans from countries that aren’t represented in the competition have been supporting sides like Argentina, Brazil, England, and Germany, following footballers they watch year-round playing for popular European clubs. .Earlier this year, Manchester United toured Thailand and Australia, while Liverpool played against Crystal Palace in Singapore. Tottenham Hotspur travelled to South Korea – home of their talisman striker Son Heung-min. .The traditional footballing elite in Europe appear to recognise that the sport’s future is shifting east. The success of Asian and African teams at the Qatar World Cup, and the passion of their fans, will likely only speed up that process.",160
161,Published On 9 Dec 2022,Netherlands vs Argentina preview: World Cup 2022 quarter-final,Argentina’s coach predicts a “beautiful game” against the Netherlands; winner to take on Brazil or Croatia in the semis.,".Who: Argentina vs Netherlands .Where: Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar .When: Friday, December 9, 2022, 10pm (19:00 GMT) .Argentina’s coach has predicted a “beautiful game” against the Netherlands when the two sides meet in Friday’s World Cup quarter-final. .The tantalising clash between two of the great teams of world football at the 89,000-capacity Lusail Stadium comes after Lionel Scaloni’s men edged past Australia 2-1 in the last 16 and his veteran counterpart Louis van Gaal led the Dutch to a 3-1 win over the USA. .“It’s going to be a very beautiful game, with two historic teams. Sadly one team has to lose and we hope it’s us who go through,” Argentina’s Scaloni told reporters last Sunday. .“We face a difficult opponent, like all of them, and we hope to do well. Maybe they are not shining like past Dutch teams, but they are very clear in what they do.” .Lionel Messi, Argentina’s captain and talisman, was similarly clear on Sunday about the task ahead. .“They have great players and a great coach, it’s going to be hard-fought,” he said, a day after scoring against Australia in his 1,000th career appearance. “It’s the quarter-finals of a World Cup and if a World Cup has been tough from the start, it gets even tougher at this stage.” .The 35-year-old’s influence in Qatar has grown game by game. Messi has scored three goals so far, and he now stands just three wins away from delivering Argentina a third World Cup trophy. .Messi’s increasingly impressive performances have dovetailed with Argentina’s growing stature as the tournament has developed, putting aside an opening shock 2-1 defeat to Saudi Arabia to win three games on the bounce since then, scoring five goals and conceding just once in the process. .The Netherlands, meanwhile, will be focused on blunting Messi in a matchup that will pit the diminutive forward against Virgil van Dijk – the Netherlands’ colossal captain and one of the world’s best centre backs – while causing Scaloni’s charges problems of their own. .Van Gaal’s side has been buoyed by the return to fitness of skillful attacker Memphis Depay and the continued good form of frontman Cody Gakpo, who has netted three times in Qatar. .Similar to the strategy they employed against the USA, the Dutch may be content to again concede control of the ball for long stretches and threaten on the counterattack, exposing any spaces left at the back by La Albiceleste. .Van Gaal has been under pressure in Qatar since declaring the Oranje were capable of becoming world champions for the first time. He has also faced criticism over his side’s alleged conservatism, with Dutch teams traditionally known for more expansive football. .But the performance against the USA was a notable demonstration of what the Netherlands can produce, with Depay’s opening goal, which came on the back of a majestic 21-pass sequence, a graphic reminder of their quality. .Van Dijk said on Wednesday that his team have the hunger and the desire to go all the way in Qatar. .“We just want to go out there and show our quality, show the team spirit, show the togetherness that we have and progress, hopefully, to the next stage,” he told reporters. .“We know that we are three games away from glory,” he added. “We want to perform and leave it all on the pitch and hopefully get success. And this is our opportunity and hopefully we can enjoy the opportunity and go through as well.” .The winners of Friday’s clash will face either Croatia or Brazil in the semi-finals.",161

And as World Cup finalists in 2018, they know how to play and perform in high-pressure matches. .The Croats famously played out three rounds of extra time over the knockout stages on their way to that World Cup final in Russia. This year, they overcame Japan on penalties in the round of 16. .If Brazil enjoy another bright start to this game, they will need to be careful not to let complacency set in, or Croatia could punish them. .Richarlison, Brazil’s top scorer in the tournament so far, enjoyed another fine game against South Korea, netting his third goal in as many games. .Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar returned from a group-stage injury to put in an impressive performance against South Korea and looks set to play on Saturday. .Even as Brazil look to overwhelm a disciplined Croatian backline with attacking flair, they can also rely on Liverpool’s Alisson in goal and Chelsea’s Thiago Silva at the centre of defence to keep the danger of Croatia’s star playmaker Luka Modric at bay. .Croatia have only conceded two goals so far this tournament, but it could easily have been more if Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku had been able to finish any of his gilt-edged chances in their final group game. .Brazil are undefeated against Croatia in their four previous games. If Croatia break that pattern on Friday, they will enter their third World Cup semi-final. After finishing in third place in 1998, they were runners-up in 2018 and a win over Brazil would allow them to dream of going all the way this time. .But they’re up against the most successful nation in the sport’s history. If Brazil win, they will enter the semi-finals for the ninth time. And if the five-time champions needed any incentive to strive for a sixth world title, the hospitalisation of Pele has served to bind their country, its fans and players in a single prayer to win the World Cup for the legend. .The winner of the Brazil-Croatia quarter-final will play the team that comes out on top in the game between Argentina and the Netherlands, also on Friday.",162

The Paris Saint-Germain forward is now one goal shy of tying Pele’s 77 goals as Brazil’s all-time highest scorer. Neymar, 30, could even the score with Pele on Friday, as the team rallies around the legendary footballer, 82, who was hospitalised last week with a respiratory infection amid his battle with colon cancer. . .Croatia, who stunned Japan 3-1 on penalties in their first elimination match after drawing 1-1 — their third tie of the tournament, apart from steamrolling Canada 4-1 — head into Friday’s match a colossal underdog, despite their runner-up finish at the 2018 World Cup. .FIFA fined Croatia 50,000 Swiss francs ($53,000) on Wednesday for verbal abuse the Adriatic nation’s fans inflicted upon Canadian goalkeeper, Milan Borjan, in the two teams’ group stage clash. .Netherlands vs Argentina .The Netherlands, led by the tournament’s oldest coach, the orange tie-wearing, 71-year-old “Iron Tulip” Louis van Gaal, head into Friday’s match with Lionel Messi and company on the heels of a 19-game winning streak nearly a week after ousting the USA in the round of 16. .Dutch star Cody Gakpo, who has wrought havoc on opponents with a trio of goals at the 2022 World Cup, is trailing France’s Kylian Mbappe by two goals for the coveted Golden Boot. .Messi, who scored his first knockout round goal in Argentina’s 2-1 roasting of Australia, his ninth in 23 World Cup games, will look to tie with La Albiceleste legend Gabriel Batistuta as the team’s all-time leading tournament scorer in Friday’s match. It’s not only do or die for Argentina — but Messi, too. The football superstar, who has yet to hoist the Coupe du Monde, is playing in his fifth and likely final World Cup. .The Netherlands have only lost once in the past nine contests against Argentina — the 1978 World Cup final in Buenos Aires. They’ve twice been beaten in a shootout by Argentina, however, the most recent coming during a scoreless 2014 semi-final that resulted in Argentina winning on penalties.",163

A team in the true sense of the word, who will fight for the dream to the end! Believe with us!” .Ronaldo, who led the national squad in training on Thursday, was benched by coach Fernando Santos for the start of Portugal’s round-of-16 clash against Switzerland. .The five-time Ballon d’Or winner only came on in the 73rd minute. .It was the first time that Portugal’s all-time top goal scorer was not named in the national starting team for a game at a major tournament since 2008. .Goncalo Ramos, the youngster named in Ronaldo’s place in the starting 11, who was just two years old when Ronaldo made his international debut, burst onto the world stage with a hat-trick in the absence of the old master. .The team scored five goals without his iconic presence on the field, with the game finishing 6-1 to the Navigators. .“He hasn’t spoken to us about it because he never wanted to leave,” Portuguese midfielder Otavio told reporters. .“On the contrary, he always wants to help, playing or not playing. As I have said, he is our captain and when he talks to us it’s only to say good things. The national team supports him, there is not doubts about it.” .Ronaldo has been cast adrift at this World Cup, leaving his Manchester United club during the tournament amid a media implosion in which he lashed out at the team manager and the club’s owners. .His future has remained unclear, and with few clubs with pockets deep enough to afford his wage bill, several reports have suggested he will go on to play for the Al-Nassr megaclub in Saudi Arabia after the World Cup. .Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti also sprang to Ronaldo’s defence, highlighting his professionalism during his time at the Spanish club. .“I’ve coached him for two years and there were no problems,” he told Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport. “In fact, he solved them for me.

165,Published On 8 Dec 2022,Spain replace coach Luis Enrique after early World Cup exit,Luis de la Fuente to lead national football team after shock defeat to Morocco in the round of 16 of the tournament in Qatar.,".Spain’s shock loss to Morocco and elimination from the men’s World Cup has triggered changes for the country’s national football team, with coach Luis Enrique replaced by Luis de la Fuente. .The Spanish football federation on Thursday thanked Enrique but said it was time to “start a new project” following Tuesday’s defeat. The change was made after a recommendation from Spain’s sporting officials. .The 61-year-old de la Fuente, a former left-back with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao, helped Spain’s under-19 squad win the European Championship in 2015, and the under-21 team win Euro 2019. He also coached Spain’s squad at the Tokyo Olympic Games, where they won a silver medal. .De la Fuente also once coached the senior national team when youth players were used in a friendly against Lithuania because the main squad had to go into isolation because of the coronavirus. .Other candidates who had been considered included former Belgium manager Roberto Martínez and ex-Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelino García Toral. .Spain got off to a good start in Qatar, routing Costa Rica 7-0. But La Roja did not win again in the group stages, drawing 1-1 with Germany and losing 2-1 to Japan before being knocked out in the round of 16 by Morocco on penalties after a goalless draw in normal and extra time. .Enrique, a Barcelona legend, took over the national team in 2018 to start revamping the squad after its elimination in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia. He temporarily left because of the illness and eventual death of his young daughter but returned in 2019. .He helped Spain reach the last four of the Nations League twice, including this season and last year when it lost the final to France. .He also led Spain to the semi-finals of the European Championship last year, losing to Italy in a penalty shootout. .The 52-year-old’s contract had been due to end after the World Cup. Moments after the loss to Morocco, he said he would take some time to rest before starting talks with the federation about his future. .The team’s elimination in Qatar raised more questions about whether Spain, the 2010 world champions, should start overhauling their football philosophy and get rid of the “tiki-taka” ball-possession style that has not produced much in the ways of recent results. Enrique had said he was not planning to relinquish the “tiki-taka” if he remained as a coach, and de la Fuente also is likely to keep it alive. .Football analyst Gemma Soler told Al Jazeera that Enrique’s removal did not come as a surprise following the “disaster” in Qatar and described de la Fuente’s appointment as “an internal solution”. .“He’s been the under-21 coach so he knows all this young generation of Spanish new players,” Soler said, adding that the new coach might share his predecessor’s football ideas but in terms of character, the two men are quite different. .“Luis Enrique has such a [strong] personality, he likes to speak and to be in the spotlight, while Luis de la Fuente is the opposite.” .De la Fuente is expected to make his debut with the senior team when Spain resume playing in qualifying for Euro 2024, facing Norway in their opening match of the campaign on March 25 next year.",165

Brazil coach Tite had joined in the dance. .“[Scoring] goals is the most important thing in football,” said the Real Madrid star. “[The dancing] shows – not just that we are happy – but the whole country is happy for us now at the World Cup.” .The dancing was “disrespectful” to their opponents, said Keane, now a pundit whose cultivated surliness is a hallmark of his media profile. .“They’re doing it every time,” Keane told ITV. “I don’t mind the first kind of little jig – whatever they’re doing – but they’re still doing it after that and then the manager getting involved with it. I’m not happy with it, I don’t think it’s very good at all.” .But Vinicius Jr disagreed, “Hopefully, we still have a lot of goals to celebrate, to keep dancing, playing well and reaching the final with this rhythm. Of course, people always like to complain when they see others happy. But Brazilian people are always very happy, so we will always look to positively affect others. Hopefully, we can continue to express our joy. There are more people supporting us than are against us.” .Tite, who has announced he will be retiring after this World Cup campaign, backed up his player – but said he understood the optics. .“There are always spiteful people who will understand it as disrespect. I told the players to hide me a little, I know about the visibility,” he said. “I didn’t want it to have any other interpretation than the joy of the goal, the result, the performance, but not disrespect for the opponent or [South Korea coach] Paulo Bento, for whom I have a lot of respect.” Brazil won 4-1. .Brazil’s flamboyant footballing style has always brought the carnival to the pitch; the samba nation’s side is known for the showboating tricks and flicks that make the team a delight to watch for millions around the globe. .Former Watford striker Richarlison has a tendency to celebrate his goals with a pigeon dance, joined by other players and team officials nearby. .But the World Cup has long had a tradition of introducing fans to spectacular moves better suited to the dance floor. For many, the 1990 World Cup in Italy will always be remembered for the great Roger Milla, the 38-year-old Cameroonian star who set the world alight in Italy in 1990 with his moves at the corner flag after scoring in the round of 16 against Colombia. . .That started the craze of elaborate goal celebrations. Brazil’s Bebeto in 1994, celebrated not only his goals — he scored three at the World Cup — but the recent arrival of his newborn child, with the “baby-rocking” gesture. . .Keane himself found his own exuberant goal celebration going viral on Twitter this week, after he scored in the BBC vs ITV five-a-side match in Qatar. The pundit scored the winning goal, before taking his shirt off and jumping over a bin. .",167

169,Published On 8 Dec 2022,‘World will take note:’ Saudi fans on Ronaldo link to local club,The Portuguese superstar has reportedly received a tantalising offer from Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr club.,".Doha, Qatar – Cristiano Ronaldo may have spent most of Portugal’s round-of-16 game against Switzerland on the bench, but his late introduction was greeted by deafening cheers from thousands of fans at Lusail Stadium on Tuesday night. .Many of them were not even Portuguese fans. Ronaldo is a massive crowd pull around the world, in leagues, exhibition matches and now at the World Cup. But while the 37-year-old is likely playing his last World Cup, fans in the Middle East might soon see him play locally again. .After being let go by Manchester United last month, Ronaldo has been linked to Al Nassr, a Saudi Pro League (SPL) club. While confirmation of a move is still pending – and is not likely to be announced until after the World Cup – Saudi football fans say they can’t wait to have the Portuguese legend in their midst. .“Who doesn’t want to see Ronaldo play live? I don’t support Al Nassr but I want him to come to Saudi Arabia,” Ibrahim Al Hassun, a Saudi football fan told Al Jazeera in Doha. .Ronaldo holds the record for most international goals (118) and is the most capped international player for Portugal with 195 appearances. Yet there’s a cloud over his future in Portugal’s national team. .He has scored one goal at the tournament so far and was dropped from the starting lineup for Portugal’s last game. His replacement, Goncalo Ramos, scored a hat-trick and is likely to start in the quarterfinal against Morocco on Saturday. .Al Nassr is the second-most successful club in the SPL, with nine titles to its name, and has reportedly offered Ronaldo a $225mn-a-year contract for three years. .Saudi fans are relishing the prospect of having one of football’s biggest names ply his trade in their country. .Al Hassun said the biggest impact of Ronaldo’s reported move will be in terms of the attention he will bring to Saudi football. “The whole world will take note of Saudi football – from the media to the fans around the world, and social media. It will be phenomenal.” .If it’s attention that Saudi fans are seeking, they have received plenty of it with their team’s performance at the World Cup. According to figures released by World Cup host broadcasters beIN, Saudi Arabia’s famous win over Argentina in their opening game of the World Cup attracted 99.3mn eyeballs, of which more than 80mn  were international viewers. .Muhammad, a Saudi fan from Riyadh, said the national team has improved by leaps and bounds since the last World Cup but the world only took notice when they beat Lionel Messi-led Argentina. According to Muhammad, Ronaldo’s presence will help local players grow and deal with the pressure of big games. “Ronaldo will make a lot of money from (playing in) our country, so we need to ensure our players make the most of his presence too,” he said. .While most names on the roster of SPL teams are local, international footballers have been playing in the country. Brazilian forward Anderson Talisca signed for Al Nassr last year, while Argentinian midfielder Ever Banega has been playing for Riyadh-based club Al Shabab since 2020. .Hassan Ali, a fan of Al-Ittehad FC in Jeddah, said that while the SPL has a great following within the country and the region, it largely goes unnoticed in other parts of the world due to a lack of international stars. .That could now change. “No matter what people say about his age and goal-scoring ability, Ronaldo will help put Saudi football on the world map,” said Ali.",169
170,Published On 8 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: Sterling to return to Qatar after home break-in,The England winger is said to have asked if he can return to Qatar ahead of the quarter-final against France.,".England’s Football Association (FA) have confirmed that Raheem Sterling will return to the England camp in Al Wakrah on Friday ahead of their quarter-final clash against France on Saturday. .The Chelsea and England winger returned to his home in southwest England last Sunday after it was broken into by “armed intruders”, according to the player’s representative. .Surrey police later confirmed they were investigating a report of stolen jewellery and watches but no threats of violence had been reported. .Sterling is said to have been “shaken” by the incident and feared for the safety of his fiancee and three children. Since his return, he has worked on improving security arrangements for his home. .It is understood that on Wednesday, he asked the English Football Association to be allowed to return to Qatar. On Thursday, the FA confirmed that he is expected to rejoin the squad in Al Wakrah. . .Sterling started in England’s first two games; a 6-2 win over Iran where he scored, and a goalless draw against the USA. However, he was dropped for their final group match against Wales and was forced to miss their 3-0 victory over Senegal in the last 16 after returning home following the break-in. .Unbeaten England will face current world champions France on Saturday. France brushed aside Poland in the last 16 with Kylian Mbappe bagging a brace, making it five goals in four matches for the Paris Saint-Germain forward. .The quarter-final between England and France will kick off at 10pm (19:00 GMT) on Saturday at the Al Bayt Stadium.",170
171,Published On 7 Dec 2022,FIFA fines Croatia over fans’ abuse of Canadian goalkeeper,Penalty from world football’s governing body comes 48 hours before Croatia face Brazil in the World Cup quarter-finals.,".FIFA has sanctioned World Cup quarter-finalists Croatia for abuse its supporters levelled at Canada’s goalkeeper during the two countries’ group-stage clash in Qatar last month. .World football’s governing body said on Wednesday that its Disciplinary Committee had fined the Croatian Football Federation 50,000 Swiss francs ($53,000) in relation to the behaviour of the Adriatic nation’s fans at the match on November 27. .During the fixture at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, Croatian supporters were reported to have shouted insults at Milan Borjan, an ethnic Serb, who was born in Croatia but fled the country as a child. .He and his family left their hometown – situated in an ethnic Serbian region of Croatia – when it was taken by Croatian forces during a 1995 military operation that ended the Croatian War of Independence. .During and after the manoeuvre, labelled “Operation Storm”, an estimated 200,000 ethnic Serbs fled the country, many on tractors. .One banner displayed by Croatia fans during their side’s 4-1 victory was a flag of tractor manufacturer John Deere with the company’s slogan changed to read, “Nothing runs like Borjan”. .FIFA said its charge against Croatia related to breaches of article 16 of its disciplinary code, namely the “use of words and objects to transmit a message that is not appropriate for a sports event”. . .There was no immediate response to FIFA’s announcement from Croatia or Canada’s football governing bodies, or from Borjan himself. .The governing body’s punishment came just 48 hours before Croatia take on Brazil in the last-eight on Friday. Canada were eliminated from the tournament in the group stages. .FIFA also fined the Football Association of Serbia 20,000 Swiss francs ($21,200) on Wednesday for a controversial flag depicting neighbouring Kosovo hung up in the team’s dressing room during their group-stage game against Brazil on November 24. .It showed a map of Serbia that included the territory of its former province and the slogan “No Surrender”. .The Football Federation of Kosovo had filed a complaint with FIFA about the flag, which was hung over two Serbian players’ lockers. . .Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but Belgrade does not recognise the statehood of its former province. Most Western countries, including the United States, do. .In a third case of disciplinary action, FIFA’s Disciplinary Committee handed the Saudi Arabian Football Association a 30,000 Swiss francs ($32,000) penalty for “team misconduct” after the Green Falcons collected six yellow cards during their group-stage matches against Argentina and Mexico on November 22 and November 30, respectively. .Both Serbia and Saudi Arabia failed to qualify for the World Cup’s knockout phase. There was no immediate response from either country’s footballing governing body to the fines imposed by FIFA.",171
172,Published On 7 Dec 2022,"In Doha, lull in football action no match for World Cup buzz","End of round of 16 gives way to a two-day break before quarter-finals. So, how are local residents and visitors filling the football void?",".Doha, Qatar – After 17 days of nearly round-the-clock World Cup action, Monal Iyer says it is time for a breather. .“We need a break; the football has been non-stop, every day,” the 40-year-old businessman from Mumbai, India, told Al Jazeera on Wednesday, the first day without a match since the opening of the tournament in Qatar on November 20. .“Now, a two-day break, and then I’ll be watching Argentina in Lusail – that will be amazing,” he said, before descending into the cavernous depths of Al Bidda metro station in central Doha. .He was on his way to Souq Waqif, a charming bazaar that has been buzzing with locals and tourists day and night since football came to town. .“Yesterday, we went to sleep very late, but we woke up and came straight to the market to have some Qatari breakfast, buy spices and souvenirs. We enjoyed it a lot,” said Ignacio, a 29-year-old consultant from La Paz, Bolivia, who is visiting Qatar along with another Bolivian and an Italian friend. .“It’s nice to have a little bit of a recovery, because it’s been very fast-paced – but we will miss football,” added Ignacio, who supports Brazil. .Thankfully for him, his favourite team will be the first back in action on Friday when they face Croatia to kick off the quarter-final stage at 6pm (15:00 GMT), before Argentina and the Netherlands square off at 10pm (19:00 GMT). .The other two quarter-finals will be played on Saturday, with Morocco facing Portugal and England taking on France. . .Whatever the results, Souq Waqif will be lively. The bazaar has emerged as the top destination for post-match celebrations – whether it is Saudi Arabia fans after the shock victory over Argentina in the early days of the World Cup, or Morocco supporters following the Atlas Lions’ heroics against Spain on Tuesday evening. .On Wednesday afternoon, Morocco fans were still jubilant. .“We had our tickets to go back [tonight], but we changed it to stay here for three more days and support Morocco,” said Mohamed, a 41-year-old finance professional. .In-between taking photographs of the souq, he said he planned to use the current lull in the action to tick some items off his Qatar bucket list. .“[It is the] best time to visit Doha; we are trying to go to many places, like the Museum of Islamic Art and the Corniche.” .Indeed, the IM Pei-designed museum and the nearby Corniche were on most visitors’ lips when asked how they planned to fill the two-day football void. Others had arranged desert safaris, trips to shopping centres or a night out at one of the several fan zones dotting Doha. .“This is a cool time to let us know this city and the country,” Maxwell Chen, a Chinese national who works for a solar energy company in Bangkok, Thailand, said of the break. “I want to get to know the culture and the food.” .Still, Menal, from Muscat, Oman, who is visiting with her family other Omani friends residing in Qatar, said she would miss football on Wednesday and Thursday. .“Qatar is more of a quiet country,” added her friend, Issam, a hospital worker. “So all this activity is something nice for us, and we are going to miss it, even after the World Cup,” he said. .“We don’t want it quiet. But I don’t think, apart from not having a match, that it will be quiet [tonight]. Everyone will still be going out and it won’t be different.” .Sanjib Khatri, a waiter at Football Coffee, a popular spot off Al Bidda Park for residents to watch the matches, agreed that the atmosphere has been very lively. .“Business has [taken] off,” he said, describing his workload during the last two-and-a-half weeks. .“It’s an exciting moment. We see people from all over the world,” added Khatri, who is from Nepal. “It will be nice for the football to start again, it will be good,” he said. “We need to work more.” .Sunil Kumar Sah, another Nepalese who drives a lime-coloured motorcycle around Doha making food deliveries, said he was expecting to be even busier in the days ahead. .“Sitting is no good, so I need to [do the] deliveries,” he said, adding that he was handling more orders during the World Cup. .For others who have also been busy working during the month-long event, this current break from football was needed to catch up with some of the action. .“Most of the time we follow the World Cup on our cell phones, on news websites, checking social media,” said Mohamed Reza, a limousine driver. “We don’t have the time, but today and tomorrow, we will have some and we can review all the videos.” .As for those tasked with capturing that action, Wednesday also provided a welcome and necessary respite. .“I’ve followed 17 matches in a row, so a lot of work to do,” Paolo Tomaselli, a reporter with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, said at Souq Waqif. “First time here to enjoy a couple of hours of relaxation … before working again in the afternoon. .“There are no full days off when there’s a World Cup.” .The next brief breather, perhaps, will come between the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, on December 11 and 12.",172
173,Published On 7 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: Palestine beats Israel on football’s big stage,How Palestine won Qatar 2022 without even playing in it.,".The FIFA World Cup in Qatar is still underway, but there is already one early winner: Palestine. It is scoring in the hearts and minds of fans from across the world. .Looking at the abundant number of Palestinian flags, seeing the Palestinian armbands and bracelets, and hearing the “free Palestine” chants at the stadiums, fan zones, in the streets and on social media, one may think that Palestine is among the 32 countries whose teams have participated in this World Cup. Indeed, some Latin American media outlets have branded it the “33rd country” at the tournament. .But the Palestinian national team is not playing, so why is Palestine so ubiquitously present? .It is because the World Cup is much more than a sporting event. It is a huge gathering of people from around the world coming together to share their passion for football and celebrate diversity and human solidarity. .This year’s edition of the World Cup is the first one ever to be held in an Arab country. Hence, it has been more accessible – geographically, logistically and culturally – to people from the region than any previous World Cup. It has also given people from the region space to gather in large numbers without the usual fear of repression. .As a result, Palestine has automatically taken centre stage, uniting Arabs in a joyful and celebratory atmosphere and reaffirming their commitment to the Palestinian cause. .In this rare Arab vox populi moment, supporting Palestine appears to be an expression of freedom, a symbol of resistance not only against the continuous occupation of Palestine but also against the neo-colonial order of repressive Arab regimes. It brings memories of powerful moments during the attempted revolutions from more than a decade ago when Arabs also flew the Palestinian flag and chanted “free Palestine” alongside their demands for freedom and dignity. .Indeed, the Palestinian flag is a sign of Arab political agency and has been a constant feature in the stands at football matches. .We saw a big one unfurled at the Tunisia-Australia match on November 26 and then another one at the Morocco-Belgium match a day later. The giant flag kept coming back in subsequent matches. .At the Tunisia-France game, a Tunisian fan waving the Palestinian flag ran onto the field and did a few flips in the air before being forcibly escorted out by security; his feat inspired “Falastin, Falastin!” (Arabic for Palestine) chants in the audience. .Morocco’s players raised the Palestinian flag on the pitch to celebrate defeating Canada and making it to the round of 16 and then again when they scored a historic victory against Spain to qualify for the quarter-finals. .Moroccan fans have also been seen celebrating at Doha’s iconic Souq Waqif, singing the famous Rajawi chant: .Our heart is sad for you .Our eyes have been tearing for you for years, .Oh beloved Palestine .Where are the Arabs, they are sleeping .Oh, the most beautiful of all countries, resist .May God protect you… .A number of matches have also seen Palestinian flags raised at the 48th minute, accompanied by pro-Palestinian chants, to remind the world of the Nakba (catastrophe) Palestinians experienced in 1948 when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were dispossessed and turned into refugees for life. .But it has not been just Arabs expressing their support for Palestine. .“Free Palestine, Free Palestine”, Brazil fans were heard chanting on the Doha metro, as they headed to their match against Cameroon. Fans from all over the world have been happy to accept and wave Palestinian flags given away by Palestinians in the streets of Doha. .Israeli media and citizens were allowed to attend the World Cup under FIFA requirements, although Israel and Qatar do not have formal diplomatic ties. The Israeli government probably thought the tournament was an incredible opportunity to demonstrate once again that it is able to overcome the decades-old Arab policy of not engaging with the Israeli colonial state. But it did not turn out that way. .Fans have overwhelmingly rejected Israeli media. Dozens of viral videos have circulated on social media showing Israelis trying to talk with fans and utterly failing. Lebanese, Saudi, Moroccan, Egyptian, Jordanian, Qatari, Yemeni, Tunisian, Palestinian, but also Japanese, Brazilian, Iranian, and other fans have been caught on camera adamantly refusing to engage. .“You are not welcome here”, a Saudi Arabia fan tells an Israeli journalist in one video. “Even though this is Qatar, it is still our country. There is no Israel, only Palestine.” . .In another video, a few England fans line up behind an Israeli reporter appearing ready to talk. He asks them “is it coming home?” “It is coming home,” they respond. “But more importantly Free Palesteeeeen!” one of them shouts into the microphone before they walk away. .Apparently, it got so bad for the Israeli media that some of its reporters started to pretend they were from other countries, like Portugal, Germany and Ecuador. Others continued to try. .“We have peace, huh? You signed peace, you signed on the peace agreement,” implored one Israeli journalist, desperately trying to convince Morocco fans to talk to him. As they walked away, they shouted: “Palestine, no Israel.” .Indeed, in 2020, Morocco, along with Bahrain, the UAE and Sudan, signed agreements to normalise diplomatic relations. That allowed Israelis to travel to the UAE – among others things – where they had a warm reception. This experience may have misled them to think they would be welcome in the region, but that is not the case. .The Israeli media has been busy talking about Israelis feeling like persona non grata in Qatar, being kicked out of restaurants and taxis as soon as they say they are from Israel. There seems to be a growing realisation in Israel that normalisation efforts may not be as successful as they may have thought. .Arabs have known it all along: normalisation and peace deals are only valid on paper with governments that do not represent the people. Their hearts remain with Palestine until Palestinians become free, which will only happen when the rest of the region is also free. .The survival of the Israeli apartheid state is essentially dependent on dictatorial anti-democratic regimes that turn a deaf ear to the voices of their people on all things freedom, including Palestine. . .The viral videos of Israeli misadventures in the World Cup seem to have receded. Israeli diplomats have reportedly expressed discontent with how Israeli citizens have been treated and called on FIFA and Qatar to ensure the safety and comfort of its journalists. .Complaints from the Israeli media have been received with mockery, with some pointing to the long list of Palestinian journalists Israel has abused, arrested and killed, including Al Jazeera’s reporter Shireen Abu Akleh. Her portrait could also be spotted at the tournament. .This strong Palestinian presence, growing day after day in the World Cup, has served as a reminder to the global community that the situation in Palestine is intolerable and cannot be ignored. As the World Cup proceeds, Palestinians are being killed, displaced, deported, intimidated and arrested with no solution on the horizon. A coalition of far-right parties has taken over the Israeli government, threatening to escalate apartheid violence against the Palestinians even more. .In the World Cup, the Palestinians have also seen an opportunity to strengthen their Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS). While Ukraine and its supporters have managed to get FIFA and UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) to suspend the Russian national team and football clubs from competing in their tournaments over Russian aggression, the Palestinian efforts to get the same treatment for Israel over its occupation of Palestinian land have so far failed. .Still, Palestinians and their allies have succeeded in making this boycott happen at FIFA’s biggest event in their own way: from the bottom up. While it remains to be seen how this powerful show of solidarity will translate into political action, this World Cup will definitely be remembered for a clear-cut historic victory: Palestine vs Israel 1-0 .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",173

Now that the tournament has passed its halfway mark, we can finally see it in practice. Morocco is now the last Arab and African team standing. After their win against Spain, players posed with the Palestinian flag, highlighting an issue that has become central to fans at the tournament. In this episode, we see how the World Cup Qatar 2022 has panned out so far, from upsets to football culture to geopolitics. .In this episode:  .Connect with us: .@AJEPodcasts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook .Full episode transcript: .This transcript was created using AI. It’s been reviewed by humans, but it might contain errors. Please let us know if you have any corrections or questions, our email is TheTake@aljazeera.net. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Sepp Blatter: The winner to organise the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. .Halla Mohieddeen: Ever since it was announced that the World Cup was heading to an Arab country, there have been a lot of questions about what the world’s biggest sporting event would look like in the Middle East. .Newsreel: One and a half million visitors are expected to attend the Middle East’s first World Cup. .Newsreel: A chance to construct a very different image of the Middle East to the world. .Halla Mohieddeen: Now that we’re halfway through the tournament, we can finally see what that looks like in practice. From upsets to footballing culture to geopolitics, today we’re looking at how the first World Cup in the Middle East has panned out so far. I’m Halla Mohieddeen and this is The Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Today I’m talking with Tony Karon. He’s the editorial lead at AJ+, and he’s been a fixture in our football coverage. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: It’s our first time speaking since the World Cup actually started. We had a good little chin wag before the World Cup about VAR. But even with or without the VAR, this has been an unpredictable tournament. Let’s start off with one of the biggest upsets I think fans will associate with this World Cup. .Newsreel: Argentina have been beaten 2-1 by Saudi Arabia in their opening game. .Newsreel: One of the biggest shocks in World Cup history without a shadow of a doubt. .Halla Mohieddeen: What went through your mind at that game? .Tony Karon: So at the end of the last World Cup, I wrote a piece for the New York Times about how the power balance in world football was in some ways mimicking what was happening in geopolitics. Foreign policy types use the term multipolarity, that a world order dominated by sort of a handful of industrialised nations was suddenly being challenged in geopolitics and power was being more distributed. .Halla Mohieddeen: So, say you were to pick out an equivalent of the G7 of the football world. .Tony Karon: Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, and Italy probably would’ve been your most powerful states. And you could see how that has been challenged. So what you were seeing then already, and seeing even more in this World Cup, is that you have countries outside of the traditional dominant football powers suddenly able to go toe-to-toe with traditional powers. So that upset, Argentina losing to Saudi Arabia was just this brilliant moment of going, actually, the global game is now far more open, far more competitive, frankly, than it’s ever been. There is no game, there is no result you can take for granted. .Halla Mohieddeen: And Tony says the atmosphere from his TV alone showed the almost home-game advantage Arab teams have been feeling since this tournament began. .Tony Karon: You have the same thing that we know from Africa, where if our own country’s team is not the one playing or the one winning, we support other teams from Africa because we want Africa to do well on the international stage. And I think you’re seeing the same thing, that in Doha, fans from all over the region celebrate a Saudi victory, celebrate a Morocco victory. I think it was two nights later in New York, I got a cab ride with a driver from Bangladesh and the first thing he said was just how proud he was of Saudi Arabia beating Argentina. So you can see how that resonated with a far wider community that haven’t been traditionally big players on the global football stage. .Halla Mohieddeen: It’s a sentence that I wouldn’t have thought I’d hear just a matter of weeks ago, I’m so proud of Saudi Arabia. I mean, there were so many videos of Saudi fans celebrating after their win and, you know, just so many people celebrating, not just Saudis. I mean, what did you make of those? .Tony Karon: I’ve been a lifelong Liverpool fan. The owners of Liverpool FC right now are a Boston-based hedge fund. That’s not who the fans are celebrating when the team wins. They feel the sense of ownership over the team. And I think with national teams, it’s actually similar. It’s like regardless of where people are on the political or geopolitical spectrum, they feel a sense of ownership and being represented by the team regardless of the politics. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that celebration was even more evident in Doha. .Newsreel: Everybody’s saying here, it’s such a massive day for Arab football. Everybody’s pleased to be here. People from Morocco, people from Tunisia, Iraq, all coming down to celebrate that shock win from Saudi Arabia. .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: Okay, so I’d like to preempt everything by saying that my voice is a bit scratchy, and that is because of the World Cup itself. .Halla Mohieddeen: That’s Abubakr Al-Shamahi, Al Jazeera’s Middle East and North Africa editor. And, like most people, he was stunned by the Saudi victory. .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: That game was not supposed to be a Saudi Arabia win. It was clearly supposed to be an Argentina win. And where I’m living right now, I live very close to the stadium where the match happened, at Lusail Stadium. And as soon as that second goal went in, I just thought, I need to go and see the fans. .[SOUND OF CELEBRATIONS] .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: And I think it was – what? – the third day of the World Cup or something along those lines. It was like the moment I feel, really, that the World Cup woke up. And it was because we had this amazing atmosphere, this amazing result, and this opportunity for a team from the region to really make history. .Halla Mohieddeen: The nature of the upset was surprising. You have Argentina, led by the legendary Lionel Messi, a potential favourite to win the whole tournament. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: And then you have Saudi Arabia. .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: I’m not Saudi myself, but I’m originally Yemeni, I’m Arab. And I remember growing up, Saudi Arabia would perform so badly every World Cup. And I would get the taunts at school because I was Arab, even though I had no relation to the Saudi team whatsoever and didn’t support them. Going from almost like the butt of jokes at the World Cup, losing eight nil to Germany in the past as well. I remember that result, and then you’ve got Argentina and you’re expecting something similar might be happening and instead they turn around and actually win. It’s crazy. .Halla Mohieddeen: So the Saudi win was just that, one win. But it also gave the world some insight into Saudi footballing culture. Saudi’s league has some intense fans, many of whom went to Qatar to watch the national team play. .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: There’s a term that’s obviously been adopted in Arabic, which is “ultras”. This is something that comes from Europe, of like, overly passionate fans almost, who, their team becomes an integral part of their identity, and they make that clear through songs and chants and music and banners. They call these huge banners, tifos that they unfurl in the stadium that has been adopted by the Saudis as it has been in other Arab countries as well, such as Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia. .Halla Mohieddeen: These elements, familiar to football fans anywhere, then get their own local Saudi spin. .[CHANTING SOUNDS] .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: I was talking to fans, and they were talking to me about how they were able to introduce Saudi tribal chants into their footballing chant. And the style of chanting was actually based on Saudi and Arab culture, they’ve kind of intermingled with things that have come from the outside and formed this Saudi footballing culture. Many people from outside of Saudi Arabia, including in the Arab world, and I have to say, even myself, I did not really see the full extent of Saudi fan culture, until I witnessed the presence of those fans at the World Cup itself. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s partly because any foreign media coverage of Saudi usually centres more on its government than its people. .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: There’s obviously a perception of Saudi Arabia, and you know, there’s one thing to talk about politics and governments, but it’s another thing to talk about people, and the actual Saudi people themselves. And Saudi people can be stereotyped, not just in the wider world, but also in the Arab region itself. And I saw it when I was speaking to people, once I started telling them, just from my perspective how cool it was to see all that, I could see the pride in their faces. They were very happy to talk about that because it was an opportunity to actually talk about something positive. .Halla Mohieddeen: So, unfortunately, the Saudi dream ended shortly after that match, when they lost to Poland and Mexico. But they weren’t the only Arab team that pulled an upset. .Newsreel: Morocco beat Belgium two-nil with what was clearly a fully deserved win. .Newsreel: Now another shock result from this World Cup as Tunisia was able to clinch a one-nil win over defending champions of France. .Newsreel: Absolute brilliance for Morocco. They go on to win the group, 2-1 final today against Canada. .Halla Mohieddeen: Despite the wins from Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, Morocco was the only Arab team to advance to the Round of 16. They played that match on Tuesday against Spain. Neither team scored a goal, even in extra time, but Morocco took down the former world champions in penalty kicks. .[CHEERING SOUNDS] .Halla Mohieddeen: Fans inside and outside the stadium went wild. Newsreel: Wow, what a penalty shootout. You would not believe it. Morocco through, Spain out. Halla Mohieddeen: Morocco will go to the quarterfinals of the World Cup for the first time, and the sound of their celebrations resounded across Doha. I asked Tony about how the fan presence might help the teams they support. [MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: We have seen some pretty impressive performances from North African and Asian teams. I think of Japan in particular, who have now managed to send Germany packing. Do you think that having the World Cup located outside of Europe and Latin America has actually helped these other teams in some way? .Tony Karon: I think being in Qatar where the host country is far more accessible to fans from Africa and Asia will have made a difference, not only in terms of air travel, but also visa accessibility. If you’re from Africa and you’re trying to get a visa to Europe for any reason, and you have an African passport, it is a nightmare. I used to have a South African passport. I’ve actually experienced this directly where you take a pile of documents, bank statements from the last six months, a floor plan of the place that you’re going to be staying, which has been approved by some municipal authority in France. ⁹It’s absolutely ridiculous. Fortress Europe. So, you know, you can think, well, fans can travel to Qatar far more easily and they have done so. I think there’s definitely an element, certainly for teams from the region, I found like very much a home crowd, and that, you know, playing at home helps, of course. .Halla Mohieddeen: After the break, a look at the issues this home crowd is raising in front of the rest of the world. .Halla Mohieddeen: Today I’m speaking with Tony Karon about how the first World Cup in the Middle East is playing out so far. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: But first, another dispatch from Doha, from Al Jazeera’s Abubakr Al-Shamahi. .Abubakr Al-Shamahi: This has been an opportunity for people from around the region to gather in one place. I have to say that is a rare thing to happen for people from Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, all these different countries. There’s very often not really this existence of a shared space, where they can actually express themselves. What we’re seeing in Qatar right now with the World Cup is this kind of opportunity for people from all these different countries to actually mix, intermingle, speak to each other, in a way that really for many of them only existed online or through television, and the reality is for many Arabs, Palestine is number one, or if not, number one, one of the most important issues for them. .Halla Mohieddeen: Some of the most viral moments of the World Cup have come from tournament attendees, either refusing to speak with Israeli media, or using an appearance as a way to express their support for the Palestinian cause. And it’s not just Arab fans. Some England supporters, when asked by Israeli media about whether the World Cup is “coming home” to England… .Newsreel: First question. Is it coming home? Of course it is, It’s coming home. .Halla Mohieddeen: Qualified their response… .Newsreel: But more importantly, free Palestine. .Halla Mohieddeen: This broad support is something Tony was keen to mention as well. .Tony Karon: It’s been absolutely remarkable that the Palestinian flag is the most recurring symbol other than the flags of the countries who are participating. And I think we’ve seen that, you know, whenever Morocco plays, when Tunisia plays, you’ve seen so many fans on the streets and in the stands flying that flag. It is a really interesting moment that actually raises a lot of questions. .Halla Mohieddeen: One is about FIFA’s treatment of Palestine. .Tony Karon: You know, it’s been put on FIFA’s agenda since 2014 that not only is Israel violating international law simply by the fact of the occupation, but it’s actually violating a number of very specific FIFA statutes – FIFA recognises Palestine as its own entity. And so the fact that Israel has settlement teams in its domestic leagues is a flagrant violation of FIFA’s extraterritoriality rules that, when Russia tried to bring Crimean teams into its league, it was warned that it would lose the 2018 World Cup if it did that. .Halla Mohieddeen: But another question this solidarity raises is about the state of the occupation, especially as Palestinians have been killed by Israel during the World Cup. .Newsreel: Two brothers have become the latest casualties of near-daily confrontations between Palestinians and Israel’s military .Newsreel: 2022 already counts as the bloodiest year in the occupied West Bank since 2006, a year that isn’t over yet. .Tony Karon: Not only FIFA, but also some of the governments of the Arab countries themselves, have actually chosen to normalise ties with Israel, regardless of what’s happening with the Palestinians. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Tony’s talking here about the wave of agreements several Arab governments have signed with Israel, restoring relations after decades of official boycotts. .Newsreel: The deal between Israel and the UAE is called the Abraham Accords. It’s been brokered by the United States. .Newsreel: First Israel and the United Arab Emirates, now Israel and Bahrain announcing they would normalise arrangements and agreements. .Newsreel: Morocco and Israel have normalised ties in a US broker deal. .Tony Karon: What you’re seeing here is a situation where the Arab public having a rare opportunity to make their voices heard in some cases, is expressing dissent, is saying no, we can’t accept this. We cannot normalise relations with this apartheid entity that’s actually killing people. So I think, you know, it’s a dissent over Palestine and an expression of solidarity with a people suffering under occupation. But I think it’s also an identity statement of people from a region, which broke out in open rebellion in 2011, in search of a different way of being governed. And that has largely been closed down. And to me, what we’re seeing here is a sense that the Palestinian flag doesn’t only mean Palestine, it also means, in a lot of Arab societies, people challenging the way they’re governed and looking for something different. .Halla Mohieddeen: Someone had said on Twitter that it’s telling that as soon as this free forum emerges, it’s immediately filmed with explicit expression of solidarity for the Palestinians and football. The World Cup is a rare moment of open space and assembly in the Arab region. Does that kind of tally with what you know? .Tony Karon: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think football represents a fairly unique, and perhaps I’m biased here because, you know, this is what I spend my time obsessing about, but I think it’s a very unique form of civil society. And as you say, it creates a public space for expression that a lot of authoritarian regimes don’t allow, typically. And you’ve seen people move into that with gusto at the World Cup, with an absolute sense of like, here’s something you are looking to sweep under the carpet, but we’re not. Also, just another, should we say, ‘scientific observation’ about football. And that is like, what is the value, at least the monetary value of football as a spectacle? Where does FIFA make money? From selling the TV rights to the World Cup. Same for the Premiership, same for the European Champions League. So what is the spectacle that’s being sold? Is it just the game itself? Well, look what happened during COVID when you were playing games behind closed doors. They are dull as doornails. It’s like watching a training session. .Halla Mohieddeen: They were having to pump atmosphere! .Tony Karon: Exactly. The fake sounds, right! Exactly. .Halla Mohieddeen: Fake sounds of clapping and cheering. .Tony Karon: Exactly. And that tells you that actually the spectacle, the valuable spectacle of football is the chemistry of the interaction between what’s happening on the field and the fans. And that gives the fans a lot of power. .[SOUNDS OF DANCE-OFF PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: And fan spectacle has been something to behold at this tournament. Whether that’s Arab and Brazilian supporters having a dance-off outside the stadium … .[SOUNDS OF METRO, THIS WAY CHANTS] .Halla Mohieddeen: … or match attendees turning a World Cup employee into an internet sensation for giving directions to the metro with a dose of charisma. This World Cup has offered us some genuine moments of connection. .Tony Karon: I think a World Cup always offers this moment of a global community that, like, for all of the tensions, stresses, schisms, and often very violent differences that play out in the world, the World Cup is this moment of shared humanity. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: It’s like acknowledging that there are things we have in common, and that creates a basis for thinking about a different kind of human community. Now that, you know, that sounds naive. It sounds a little kitschy. I think it’s true. It doesn’t mean that that is the outcome, but it reminds us of the possibility of better outcomes. The legacy for me when a fan from Tunisia is encountering a fan from Argentina, or Ecuador, or from Senegal. You know, you think what is holding us together? We all love football, but also we have a world to save and a world to win? Dare I sound like some old lefty? At the end of the day, the people of the world own the World Cup and at the end of the day, the people of the world are gonna have to own their destiny, our destiny. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s The Take. This episode was produced by Negin Owliaei with Chloe K Li, Ruby Zaman, Alexandra Locke, Ashish Malhotra, Amy Walters, and me, Halla Mohieddeen. Alex Roldan is our sound designer. Aya Elmileik and Adam Abou-Gad are The Take’s engagement producers. Ney Alvarez is Al Jazeera’s head of audio. We’ll be back on Friday.",174
175,Published On 7 Dec 2022,Samuel Eto’o apologises for attacking a man after World Cup match,Cameroon Football Federation President was filmed having an altercation with a man outside Stadium 974.,".Cameroon Football Federation President Samuel Eto’o who was also a former striker has apologised for a “violent altercation” after attacking a man outside the World Cup stadium following Brazil’s 4-1 victory over South Korea earlier this week. .On Monday, fans were taking selfies with Eto’o outside Stadium 974 in Doha when he was approached by a man who was filming him and made some comments that angered Eto’o, as seen in videos that went viral on social media. .At first, the former footballer was held back by his entourage, but he broke free and appeared to kick the man in the face, who fell to the ground. The man was able to stand up and did not appear seriously injured. .“I had a violent altercation with a person who was probably an Algerian supporter, I would like to apologise for losing my temper and reacting in a way that does not match my personality,” Eto’o said in released statements in French and English on his Twitter account on Wednesday. .He also said that he has been “the target of insults and allegations of cheating without any evidence” after a controversial Cameroon-Algeria match in March. .“I pledge to continue to resist the relentless provocation and daily harassment of some Algerian supporters.” . .Eto’o, who is also a Qatar 2022 World Cup ambassador, called on Algerian authorities and its football federation “to put end to this unhealthy climate before a more serious tragedy occurs”. .On Monday, Algerian YouTuber Said Mamouni published a video wearing the same clothes as in the first video and said that he has been the victim of the attack. .Mamouni showed a broken camera and said that Eto’o had hit him in the chest, chin and jaw. He added that he was at a police station in Doha to file a report against Eto’o. .“Samuel had a fight with me. He hit me, and the one accompanying him pushed me. I’m here to lodge a complaint and he also smashed my camera,” Mamouni said, claiming that his comment about the March game angered Eto’o. .He said he had asked Eto’o if he had bribed Gambian referee Bakary Papa Gassama, who oversaw the match between both teams in the African Cup of Nations.",175
176,Published On 7 Dec 2022,Morocco wakes up to a World Cup dream that came true,Morocco beat Spain to reach the World Cup 2022 quarter-finals. Fans back in the country could barely believe what they saw.,".As the sun rose above Morocco on Wednesday morning, the thrill and ecstasy from the night before had barely settled. .It is just hours after the Moroccan football team had created history – a place in the quarter-finals of the World Cup after beating Spain on Tuesday evening in Doha. .It was an unprecedented feat for a side that not many picked to be in the last eight. .In Doha, the fans sang, danced and celebrated into the early morning. And it was a feeling not lost on Moroccans back home. .“What a great day to be a Moroccan,” Abdessamad told Al Jazeera in Marrakesh. “My heart sank every time we failed to score from an opportunity. As Spain missed their penalties, I forgot everything around me. Suddenly, the loud roar around me made me realise we made it to the quarter-finals. .“Our team is on the road to something more magical, something bigger, something insane.” .In the capital, Rabat, cafes were lined up with people eager to watch the match, roads were packed and squares where screenings were taking place were filled with flags and Moroccans wearing team jerseys. A feeling of hope and optimism prevailed. .The win gave them an excuse to celebrate all night. .“It’s the first time I had this feeling,” Fahd Belbachir was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. “We’re so proud.” .It was a day where history was made and Moroccans on the streets the morning after said they could not be more proud of what the team had achieved. .Some were even in disbelief, not fully able to comprehend that the dream was in fact reality. .“We are so proud of our Lions, who fought hard to get us into the quarter-finals,” Niama Meddoun, a Rabat resident, said. “We are delighted to be Moroccans today, since we are the first Arab country that has reached the quarter-finals.” .Videos circulating online showed the King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, out celebrating with a Moroccan flag. .He praised the national team “who gave their all and blazed a trail throughout this great sporting event”. He added that the players represented the “hopes and dreams of Moroccans in Morocco, Qatar, and all over the world”. .With only eight out of the 32 teams left, Morocco is the only Arab and African nation in the tournament at this stage at the first World Cup being held in the Middle East. .Morocco’s success at the tournament has reverberated across the Arab world and among Moroccan and some other immigrant communities in Europe. .Ceuta is a Spanish exclave which borders Morocco on the North African coast. Its population is a mix of Spaniards and Moroccan residents and workers. The Associated Press reported that the win was also celebrated with cars honking horns there. .“What pride, what happiness, now to celebrate with friends. I have lost my voice,” said 20-year-old Ismael Mustafa. “We were able to pull it off. For Spain? You will win next time, so no worries.” .TV channels in Morocco dedicated the news bulletins to pan to various celebrations taking place across all cities and regions in Morocco. .The common denominator in all: euphoric supporters enjoying the joyous occasion. “Spain is gone, who is next” was a common phrase shouted across the country. .“The national team doesn’t only represent Moroccans, it represent Arabs and Africans from all over the world,” one fan told Al Jazeera in Marrakesh. “Football has united all these nations under the Moroccan flag.” .Reporting by Khadija Satou in Marrakech and Faras Ghani in Doha",176
177,Published On 7 Dec 2022,Morocco’s Hakimi: From ‘difficult moments’ to World Cup stardom,"Born in Spain, Hakimi from a very young age was touted as a star prospect. He delivered at Qatar World Cup on Tuesday.",".Fortune favours the brave. Just ask Achraf Hakimi. .After Morocco and Spain punched through 120 minutes of no goals in the World Cup 2022 round of 16 match, the Paris Saint-Germain right-back was called upon to take a penalty kick, a kick that could rewrite Morocco’s footballing history. .With the nerves of an entire nation – and neutral fans – on edge, Hakimi stepped up, leaned left, wrongfooted Spain goal-keeper Unai Simon, and dispatched a perfectly executed Panenka. .It was a legendary chip shot that elevated an already stellar international career into permanent Moroccan footballing lore. .For the Madrid-born Hakimi, the road to the top has been a long, winding and bumpy one. .He was touted as a star prospect from a very young age and was scouted by Real Madrid. But even though Hakimi joined Europe’s most successful club at the age of eight, he had to scratch and claw for every bit of success that came his way. . .Like 800,000 others, Hakimi is part of the significant Moroccan diaspora in Spain. He grew up in a lower-income household in Madrid’s industrial suburb of Getafe. The daily commute to Real Madrid’s Castilla academy exposed him to much higher standards of living, yet he still describes his childhood as “happy” with some “difficult moments”. .“My mother was a cleaning lady and my father was a street vendor,” he said on the Spanish TV programme, El Chiringuito. “They gave up their lives for me. They took many things away from my siblings in order for me to succeed. Today, I play for them.” .It was around this time that a teenaged Hakimi began putting together scintillating performances in the UEFA Youth League that catapulted him into local notoriety. .It was also around this time that he caught the eye of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation. .Because the Moroccan diaspora across Europe is so big, there is talent littered across Spain, Belgium, France and the Netherlands that the Federation works with scouts to detect and convince to play for Morocco. .“We scouted Achraf Hakimi when he was playing with Real Madrid’s U17 team.” Nasser Larguet, then the Federation technical director, told FourFourTwo magazine in 2018. .“He was constantly in touch with our scouts, asking when our next training camp or match was. I, personally, made him the promise that if he continued to work as he had, he would soon join the senior national team.” .Sure enough, Hakimi would make his national debut in 2016 at the age of 18, citing sentimental reasons for the decision. Although he flirted with the idea of playing for Spain and made a handful of appearances for the Spanish youth team, Hakimi ultimately never felt like he fit with La Roja. .“My culture is Moroccan. At home, we spoke and ate Moroccan and I am a practising Muslim. Honestly, I didn’t have to think about it so much,” he said in an interview with L’Equipe magazine. “I used to watch Morocco matches with my father who always told me about the legendary players of the past.” .In 2017, as he was ready to break into senior football, Real Madrid were in the midst of a historic run in the UEFA Champions League that would see them win three consecutive continental titles. .Under the tutelage of Zinedine Zidane, he made nine La Liga appearances and scored two goals, and that was enough for him to secure a national team spot at the 2018 World Cup. .The tournament in Russia was a frustrating experience for Hakimi and the Atlas Lions. Despite outplaying Spain, Portugal and Iran, the side was eliminated in the group stages. .With a World Cup under his belt, Hakimi was ready to take a big leap in his career and cement a starting role at Real Madrid. .Disappointingly, the club sent him out on a two-year loan to Borussia Dortmund. Motivated to prove that he was good enough, Hakimi took the Bundesliga by storm, scoring 12 goals and delivering 17 assists in 73 matches across two seasons. .Real Madrid still refused to call on his services. .The constant rejection spurred him on in Italy with Inter Milan, the club he joined in 2020 and where he was an integral part of the Antonio Conté side that brought a scudetto back to the blue and black side of the city for the first time in over a decade. .Finally, in 2021, after a long trek through adversity, Hakimi was finally recognised for his talent when he made a blockbuster move to French champions PSG in a move worth approximately $83m. .It may sound peculiar to say that a 24-year-old is a veritable leader of a national team, yet Hakimi’s regularly excellent play has been one of the few constants Morocco supporters could hold on to over the past three years. .When players like Hakim Ziyech and Noussair Mazraoui clashed with former managers, Hakimi’s behaviour was always unanimously beyond reproach. Former Morocco manager Vahid Halilhodzic, who is from Bosnia, even used him as a measuring stick for possible prospects during a routine press conference. .“Hakimi’s body fat percentage is 7 percent, while other Moroccan players who play in the domestic league have a fat mass that varies between 13 and 16 percent,” Halilhodzic said. .As the North Africans struggled to score goals at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, it was Hakimi – a defender – who stepped up and compensated, multiplying his lung-bursting runs down the flank and scoring two crucial goals. .His unfailing ability to step up when the team needs him has become the norm for the Moroccan faithful. That is why no one was surprised to see him take the crucial penalty kick against Spain on Tuesday evening. .And that is why he’ll be relied on, once more, to elevate his game and help take Morocco to a World Cup semi-final.",177
178,Published On 7 Dec 2022,Ronaldo’s World Cup: Sidelined then eclipsed by stand-in Ramos,Portugal manager Fernando Santos said Ronaldo’s place in the remainder of the World Cup still had to be ‘defined’.,".The world of football punditry was ablaze with speculation and opinion after Portugal’s superstar striker Cristiano Ronaldo – wearing a substitute’s bib – sat out most of the Portugal vs Switzerland World Cup game that saw the Portuguese side stride into the quarter-finals with a 6-1 win. .Adding fuel to the fire on Tuesday, Portugal’s manager Fernando Santos said Ronaldo’s role for the remainder of the World Cup tournament is still to be “defined”. .When asked directly if Ronaldo would play against Morocco in the quarter-final showdown on December 10, Santos replied bullishly: “Ronaldo will definitely (be involved), all the players on the bench can be used, if they are not in the starting lineup, they can play later. .“It is important to look at the example of this player’s history, he is one of the best players in the world at playing professionally, being captain – all we have to do is think about this team collectively,” he said. .But, earlier, Ronaldo cut a solitary figure as he walked off the field following the match against the Swiss in which he was far from the centre of attention. .Chants of “Ronaldo! Ronaldo!” had swept around the 89,000-seat Lusail Stadium – the biggest stadium at the World Cup – and then loud jeers when the fans realised their idol wasn’t starting for the team. .Ronaldo had come off the bench very late in a game that moved Portugal into the quarter-finals and saw his 21-year-old replacement, Goncalo Ramos, score a hat-trick in his first full debut for Portugal’s national team. It was also the first hat trick of the World Cup tournament. .Ronaldo, 37, congratulated Ramos at midfield at the end of the match, then walked towards the Portugal section of fans and briefly clapped in their direction. But, as the rest of his squad had their moment of fan appreciation, Ronaldo left his teammates behind and walked off alone through the tunnel – perhaps wondering where his career goes from here. .He is currently without a club after leaving Manchester United midway through the World Cup, and he does not appear to be assured a place in the forthcoming quarter-final. .Ronaldo breezed through the post-match interview area with a huge grin on his face, only responding to one question: Was he happy? .“Of course, of course,” the superstar grinned. “Portugal won.” .But it’s not all smiles inside the Portugal camp. .As a writer for an Indian sports magazine asked: “Can one man’s absence make a team better? The answer might not be the one that Cristiano Ronaldo fans want to hear.” . .Portugal’s manager Santos had expressed frustration with Ronaldo the day before he was benched for the Switzerland game. .Santos said the decision was tactical and not disciplinary, but he had acknowledged on Monday that he was bothered by Ronaldo’s poor attitude after he pulled him late in a 2-1 loss to South Korea in the final of the group games. .“I think those issues have been solved. I said that in my last press conference and I repeat myself: This is something which is finished, solved,” Santos said. .“I have a very close relationship [with Ronaldo]. I have known him since he was 19 years old in Sporting,” he said. .“I think Ronaldo and I never misinterpret the human and personal aspect with that of manager and player, and what we need to do during the match,” he added. .“That is what we will do. I will always consider he is a very important player to have in the team.” .Dropping Ronaldo from the lineup on Tuesday, Santos started Ramos, a little-known forward who made his international debut just three weeks ago. .But what a start it was: Ramos scored on just his fourth touch of the game in the 17th minute to give Portugal a 1-0 lead. He then added goals in the 51st and again in the 67th minute. .“Not even in my wildest dreams did I think about being part of the starting team for the knockout stage,” Ramos said through a translator after being named player of the match. .Those three goals instantly made Ramos one of international football’s hottest prospects though many may not have even known his name before Tuesday. .Standing in for Ronaldo has changed everything. . .“Most people in the world had never heard about him until today,” Portugal midfielder Bruno Fernandes said of Ramos after the match. .Fernandes was also the only member of the Portugal squad to indicate that Ronaldo was displeased at being benched. He also seemed prepared for the controversy surrounding Ronaldo and stood firm in defending him as a Portugal team representative tried multiple times to pull him away from reporters. .“We won the first two games with Cristiano in the first 11, and it could be that if Cristiano played, he could score three goals and no one would be speaking about Cristiano being on the bench,” Fernandes said. .“I don’t think people should be talking about Cristiano and why he’s not playing, because when Cristiano plays and the team wins, no one talks about that,” he said. .“When Cristiano plays and the team loses, everyone talks.” .Fernandes called Ronaldo “the most famous player in the world. No one is more famous than Cristiano in sports, not in football, in sports.” .When asked about Ramos’s reaction to getting the start, he defensively turned the question towards Ronaldo. .“Do you think anyone likes to be on the bench?” Fernando said. “I don’t think Cristiano would be happy. If the manager put me on the bench in the next game, I would be angry.” .Asked if Ronaldo spoke to him before the game, Ramos said the issue of being benched did not come up among the players. .“Honestly, in our team, no one talked about it. Cristiano as our captain, as he always did, he helped us, he gave encouragement to us, not only to myself but our team-mates.” .Now with the crucial quarter-final match against Morocco on Saturday, Santos may have to decide whether to stick with Ramos or restore Ronaldo – the top scorer in men’s international football and one of the game’s greatest-ever football players. .Santos’s choice will be watched closely for more signs of one star rising and another fading.",178

The Atlas Lions’s Spanish-born superstar wing back had the chance to send Morocco through to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time ever. .So when, following the nerve-racking penalty shootout against Spain, Hakimi ever-so-easily kicked the ball into the net at Education City Stadium in Qatar, thousands of spectators collectively heaved a huge sigh of relief – and then they roared. .Safa, 39, said she “didn’t expect” Morocco to make it this far. .“We are so glad … the next game we will win 1-0 inshallah,” the Casablanca resident told Al Jazeera. .Safa, who was also at Morocco’s game against Canada on December 1, said the hype from the fans inside the stadium probably also had a “positive impact” on the players. . .A cacophony of cheering, singing and drumming overtook the stadium as soon as the historic match began. .Reaching the quarter-finals was an unspeakable feat, adding to the successes of Arab teams Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, which beat Argentina and France, respectively, despite their eventual exit from the World Cup. .The wave of support in the stadium was deafening as Morocco became the first Arab nation and fourth African country to advance to the last eight of football’s greatest tournament. .“It is a dream come true, I have no words to express my happiness,” Fadoua Chernane told Al Jazeera. .“They are our heroes, they made us proud today, no matter if we win the World Cup or not, we have made history today,” the 42-year-old said. .As the celebrations quickly spread across Doha, Arab fans took to Twitter to share pictures of Hakimi hugging and kissing his mother, who had been cheering him on from the bleachers. . .Hakimi’s personal story became a source of inspiration for some. .  .Meanwhile, the picture of the winning team unfurling a Palestinian flag during their on-pitch celebrations went viral. . .Morocco’s players had also held up the flag – which has featured several times through the tournament – after their win against Canada last week. .Some pointed out that the presence of the Palestinian flag and the choruses to “Free Palestine” at the tournament proved that Arabs – unlike their rulers – remained supportive of the Palestinian cause. . .An ESPN reporter noted that “Every North African and Middle East team has made sure that the Palestine issue is prominent at every game”. . .Moroccans celebrating their team’s historic World Cup victory were joined by people across the Middle East and North Africa in what was seen as a win for the entire Arab world. . .In Morocco’s capital Rabat, where fans had crowded into cafes hours before to watch the game, people jammed downtown roads leading to a square where supporters had celebrated after previous Moroccan victories, flags waving from their windows and horns furiously honking. .“It’s the first time I had this feeling!” said Fahd Belbachir, on his way to the city centre. “We’re so proud.” .Brahim Ait Belkhit said the spontaneous mood of joy was so great he had patched up a feud with somebody he had avoided for years and then saw in the street. .“It made us forget our old quarrel,” he said. .Leaders from across the Arab world showered praise on the Moroccan side. .“Congratulations to the Atlas Lions, you delighted us. Wow Morocco, you did it again!,” Queen Rania of Jordan wrote on Twitter. . .Cheers resounded from Tunis and Beirut to Baghdad, Ramallah and other cities as Arabs came together to rejoice at the largely unexpected win over Spain – a contrast to the political disputes that have long divided Arab states.",180
181,Published On 6 Dec 2022,Recap: Portugal vs Switzerland – World Cup 2022,Portugal did not miss the benched Cristiano Ronaldo as they blasted past a Swiss team stuck in neutral.,".Portugal’s Goncalo Ramos scored three goals as his team thrashed Switzerland 6-1 to set up a quarter-final against Morocco in the 2022 Qatar World Cup. .Ramos, on the pitch in place of the benched Cristiano Ronaldo, delivered a hat-trick for the ages on Wednesday night at Lusail Stadium as the old-timers of Portuguese football handed the baton to a younger generation. .Veteran Pepe, wearing the captain’s armband in Ronaldo’s absence, added to Ramos’s opener in the first half. .Ramos scored his second goal early in the second half. Raphael Guerreiro added a fourth before the hour mark as Portugal started scoring for fun. Then came the third for Ramos, with the 21-year-old becoming the first player to score a hat-trick in the knock-out stages of World Cup since 1990. .There was a balance to this Portugal team without the overbearing presence of their talismanic captain, who was dropped after he reacted angrily to being substituted against South Korea in the group stages. .Football is a team game and Portugal’s team all stepped up to fill the Ronaldo-sized void. .It was not head coach Fernando Santos’s only big call. He also left Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo out of the starting lineup. .Twenty-one-year-old Ramos was two years old when Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal. He had played fewer than 35 minutes of international football before tonight, making his debut last month. He had never started for his country before. The pressure was on. And he did not disappoint. .Portugal played like a team – interdependent, connected. For the first time this tournament, they looked like they could win it. .Switzerland’s Manuel Akanji turned the ball in at the far post from a beautifully weighted cross for a consolation goal in the 56th minute but it could not herald a turn in the tide of the game. .Joao Felix made way for Ronaldo to a huge ovation in the 72nd minute, winning his 195th cap for Portugal after fans chanted his name in this 90,000-seater stadium for a quarter of an hour. A spectacular effort from the veteran striker in the 82nd minute was ruled as offside. .Rafael Leao, 23, scored with a wonderful finish in the 91st minute to leave Portugal facing Morocco in the quarter-finals on Saturday afternoon, before England take on France. .But the question marks over Ronaldo’s future remain. Without a club, after a spectacular media implosion ended his time at Manchester United, and now with a natural replacement lined up in the national team, Ronaldo cut a lonely figure at the end of the match. .As the Portuguese team applauded their fans behind the goal, Ronaldo wandered off towards the tunnel alone.",181

This is one of the greatest moments in my life,” 27-year-old Amal Galidi told Al Jazeera. The Fez resident said both “Arabs and  Africans” will be the “happiest people today”. “God has listened to our prayers,” he proclaimed. . .Outside the stadium, hundreds gathered to sing football and national chants, posing gleefully for the cameras and in no mood to leave. The match felt like a home game for the Atlas Lions, with their supporters overwhelmingly outnumbering the Spanish fans. .Anass Boumlek, 26, from Marrakech, said he was “very, very happy”, adding that the victory “belongs to everyone” involved. .“The fans in the stands, the coaches, the players and all the staff, this belongs to everyone,” he said. “We are giving this win to everyone … all the Arabs, Africans and all the other nationalities that supported us.” .Boumlek, who lives in Doha, said that there will be a “party atmosphere” in Morocco and Qatar.",182

As Hakimi got hold of the ball, Morocco had the upper hand with the penalties despite the Spanish crowd trying its best to distract the penalty-takers from behind the goal with camera flashes. .Morocco had scored two. Spain had missed two. If Hakimi put this one in the back of the net, Morocco were through to their first World Cup quarter-final. .The crowd was up on its feet, some standing on the seats. Nobody was sitting except in the press box and VIP area. .Moroccan substitutes gathered the flags that the crowd has thrown to them. Celebrations were reaching a boiling point. It could happen at any moment. The nine by the centre circle pulled each other closer. Their grip was tight. Their hearts were beating faster. .The finish line was in sight, the victory was theirs. .Hakimi marked his run-up. If he scored, his country of birth was out of the World Cup. .He scored. .The sea of red erupted and Morocco stepped into unchartered territory. They are in a World Cup quarter-final for the first time after six attempts. .“It’s all the happiness of the world combined in this result. We’re all so, so, so happy,” a group of Moroccan fans at Education City Stadium shouted at the top of their lungs after the match ended. .“We were always confident of a win. Because we’re from Morocco. We’re lions,” Iman, originally from Casablanca but living in Qatar, said, referring to the team’s nickname Atlas Lions. . .The celebrations moved onto the foyer, then the stairs and then finally onto the outer perimeters of the stadium. But the Moroccan crowd was not done yet. Honking cars, waving flags, singing and shouting, relieved but rapturous, brimming with sheer ecstasy and in a frenzy, they danced on. .“I’m so, so proud to be Moroccan right now, wow, wow, wow. It’s amazing, it’s the best feeling in the world right now,” Khadija said. “I can’t wait for the next match. We’re staying in Qatar. We’re not going home.” .Spotted in the sea of Moroccan supporters were some Spain fans who were quietly making their way out of the stadium. .“Espana, Espana, this is the way to the airport, Espana,” taunted a group of Moroccan fans before hugging their Spanish counterparts. .For Firdous, she has a flight back to Morocco on Thursday morning. But she said she will be back for the quarter-final on Saturday. .“This is huge, it’s massive,” said Firdous. “This is an accomplishment that Morocco has never achieved. We’ve been waiting for this our entire lives. This is just the beginning. We’re going all the way. .“This morning, I knew we have something special in store for us today. And this is it. I’ve watched all of Morocco’s matches in the World Cup. Tomorrow, I’m going back to Morocco but I’ll come back for the next match. This is a sacrifice I’m willing to make for the team.” .Mohammad Karam, who could barely talk after enjoying the “match of his life”, could not believe what had transpired on the field. .“I still can’t believe it. I’m dreaming. It was a lot of nerves, a lot of tension, a lot of emotions. But we did it. We’re in the quarter-finals.”",183
184,Published On 6 Dec 2022,Ronaldo dropped from Portugal starting line-up against Swiss,Portugal manager Santos benches the captain after he reacted angrily to being substituted against South Korea.,".Doha, Qatar – Portugal manager Fernando Santos has dropped captain Cristiano Ronaldo from the starting line-up after the five-time Ballon d’Or winner reacted angrily to being substituted against South Korea. .There were growing calls for the 37-year-old superstar to be dropped for the final-16 match on Tuesday against Switzerland at Lusail Stadium. .The former Real Madrid and Manchester United forward appeared angry on Friday after he was taken off 25 minutes from the end of Portugal’s match, which they lost 2-1. .Santos made his feelings clear about his striker’s reaction during the pre-match press conference on Monday. .“I didn’t like it, not at all. I really did not like it,” Santos told reporters. .“But from that moment onwards, everything is finished, full stop, regarding that issue,” Santos said. “Now, we have to think about tomorrow’s match, and everyone is focused on tomorrow’s match.” .Ronaldo has said his angry reaction was aimed at a South Korean player rather than his manager for substituting him. .The Portuguese striker said the opposing player told him to leave the pitch quickly, which he did not appreciate. .In Lusail, the exclusion of the team’s talisman is a hot topic, and it has divided fans. .“He should start,” Rui Pomares said. “He is the best player in the world. He is a great player. Awesome footballer. A true legend.” .“His reaction is understandable,” Pomares’ wife, Patricia, argued. “Nobody likes to be substituted, and I don’t believe he should have been taken off.” .“When he retires, we will miss him. The world of football will miss him too,” she added. .But others say Santos was right to put Ronaldo on the bench, not because of his reaction but over his performances at the World Cup. .“I think it is right that he is on the bench, not because of how he reacted but because other players are in better shape and have been playing better than him,” said Jose Antonio, who travelled from Porto for the match. .“Ronaldo has not played great in this tournament,” he said. “Let’s be fair to the other players. He should be brought on as a substitute.” .  .Ronaldo – who is appearing in what is almost certainly his last World Cup – needs one goal to equal Eusebio’s record of nine goals in World Cup matches for Portugal. .But the Portuguese striker has not lit up the competition in Qatar. .He scored a penalty in his team’s opening match against Ghana but has not found the back of the net in the following two matches. .After scoring against the West Africans, Ronaldo became the first player to score at five World Cups. .“I have mixed feelings about this,” David Afonso said. “Ronaldo is still a very good player, but our team can play better without him, and they have shown that.” .“Ronaldo wants to play every game and wants to win everything, so it was not unexpected how he reacted,” Afonso said. “I feel Ronaldo still has a lot to give to our team.” .Ronaldo came into the tournament in the middle of a storm after he gave an interview in which he criticised his then-Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag. .His contract at the English Premier League side was terminated by mutual consent after the explosive TV interview. .Since making his debut in 2003,  Ronaldo has scored 118 goals in 194 games for Portugal. .He has found the back of the net for his country every year for the past 19 years. .In September 2021, Ronaldo broke the world record for international goals scored when he put two past Ireland.",184
185,Published On 6 Dec 2022,Recap: Morocco vs Spain – World Cup 2022,Atlas Lions edge past Spain on penalties to become the first Arab country to reach World Cup quarter-finals.,".Morocco have booked their place in the World Cup’s quarter-finals after a sensational penalty shootout win against Spain, becoming the first Arab country to ever reach the tournament’s last eight. .The Atlas Lions’ Spanish-born superstar wing-back Achraf Hakimi brought the curtain down on Tuesday’s last-16 clash at the Education City Stadium, notching the winner from the spot to make it 3-0 on penalties and sending the tens of thousands of raucous Moroccan fans in attendance into rapture. .Pablo Sarabia, Carlos Soler and captain Sergio Busquets missed their penalties for Spain; Sarabia hit the post and Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou stopped the other two. .It was a goalless deadlock after the 120 minutes of normal and extra time and penalty kicks were necessary to break the impasse. .Morocco will next face either Portugal or Switzerland in the quarter-finals on Saturday. The Atlas Lions are the only team from outside Europe or South America still in the tournament. .Spain had been hoping they could repeat their 2010 World Cup triumph in Qatar after a promising run at Euro 2020 that saw them reach the semi-finals before being beaten on penalties by Italy. .Coach Luis Enrique said before Tuesday’s showdown with Morocco that he had instructed his players to take “at least 1,000 penalties” in the build-up to the World Cup in a bid to ensure they were ready to deal with the pressure of a penalty shoot-out. . .But their preparation came up short in the heat of the contest, with Sarabia striking the post from Spain’s first penalty having been specifically sent on in anticipation of the shoot-out. .His miss came after Abdelhamid Sabiri had sent Morocco 1-0 ahead in the shootout, and paved the way for Hakim Ziyech to net for the Atlas Lions and put them 2-0 ahead. .Soler then saw his effort saved by Yassine Bounou, Morocco’s 31-year-old Canadian-born goalkeeper, before Badr Benoun also missed for Morocco. .Busquets was unable to turn the tide with his tame effort, leaving the stage set for Hakimi to step up and nonchalantly guide his side to victory with a calm chipped shot down the centre of goal, sometimes called a “Panenka”. .Spain had enjoyed more than 75 percent of possession during normal and extra time, completing nearly 1,000 passes in total, but managed just a single shot on target prior to the penalty shoot-out. .The Spanish spent big chunks of the match just orbiting Morocco’s penalty area without attempting any shots, through-balls or moves to break down their well-organised opponents. .Morocco, meanwhile, caused problems for Enrique’s side on the counterattack, forcing goalkeeper Unai Simon to make several good saves. .The Atlas Lions used the pace of Hakim Ziyech and Soufiane Boufal to great effect and a foul on the latter gave the African side the first scoring opportunity as Achraf Hakimi blazed over a free-kick. .Defender Nayef Aguerd later headed over, while Marco Asensio hit the side-netting for Spain. .Dani Olmo recorded Spain’s first shot on target in the 54th minute with an angled shot which Bounou palmed away. .Enrique then sent on Alvaro Morata and Nico Williams in a bid to inject life into his team, but Morocco dug deep to get through extra time without conceding. Their resolute display ensured they finished as deserved winners following Spain’s subsequent collapse in the penalty shootout.",185
186,Published On 6 Dec 2022,Excited Moroccan fans scramble for last-minute World Cup tickets,Their side has entered the final 16 of the World Cup for the first time in 36 years.,".While the spirited atmosphere at Education Stadium on Tuesday before the Morocco-vs-Spain World Cup round-of-16 match was overwhelmingly dominated by Moroccan fans, not all Atlas Lions’ fans were happy. .For days, many Moroccans have been looking for tickets to the game on Tuesday, the first time their team has made it to the second round of the FIFA World Cup in 36 years. .Nider Abdel Magid said he had been waiting outside the Education City Metro station since 1pm (10:00 GMT), “desperately” hoping to get a last-minute ticket to the game. .“I have been looking for tickets for three or four days … and I am really frustrated that I still don’t know if I can watch the game,” the 61-year-old retired engineer from Kenitra, some 50km (31 miles) from capital Rabat, told Al Jazeera. .He added that he is “very angry” since he had extended his stay in Qatar after Morocco qualified for the round of 16. .The Royal Moroccan Football Federation said on Monday it had 5,000 tickets to distribute among Moroccans in Doha — sparking hope among fans. .Hisham and Hatem, two friends, said they had barely slept in the past 24 hours, as they have tried to buy tickets online. “On the [FIFA] website, we sometimes wait for two or three hours before we can enter the portal to buy tickets,” said Hisham, who lives in Amsterdam, but is originally from the southern Moroccan coastal city of Agadir. .Hisham said it was like a “jungle-like” situation at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center (DECC), where they, like hundreds of others, rushed to get tickets. “They kept saying they have tickets, but all of a sudden … they told us to leave after we lined up for more than two hours,” he added. .“People were cutting lines … It was chaotic,” he said, adding that there were some scuffles. .His friend Hatem said they also tried to get tickets from scalpers but the tickets were “very expensive”. .“One guy I talked to said he will take $800 … I was like that’s crazy,” he added. .Both Hatem and Hisham said attending the match would be the “best part” of their trip to Qatar. .“I will be very disappointed if I can’t watch inside the stadium … going to this match will be like the cherry on top … this game is historic for us,” Hisham said. The friends have watched two games at the World Cup so far. .It’s a sentiment shared by Abdel Magid, who described himself as a “die-hard fan” of the Moroccan team. He has camped at the DECC over the past two days in search of tickets. .Yet, what matters most to him, he said, is a win for his side. That, more than anything else, is what would make him “happy”, he said.",186
187,Published On 6 Dec 2022,"Win World Cup for Pele, Brazil football fans tell team","The three-time champion, hospitalised with colon cancer, continues to inspire fans globally.",".Doha, Qatar – Thousands of singing and dancing Brazil fans have been cheering for their team at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but in their hearts they have been saying a silent prayer for their “king”, Pele. .When Brazil cruised past South Korea for a place in the quarter-finals, these fans had a simple request for the team: Win the World Cup for Pele. .Pele, whose real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, has been battling colon cancer, and was hospitalised following a respiratory infection last week. He was part of Brazil’s World Cup-winning teams in 1958, 1962 and 1970. .“For us, Pele is the king,” said Arlem, a Brazil fan from Rio de Janeiro, as she pointed to an imaginary crown above her head. “We love him. We idolise him and we want him to live a long and healthy life so he can watch Brazil win the World Cup.” .While many fans present in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup have grown up hearing tales of Pele’s greatness and watched old videos of his goal-scoring prowess, some were lucky enough to watch him play live. . .Flamenco, a football fan from Colombia, saw Pele play in Mexico City when Brazil beat Italy in the final of the 1970 World Cup. “Pele will always be the best footballer ever,” he told Al Jazeera. .Flamenco said Pele’s achievements make him stand out among all those who have come before and after him. “Diego Maradona was very good, and Lionel Messi is a wonderful player but Pele? He won three World Cups, how can anyone match him?” .Ronnie and Mary Portillo, a Colombian couple who grew up watching Pele weave his magic, agreed. “As he grew in stature, he took the sport to new heights,” Mary said. .Pele sits at the top of Brazil’s all-time goal-scorers’ list with 77 goals in 92 matches. Mary credited Pele and his Brazilian side of the 1960s with introducing the concept of “jogo bonito” (the beautiful game) to the world, and said, “Brazilians are the best players, they always play jogo bonito.” .There was plenty of jogo bonito on display on Monday night as Brazil scored four goals in their first knockout game of the current World Cup, and looked like scoring plenty more. .Before the team took to the pitch at Stadium 974, they were sent a motivational message by the legend himself. In a message posted on his Instagram account on Monday, Pele told the Brazil team that he would be following the game from his hospital bed. .“I’ll watch the game from here at the hospital and I’ll be rooting for each one of you,” he wrote.
The 82-year-old icon urged Brazil to extend their record of World Cup trophies by winning another one in Qatar. . .The team, in turn, held up a large Pele banner as they celebrated their win with the fans. Afterwards, the players dedicated their win to Pele, and said they would like to lift the trophy for him. “He needs a lot of strength from us and this victory is for him, so that he can come out of this situation and that we can be champions for him,” said Vinícius Júnior, who scored Brazil’s first goal. .At the stadium, yellow-shirt clad fans of the Selecao – as the Brazilian team is known – celebrated their team’s win with joyful abandon. But the mere mention of Pele’s name evoked a different set of emotions in them. Renato Pelaquim, from Sao Paulo, struggled for words to explain what Pele has meant for several generations of Brazilians. .“He put Brazil on the world map with his football, and brought many years of hope and joy to the Brazilian people,” Pelaquim said. “By bringing three World Cup titles to Brazil, he (Pele) gave immeasurable happiness to people who had seen years of hardships and sorrow.” .Now, Pelaquim said, it’s time for the current generation of Brazil’s stars to step up for their hero. .“Our country is going through an economic and political turmoil again, so we need this team to do the same and make people forget their pain, and give Pele his last wish,” he said.",187

He said this comment angered Eto’o who then attacked him. .Al Jazeera could not verify if it was Mamouni who was attacked. .Eto’o, a four-time African Player of the Year, is the second most-capped player in Cameroon’s history behind Rigobert Song, the current manager of the national team. .Eto’o also enjoyed an illustrious club career, winning the Champions League on four occasions with three different teams.",188

191,Published On 6 Dec 2022,Hope and optimism in Morocco ahead of World Cup last-16 match,Morocco are on the verge of making history as they take on former winners Spain in the last-16 match.,".The perennial underachievers are finally soaring at a World Cup. .Morocco are on the verge of qualifying for a World Cup quarter-final, a feat that the team has never achieved in five previous World Cup appearances. .A draw against World Cup 2018 finalists Croatia was followed by a shock win over Belgium and a defeat of Canada in the group stages. Suddenly, Moroccans started believing, wishing for the dream to continue. .On Tuesday, the sun rose in Morocco, bringing hope and expectations. .Most cafés in Morocco now are draped in flags and banners. Some have set special menus and have not only added more TVs but also upgraded the existing ones to bigger and better screens, hoping to attract more patrons. .If fans want to watch the game at a café, they need to go at least two hours prior to kickoff, or reserve a table the night before. Without that, seats are difficult to find. .Cinemas will be screening the match instead of movies. Local musicians have been invited to cheer and sing the national anthem with fans. .Jordan team coach Adnan Hamad, who hails from Iraq, had labelled the Moroccan team as the “dark horse” of the tournament. .“That team is considered the best Arab team playing in the Qatar World Cup. It has 20 professional players from major European leagues. In the qualifiers, it passed with flying colours and has a major chance of progressing from the group,” he told Al Jazeera before the start of the contest. .“I believe that the Moroccan team has the best set of players, and the opportunity is in their hands to be the dark horse of the tournament.” .Qualifying for the World Cup was a huge deal for the country but after it did, all eyes were set on progressing from the group stages. .“I’m scared. Not because I don’t believe in the team. All we can do is support and cheer and have faith,” Moroccan supporter Kaoutar told Al Jazeera in Marrakesh. “Spain is a strong team and has achieved quite a lot. But let’s stay optimistic and hope for the best.” .Another fan, Mohammed, meanwhile, is more optimistic: “I strongly believe that we will crash Spain. We have a strong team that can take Spain and any other team down and stay in the World Cup. Even if we lose, I will still go out and celebrate because as a Moroccan I’m proud of the team. We’re the only team left that represents Arabs and that’s quite amazing.” .For some, including fan Mehdi, there is a bit of superstition involved. .“I will not cheer and talk about the team until Tuesday. If someone asks, I will say that we have no chance against Spain but deep down, I think we can make history. I used this tactic for all previous matches and look, we’re still in the World Cup,” he said. .National TV channels are airing daily football segments in the news bulletins to show the players throughout their workouts and preparations, live footage of them getting ready for the match, and interviews with team officials and family members. .The newspapers are writing about the new coach, how he succeeded in building the team and also lauding the players on how they have performed so far. World Cup fever, coupled with the team’s showing, has firmly gripped the nation. .On match day, there are flags everywhere, people are singing national songs on the streets and screaming midfielder Hakim Ziyech’s name. They also have a message for Moroccan supporters in Qatar: be as loud and cheerful as possible so the players feel like they’re playing in Casablanca. .And that request is being answered in the Gulf. .“This team is making the hearts of all Moroccans beat as one. The pride, excitement – and fear – this is something we’ve not seen since 1986,” Yasmina Bennani, a Moroccan supporter in Qatar, said. “To go past the first round was the first football joy for the young generation and it’s beautiful because what’s happening on the pitch is bringing together children of the Moroccan diaspora, born all over Europe.” .For Boutaina Essadiki, the team’s performance has been a shining light not only for Moroccans but all Arab football fans. .“The win [over Spain] will be a victory for all Arab teams,” Essadiki said. “I’m so proud to be a Moroccan right now. And given the situation, even if I wasn’t a Moroccan I’d like to be one to join in and celebrate.” .Back in Essaouira, a port city in the western Moroccan region of Marrakesh-Safi on the Atlantic Ocean, a huge screen has been set up in a famous square called Place Moulay Hassan to telecast all the national team’s games. .A video shared after the win over Belgium showed fans and police officials dancing together. .Moroccans across the world, and some neutral fans, will be hoping the dancing continues. .“Most people didn’t have faith in us that we can beat Belgium and qualify. But look at us now, we’ve qualified for the last 16 and will hopefully win against Spain and continue the journey to the final,” Sami, a Moroccan supporter, said. .“We have every right to dream.

192,Published On 6 Dec 2022,"Asian, African fans relish ‘affordable’, close-to-home World Cup",Proximity and ease of access have allowed fans who can’t afford travel to the West to finally live their dreams.,".Doha, Qatar – It’s the first time that four teams from Asia and Africa have made it to the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. In-form Morocco are still in the fray. But for many fans from those continents, including the Middle East, there’s another reason to celebrate the ongoing tournament: It’s simply easier and more affordable to attend. .Saudi Arabia and India sit at the top of the list of countries with the most applications for Hayya Cards – which fans need to enter Qatar for the World Cup – according to figures released by FIFA after the completion of the tournament’s group stage. .While Saudi Arabia played at the World Cup and pulled off its first big upset, beating Argentina 2-1, India has never come close to qualifying for football’s premier event. Still, visitors from India accounted for 34 percent of the total arrivals during the group stages. .Mohit Kayan, who came to Doha from Mumbai, said the reason is simple: the World Cup is in Qatar, on the Arabian Peninsula, which is part of West Asia. “It’s a proud moment for all of us [Asians] that the continent is hosting its second World Cup [after Japan and South Korea in 2002], especially since it is so close to India,” Kayan told Al Jazeera. .Kayan arrived in Doha for a match-day visit via Dubai, where his friends joined him on a shuttle flight. “We arrived on the morning of the game, took a bus to the stadium and will now head back to Dubai after spending a few hours at the fan festival,” he said. .Such ease of travel – getting from Mumbai to Doha takes only as long as flying from the north of India to its southern cities – would have been unthinkable for fans like Kayan if the World Cup were being held in Europe or South America. .Hayya Card holders with match tickets are exempt from needing a visa to enter Qatar. That, too, has helped, said fans. Jin, a football fan from Malaysia, said not having to worry about a complicated visa process allowed him to convince his friends to join him on his trip. “Visa requirements and flight costs have always held us back from attending the World Cup,” he said. .Indeed, attending the 2026 World Cup – to be held jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico – is already off the table for Jin. .“The next World Cup is in North America, and flights alone would cost us more than what we have spent on our entire trip to Qatar, so we can’t even think about going there,” he said. .The cheapest flight from Kuala Lumpur to Doha in early December cost $700, compared to $1,900 for a flight to New York City. .For others, like Zahra S from Bahrain, a World Cup in the Middle East has helped them realise a lifelong dream. “I have always been a football fan but never considered attending a World Cup until now,” she said. .Zahra and her cousin Zaynab have been staying at the fan village in Al Khor, 50km (31 miles) from Doha, and said they have not felt uncomfortable or unsafe at their accommodation or inside stadiums. “Now that we have seen how convenient it has been to be a part of the World Cup, we are definitely going to attend another one if it is hosted by a Gulf nation,” she said. .Fans from Morocco, one of the two African countries to qualify for the knock-out stage, have been among the most boisterous group of supporters at the tournament. From gathering at the stadiums in the thousands to marching across fan zones to drumbeats and loud chants, fans of the Atlas Lions have painted the town red with their team’s colours. .Rachid and his friends from Oujda in northeast Morocco have been following the team since their first game of the tournament. “We can be here to support our team without feeling out of place,” Rachid said.",192

It was difficult to lose but Japanese football is without a doubt, making progress,” he said. .  .Coach Moriyasu tried to soften the blow of another knockout loss, saying the team had entered a “new era”. .“We cannot be superheroes in one go,” Moriyasu said. “We have to improve step-by-step. But Japan is reaching a level where we can play on the world stage.” .“These players can look eye-to-eye with anyone now and take confidence in who we beat,” he said. .Moriyasu had addressed his team at the centre of the field after their loss to Croatia. Many players slumped on the ground, others cried, and everyone consoled anyone within reach. .“Although the result was not what we expected, I told them (the players) that it doesn’t negate everything they did,” Moriyasu said later. .“But we could not break through the round of 16 and see a new landscape.” .Moriyasu praised the Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic who stopped three penalty shots by Japan in the shootout. .“We have to accept this result,” the coach said. “But whether we succumbed to pressure, I don’t think so. I think the goalkeeper was great.” .Japan’s goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda addressed the failure directly. .“We came up short,” he said. “We did everything we could the last four years.” .South Korea’s Son Heung-min – a superstar from the United Kingdom’s Premier League and the best Asian player in the world – said his team “gave everything” in the battle against Brazil, but it was not enough. .“Brazil is the favourite, look at their players. If you give them spaces they score,” said Son, who recovered in time from an eye socket fracture to feature in Qatar, wearing a mask to protect his face during matches. .“I’m so proud of what we’ve done and I don’t want to blame any of our players because they gave everything,” he said. .As co-hosts of the World Cup with Japan in 2002, South Korea had reached the semi-finals under Dutch coach Guus Hiddink. That year the side and went down in football history as the first team from outside Europe and the Americas to reach the last four. .South Korea’s Portuguese coach Paulo Bento had moved to temper expectations even before the first game in Qatar, not wanting to burden his side with the pressure of having to qualify for the knockouts after three group stage exits at previous World Cup tournaments. .“I believe our participation at the World Cup has ended in a very fair manner,” Bento said after the Brazil match, where he also confirmed that he was leaving his role as the Korean team’s coach. .“I have to thank them for everything, they gave their best. I have been proud to be their manager,” said Bento, who had been in his position since 2018. .Though their dreams of a World Cup win have ended, South Korea’s supporters said they were proud of how far their team had come. .Thousands of fans in Seoul braved the cold and snow in the early hours of Tuesday morning to watch their side’s World Cup run end in a 4-1 win for Brazil. South Korea’s news agency Yonhap reported that a capacity crowd of 33,000 fans attended an outdoor match-watching party in the city centre, despite snow flurries and temperatures that dropped below zero (32 degrees Fahrenheit). .“The result is not important,” 22-year-old student Lee Hyun-seo told the Associated Press at the outdoor event. .“Thanks to our players, it was really cool and proud just to have reached the round of 16.” .Kim Jae-cheol, 25, another student at the event, said the Brazilian team’s victory was expected and the loss would not diminish support for the South Korean side. .“I will keep supporting the Korean team and I think we will be able to go to the quarter-finals and semi-finals someday if we continue to play our own style.”",193

But just a week later, the Swiss scored in the first minute and survived a barrage of Portugal attacks in an organised and resolute defensive display that helped them win 1-0. .Those contests serve as a reminder that while Portugal head into Tuesday’s match at the Lusail Stadium as favourites, Switzerland have the ability to eclipse them and register another shock result at a World Cup that has been defined by against-the-odds surprises. .Portugal topped their qualification group, scoring six goals across three matches. Switzerland finished second in their group after winning their final game 3-2 against Serbia in dramatic fashion. .For Portugal, the build-up to Tuesday’s match has been dominated by discussions over Ronaldo’s behaviour. The 37-year-old forward appeared angry after being withdrawn 25 minutes from the end of his side’s 2-1 loss to South Korea in their last group game. .Portugal coach Fernando Santos later said he was unimpressed with Ronaldo’s conduct and refused to confirm whether he would captain the side against Switzerland after leading his country in their first three fixtures in Qatar. .There has been speculation that Ronaldo, who claimed his frustration was aimed at an opposing player rather than Santos for taking him off, may be dropped altogether following the incident. .For Switzerland, who are aiming to reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in 68 years, goalkeeper Yann Sommer and defender Nico Elvedi have been declared fit to play after recovering from illness. .Their return to fitness means coach Murat Yakin has a full squad available to pick from. .",194
195,Published On 6 Dec 2022,Morocco’s World Cup magic potion: Football parents and fans,Forget Wags. The secret of Morocco’s success at World Cup 2022 might come down to the players’ parents who have joined them.,".After Morocco shocked the footballing world by defeating pre-tournament favourites Belgium 2-0 in a Group F play, Paris Saint-Germain fullback Achraf Hakimi made a beeline for his mother in the stands. .Their embrace and subsequent cheek-pinch went viral across social media platforms. The 24-year-old footballer later posted an Instagram photo of him planting a kiss on his mother’s forehead with the caption, “I love you, Mom”. .But Hakimi’s mother is not the only Moroccan football parent who has travelled to Qatar to support her son at the 2022 World Cup. .On the instructions of coach Walid Regragui and Royal Moroccan Football Federation president Fouzi Lekjaa, family members chosen by all Moroccan squad members are entitled to an all-inclusive trip to Qatar. .As a result, Morocco’s base at the Wyndham Doha West Bay hotel occasionally feels like an adorable parent-run summer camp. For some, like Regragui’s mother, Fatima, the trip was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. .“During his whole career as a player and as a coach, I never travelled to watch him,” she told Moroccan sports channel Arriyadia. “I’ve been living in France for more than 50 years now and this is the first competition that I left Paris for.” .Midfielder Abdelhamid Sabiri’s parents have been the camera-toting kind. They spent a few days traipsing about the hotel, securing souvenir pictures with Chelsea midfielder Hakim Ziyech, Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bono, and, of course, coach Regragui. .Whenever television boom microphones have been shoved in their faces, the proud parents of Moroccan players have gushed about their children and how they consider all of the “boys” on the squad as their very own. .Apart from heart-warming social media posts, creating positive energy is part of Regragui’s strategy of obtaining intangible advantages that will translate on the pitch. He said as much immediately after taking the job, at the Mohamed VI Complex in Maamoura, when he declared: “Our success is not possible without our parents’ happiness.” . .Morocco are no favourites in this World Cup, but by reaching the round of 16 for the first time since 1986, they have already thrilled their fans and families. They have also emerged as a team many neutrals are rooting for — emotional scenes like Hakimi’s with his mother likely help. .But there is another element to the magic potion that is carrying Morocco’s hopes: the droves of Moroccan supporters who have made Qatari stadiums their second home. .At least 15,000 Moroccans live in Qatar and several thousand more, from all over the world, have made the trip to the first Arab-hosted World Cup, generating intimidating atmospheres for opposition teams in each of their group-stage matches. .Perhaps the most pertinent example of home support helping the Atlas Lions came in the final stages of the match against Belgium. After taking a 1-0 lead with 15 minutes to play, Morocco prepared to absorb pressure and launch counterattacks. Had the World Cup been in Europe or South America, where there would have been markedly less home support in attendance, those 15 minutes could have felt like an hour. .Instead, a cacophony of whistles and boos rained upon the Belgian players at Al Thumama Stadium whenever they took possession of the ball. Cathartic roars erupted from the stands whenever the ball was cleared. .“I swear to God if the supporters weren’t here, we wouldn’t have advanced to the next round!” Regragui exclaimed, after the final match of group play. .Combine the pressure that Moroccan supporters have doled out on the opposition in Qatar with the scientific evidence pointing to the higher testosterone levels that home teams enjoy, and the North African side has had plenty to thank their supporters for. .Sure, that does not take away from the quality of the players themselves, who have outperformed other Arab sides in the World Cup. But before their round-of-16 clash versus Spain, demand for tickets has been so high that the Moroccan football federation procured an extra 5,000 tickets for supporters. .Draped in their regal red flags and armed with darbuka goblet drums, Moroccan supporters will likely turn Education City into another home venue on Tuesday evening. .There is a quarter-final berth on the line, but there is also a deeper sociological context that undergirds Morocco’s clash with Spain. .After facing off against Belgium, Morocco will be playing against a second Western European country with a sizeable Moroccan diaspora. In all, 137 players at the 2022 World Cup represent a country different from the country they were born in. .That includes 14 of the 26 players in Regragui’s squad — making Morocco the most reliant on diaspora talent of the 32 nations competing in Qatar. .Yet while such a scenario could in theory complicate team chemistry, since players have different upbringings, this mishmash of birthplaces appears to have worked for Morocco. One reason, according to parents of the players: Those in the diaspora are possibly even bigger fans of the Moroccan national team than some at home. .At the Wyndham last week, many of the players’ parents boasted about their children’s passion for the national team and their decision to represent Morocco instead of seeking to play for the country of their birth. .Striker Zakaria Aboukhlal’s father, Tarek, said: “He’s [Zakaria] born in Holland, and he has everything he needs there, but our blood is Moroccan.” .Midfielder Bilal el-Khannouss’s father was even crisper in articulating why his Belgium-born son chose to play for Morocco. “His heart spoke to him,” the father said. .Immediately after securing qualification to the round of 16, Regragui, who was born in France, admitted that he had been thinking of the 1986 World Cup, when the team last made it out of the group stages. “At the time I was living in the French suburbs, and when Morocco beat Portugal, it was the happiest I’d ever been in my life,” he said. .Now his team is on the verge of climbing new heights: A place in the World Cup quarter-finals would be unprecedented. Spain will be the bookies’ choice, yet Morocco have shown the world what they are capable of during this tournament. .The mommy love is helping.",195

An earlier dispute between Ziyech and Halilhodžić had led to the mercurial winger being axed from the side. .His creativity provides Morocco with its most potent attacking threat but it is their resolute defensive play that has attracted plaudits. .The goal they conceded to Canada during their 2-1 victory in their final Group F encounter was the first in Regragui’s six-game reign. .Morocco’s goalkeeper, Yassine Bounou, said the team had already “made history” by reaching the last 16 but said it wanted to achieve “more” yet. .“Spain will force us to be at our best,” Bounou told reporters on Sunday. .“[But] we are thoroughly prepared. We have got better and better with each passing game, and I’m sure we’ll be in good shape,” he added. “We want to make our people happy.” .Spain, for their part, will need to produce a much-improved performance from the defeat to Japan in their last outing. .La Roja put on a masterclass in passing during the first 45 minutes of that game but made defensive blunders in the second half which saw coach Luis Enrique’s men concede twice in six minutes. They only avoided exiting the tournament altogether on account of a superior goal difference to Germany. .Midfielder turned-centre back Rodri said his side will not change their tiki-taka approach just because of the loss but had focused on learning from their errors. .“We have learnt from our mistakes, and we will try to avoid them, but we are not going to change our football style for those mistakes … it is not good to change our football philosophy. We will stick with that,” Rodri told reporters on Sunday. .He also promised not to take Morocco, ranked 15 places below the 2010 champions, lightly. .“[They are] one of the top teams in Africa. So, I think they are a very, very strong team,” Rodri said. “You can see the names they have there, the players they have with quality, with power. I think it’s going to be very, very tough.” .Tuesday’s fixture will mark the second time Spain and Morocco have played against one another at a World Cup. .Their previous meeting came in 2018, when the sides drew 2-2 during a group stage encounter. .The winner of this week’s clash will face either Portugal or Switzerland on December 10.",196

Switzerland finished second in their group after winning their final game 3-2 against Serbia in dramatic fashion. It was a match where all rules went out the window as Switzerland lost their typically reliable defensive shape, searching for a winner. .But as exciting as that game was, Switzerland will know that against a free-scoring Portugal, they must return to the familiar organised display that frustrated Brazil and Cameroon in the first two group-stage matches. .Ronaldo is 37 years old but is still a major goal-scoring threat, as is Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes, who scored twice against Uruguay. Joao Felix has also produced some fine performances showing why Atletico Madrid forked out $132m for the winger in 2019. .Switzerland do not boast such big-name forwards. Still, former Liverpool winger Xherdan Shaqiri has looked lively this tournament, and forward Breel Embolo, who has scored twice, will look to pressure the veteran defender Pepe with his pace and strength. .Pepe has been forced to deputise for Paris Saint-Germain’s Danilo Pereira after the centre-back broke several ribs during a training session. .The two sides have met on five occasions in all, with Portugal winning three and Switzerland two. .Switzerland have a penchant for causing an upset at major tournaments, knocking out France at the 2020 Euros in a thrilling comeback that left a shell-shocked French team fighting among themselves. .The winner of this match will face the victor of the Morocco-Spain game earlier on Tuesday.",197

The Paris Saint-Germain number 10 was brought down by his marker and the ball ended up at the feet of Vinicius Jr, in acres of space. .The Real Madrid star steadied himself before placing it to the right of Kim Seung-gyu in the South Korean goal. .Just three minutes later, Richarlison was brought down by Jung Woo-young inside the box, and the referee pointed to the spot. Neymar, who had reportedly flown his barber out to Qatar to dye his hair blonde following previous victories over South Korea with bleached hair, wasted no time in slotting it into the bottom-right of the net. Brazil was up two-nil with less than 15 minutes on the clock. .South Korea had their share of chances, with Hwang Hee-chan, fresh off scoring the winner against Portugal, having a go from a distance but sending the ball comfortably over the bar. Moments later, Allison was forced to make a diving save to his left, his first save of the tournament. .But Paolo Bento’s men were simply outclassed in every part of the pitch. .A remarkable piece of skill in the 26th minute saw Richarlison juggling the ball, heading it to himself three times while evading defenders on the edge of the South Korean box. He then passed the ball before running through on goal to receive the return, firing the ball in for Brazil’s third. .Just 10 minutes later, Vinicius Jr set up Lucas Paqueta with a cheeky chip, and the midfielder shot low and right. Kim Seung-gyu could do little but look at the ball nestling in the back of the net. .With four goals before half-time, Brazil was putting down a marker for any teams who think they might have a chance of lifting the trophy on December 18. .Son Heung-min nearly clawed one back for South Korea straight after the restart, but Alisson — who must, through this game alone, be in contention for the Golden Glove — got enough of his arm onto the shot to tip it wide. .Faced with the intensity of Brazil’s onslaught, South Korea tried to slow the game, but more chances for Raphinha and Vinicius Jr followed despite the best efforts of the men in red. .Then came the 77th minute, and out of nowhere, Paik Seung-ho scored from outside the box. A free kick for South Korea was bundled clear by the Brazilian defence, falling to Paik, who belted it past Alisson’s dive to find the top-right corner. Finally, the South Korean fans had something to cheer about. .South Korea continued to work hard in defence and create chances in attack, but that goal was to be their only score, and they head home having been soundly beaten by one of the best teams in the world. .Brazil will face Croatia in the quarter-finals at Education City on Friday.",200

202,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Recap: Japan vs Croatia – World Cup 2022,Croatia beat Japan 3-1 on penalties to book their place in the quarter-finals of the World Cup.,".Croatia have beaten Japan on penalties in a closely fought World Cup last 16 tie, to claim a place in the quarter-finals. .Mario Pasalic scored the winning spot kick to see Croatia through 3-1 on penalties on Monday in the tournament’s last game at the Al Janoub Stadium in Wakrah, south of Qatar’s capital. .A goalless extra time followed 90 minutes that had finished 1-1 with goals from Japan’s Daizen Maeda and Croatia’s Ivan Perisic. .Perisic and Croatia captain Luka Modric, experienced penalty takers, had both been taken off the pitch before the final whistle. .Japan’s first two penalties, from Takumi Minamino and Kaoru Mitoma, were saved by Croatian keeper Dominik Livakovic, who will surely now be a national hero back home. Both Croatia’s first two efforts were slotted into the net. .Takuma Asano scored with Japan’s third shot. Croatia’s Marko Livaja stepped up with a casual effort but hit it into the post. Japanese captain Maya Yoshida’s poorly struck penalty was also saved. Pasalic took the final, successful kick, to dash Japan’s dreams. .For much of the first half, Japan were happy to sit back, allowing Croatia to take the majority of possession, instead focusing on lightning-quick counterattacks. This, don’t forget, was a team who had beaten both Germany and Spain in the group stage. .Croatia had a great spell of play just before the half-hour mark, with Modric looping in pinpoint crosses, which his teammates failed to convert into anything more than sustained pressure in Japan’s box. .Japan’s effort and endeavours paid off in the 42nd minute, with Celtic’s Daizen Maeda getting onto the end of a scrappy corner for a well-deserved goal in front of the 42,523-strong crowd. .Modric commanded the midfield as ever, the Croatian captain leading an experienced and solid line, but Croatia lacked attacking options to take the game to Japan’s back four – and for a lot of the time, lacked the desire to score. .A gorgeous Croatian cross in the 54th minute was met with a golden header; a play out of nothing, out of nowhere – an experimental, probing, delivery simply fell comfortably for Ivan Perisic, whose headed shot bent inside the post for the equaliser. .The move sparked life into the game. Japan’s Wataru Endo attempted a reply just two minutes later, a curling effort which had to be tipped over the bar by keeper Livakovic. .With 15 minutes of normal time remaining, the ball fell again to Perisic, who let fly a corker of a shot, though a deflection from Takehiro Tomiyasu sent it high and wide. .Extra time had a sluggish start, but Japan looked certain to score on the stroke of halfway, though Kaoru Mitoma’s mazy run ended with a bolting strike straight into Livakovic’s gloves. .The second period of extra time saw Japan raise their energy levels, but a breakthrough could still not be found. Croatia finally had a real chance in the 30th minute of extra time, but Lovro Majer snatched at it, sending it wide. And it was down to penalties. .Croatia may not have had the best of this game, but they are the ones going through to the quarter-finals to face the winner of tonight’s clash between five-time winners Brazil and South Korea at Education City on Friday.",202
203,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Why is there so much stoppage time at World Cup 2022?,A total of 563 minutes – more than nine hours – added to the clock at the World Cup.,".Football history is being rewritten at Qatar’s 2022 World Cup. .Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal against Ghana made him the first male player to score in five World Cups. Lionel Messi has played his 1,000th match and scored his first knockout-stage goal. Oliver Giroud scored his 52nd goal for France, a record for the team. .But when England pulverised Iran 6-2, the match set a more obscure FIFA record: It was the longest World Cup group stage match. .By the time the final whistle blew, both sides had played 117 minutes. The marathon match had stretched an extra 27 minutes across both halves due to a series of stoppages that were added as part of FIFA’s relatively new time-policing efforts. .During the group stages, referees added a total of 563 minutes of play – more than nine hours. Only one of the tournament’s eight opening games finished under 100 minutes. .In the 1-1 draw between Wales and the USA, 14 minutes and 34 seconds were added to the clock while 12 minutes and 49 seconds were tacked onto the Netherlands vs Senegal game. The opening match between Qatar and Ecuador saw 10 minutes and 18 seconds of stoppage time. .So why has there been so much stoppage time at the 2022 World Cup? .Football matches are supposed to be 90 minutes of normal time unless it’s a knockout match. FIFA’s fourth officials routinely add time at the end of each half. .At the 2018 World Cup, FIFA began heavily policing stoppage times to account for time spent on injuries, celebrations, video assistant referee (VAR) reviews and substitutions. .Before this year’s World Cup, Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA’s referees committee and a former referee himself, warned fans to brace themselves for a number of games eclipsing 100 minutes. .“This is nothing new,” Collina told reporters in November. “In Russia, it became quite normal for the fourth official to show the board with seven, eight, nine minutes on it.” .The goal for FIFA, he said, is to maximise effective playing time. .“Whenever there will be an incident like treatment, substitution, penalty, red card or celebration of a goal – I want to underline that because it is a moment of joy for one team, for the other maybe not – but it may last one or one and a half minutes,”  he said. .FIFA has long complained about lengthy goal celebrations and unnecessary showboating, which can sometimes span a minute or more. .“So imagine in a half there are two or three goals scored, and it’s easy to lose five or six minutes, and this team must be compensated at the end,” Collina said. .Other football experts have argued that stoppage time should be welcomed by fans looking to get the most bang for their buck after shelling out plenty of money to watch a match at a stadium. .“I think it’s good for the game because fans are just as important as anybody else,” retired FIFA and English Premier League referee Mark Halsey told Al Jazeera. “It costs a lot of money to watch football. We want to see the ball in play longer. That’s what we want. We’re getting 90-plus minutes now.” .VAR has drawn global criticism since its debut at the Russia World Cup. It tracks every limb of players on the pitch and uses semiautomated technology through the use of cameras, sensors and video replay to make offside calls and overturn goals. .In Qatar, specifically, many fans have complained that the technology has cramped the flow of the game, sometimes adding several minutes to a match’s stoppage time. .The stoppages have sewn discord across the football world with some players expressing displeasure about the added time due to the heightened possibility of injury. .During time added on in this World Cup, Iran’s goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand sustained a severe concussion against England. Saudi Arabia defender Yasser Alshahrani was also hurt when he was kneed by his own goalkeeper Mohammed Alowais vs Argentina. .The international players union Fifpro said it’s monitoring the situation. .“If effective playing time is increased by 10 to 15 per cent, this adds substantially to the time under physical competition for players,” Fifpro General Secretary Jonas Baer-Hoffmann said. “More than anything, it underlines how critical workload protection is for players. It needs to be established now.” .Some players, though, appear to be taking a shine to the longer matches. .“Enjoying the amount of time that is being added on by the officials at the Qatar World Cup 2022,” Former England and Liverpool midfielder Jamie Carragher said on Twitter. “There is too much time wasting in football!” . .Domestic football leagues aren’t entirely sold on the new FIFA rules. The Premier League said it won’t implement the strict new time stoppage regulations after the World Cup. .Some fans have even blamed entire match outcomes on the stoppage times. .When Iran scored two goals in stoppage time, cruising to a 2-0 win over Wales, some were quick to pin the Welsh defeat on the new time-maximising initiative. .“Interesting observation,” football YouTuber Mark Goldbridge tweeted on November 25. “Wales lost because of this FIFA directive to add unprecedented amount of stoppage time to games.” .South American football correspondent Tom Vickery likened the stoppages to “adding extra rounds at the end of a boxing match”. .“Not in favor of these giant stoppage times,” Vickery wrote on Twitter. “Grinding the players into the ground. 4 would have been fine. 9? Not for me.” .While stoppage time has decided some matches, it’s also allowed teams to forge history by other means. .Cameroon’s second-half winning goal against Brazil came in stoppage time. While the goal wasn’t enough to score Cameroon a spot in the last 16, Vincent Aboubakar’s conversion, afforded by the added time, made Cameroon the first African nation to beat five-time World Cup champions Brazil. .Over the years, a number of alternatives to stoppage time, designed to crack down on football’s time-wasting, have also been proposed. In 2017, FIFA’s then-technical director, Marco van Basten, proposed a 60-minute, stop-start game clock, not unlike basketball. The idea, however, never was implemented. .Others have suggested that bringing in an independent timekeeper, similar to rugby, could be another alternative to lengthy stoppage time. .“If you’re stopping the clock, it will be the timekeeper stopping that clock every time that ball goes out or every time that ball goes – every time there’s a substitution, every time there’s a goal-scoring celebration – then that timekeeper starts the clock then restarts it when the ball’s back in play,” Halsey told Al Jazeera English. .Halsey cast goalkeepers as the worst repeat offenders when it comes to time theft. .“I was a goalkeeper, so you do see goalkeepers taking their time,” he said. “What they tend to do now, they tend to catch that ball, the ball comes into them and then they fall to the ground with no one around them, lie on the ground, have a little look around, … then they get up and they start to perhaps get the ball back into play. I think you’re looking in excess of more than 10 to 15 seconds when the goalkeeper has a hold of a ball.” .Halsey suggested a time limit of 10 seconds and, if keepers exceed that limit, punishing them with an indirect free kick and a yellow card. .“I think referees do need to be stronger in managing those situations,” he said.",203
204,Published On 5 Dec 2022,‘World Cup Wallace’: Meet Brazilian football’s unofficial drummer,Sixty-year-old Wallace Leite from Sao Paulo has been to every Brazil game with his drum for the past 10 World Cup tournaments.,".Doha, Qatar – Since 1986, nothing has deterred Brazil’s unofficial World Cup drummer Wallace Leite from attending the most prestigious footballing event on the planet. .Age, injuries, family commitments, nothing has kept the Brazilian and his drum from the World Cup. .The 60-year-old from Sao Paulo has been at the last 10 world cups, tirelessly carrying and playing his Surdao (Brazilian drum) at every match featuring the Canarinha – “little canaries” as the Brazilian team is affectionally known owing to their bright yellow team jersey. .“It’s a natural high,” Leite said of drumming and the World Cup. “It’s like I have found the fountain of happiness,” he told Al Jazeera, decked out in the same outfit, featuring shades of Brazil’s national flag that he has worn to all his team’s games at the tournament in Qatar. .He prays the outfit will bring his side luck. .For Leite, it is all about the “positive response” he gets from the hordes of fans that gather around him when he plays the Surdao, in what he calls his “perfect place”. .“There are no issues, no politics, everybody just there supporting Brazil,” he said. .His instrument of choice is the Surdao, a 7kg (15lb) Brazilian drum he played at every World Cup game since the 1990 tournament in Italy. Previous to that, Leite said he had used a smaller type of percussion drum though the pitch was “too high” for his liking. .The Surdao helps keep “the rhythm together”. .“I feel I can move and hype so many more people with [the Surdao],” he adds. .Cutting a slender figure at 79kg (174lb) and 177cm (five feet, nine inches) in height, he admits that banging a large drum at month-long World Cup tournaments takes a physical toll. .“I have had several injuries including hurting my arms, shoulders, and of course neck. I’ll get a massage after the tournament or some therapy,” said Leite, whose day job in the United States, where he lives, is a computer hardware expert. “Many people say, well isn’t it all so hard? And I say yes, it is hard, but the satisfaction is greater. .“It’s just wow,” he adds as a look of wonder crosses his face when he recalls his time playing to crowds in dozens of stadiums over the past decades. .Leite, also known as Wallace Das Copa (World Cup Wallace) by his fans, said people regularly approach him for pictures, interviews and even autographs at the tournaments. .“It’s not like I am some celebrity, but it does make me feel very special.” .Residents in the countries hosting the World Cup have often invited him to their homes for meals or taken him to tourist spots, such as the Kruger Park for a Safari tour in South Africa, a visit to the Kremlin in Moscow, and camel ridding in Qatar. . .“I have made so many friends around the world, learned so much about different cultures and customs, not everyone has a chance to do that. It’s a blessing,” the 60-year-old said proudly. .When asked what had been his favourite host country, he answers diplomatically: “All of them”. .“Every country has so much to offer in terms of kind people, beautiful places to visit. it’s hard to choose,” he said. .His fondest World Cup memories are, he said, “probably Mexico”. .According to Leite, the Mexican “people fell in love” with the Brazilian football team back in 1970 when the World Cup took place there. The team included football legends like Pele, and the Mexican crowds were mesmerised by the team’s uniquely creative style of play. Brazil would go on to win the trophy in Mexico, defeating Italy 4-1 in the final, with Pele scoring four goals in the tournament. .When he arrived in Mexico for his first World Cup in 1986, he said Mexicans “embraced” him like he was one of their own. .“I felt at home in Mexico. Oh my gosh, people were so nice. I didn’t spend any money. People would pay for everything,” he recounted. .“I would go to restaurants where they play mariachi music and they would say ‘let’s stop mariachi, we want to hear Brazilian samba’. In the streets people would be dancing and singing at all times of the day. The interactions I had with people, it was a great feeling.” . .Leite said he “certainly hopes” this will be the year the most coveted trophy in football returns to South America. .Exasperated, he says: “It’s been 20 years since we won.” Brazil last lifted the World Cup – their fifth – in 2002 in Japan. .For the first few tournaments, Leite said his wife Carmen, who works in the fashion industry and also from Sao Paulo, would accompany to all the games. “She would sing with me, dance in the streets,” he noted. .However, as time passed by, the drummer said Carmen would stop coming as frequently. .“It was just not her thing … like it is for me. For her, it became routine.” Leite, who said he prepares for weeks before the tournament even starts, organising his costumes and making new music, Carmen does urge him to spend more time with her and his two adult daughters. .“When the time comes (for the World Cup) she thinks I focus on it too much … that I’m too crazy about it,” he said. “But overall, she supports me.” .When asked how long he sees himself playing his drum at World Cup tournaments, he said he had no “time frame”. .“Only God knows,” he adds. “As long I can move, have good health, shout, and play my instrument, I will keep doing it.”",204

207,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Neymar poised to return for Brazil vs South Korea World Cup match,The Brazilian star missed two group-stage games because of an injury he picked up against Serbia.,".Five-time champions Brazil are set to enter their first knockout match of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with one of their deadliest threats – superstar Neymar – back on the field. .Neymar, and the Brazil team, are expected to play on Monday night against South Korea at 10pm (19:00 GMT) at Stadium 974 after footage released by the Brazilian football federation showed the forward in good condition as he did drills with the ball and took shots on goal a day before the match. .Brazil coach Tite had earlier told reporters he would start with the striker if he was fit to play. .“I prefer to use my best player from the start,” Tite said on Sunday. “It’s the coach who has to make that decision and take on that responsibility.” .Neymar, whose $263m transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 set a record, missed the final two group stage matches against Switzerland and Cameroon after he sustained ligament damage during the opening match against Serbia, which Brazil won 2-0. .Brazil went on to beat Switzerland 1-0 and lose to Cameroon 0-1, with most of the team’s top players given a rest during the match, which came after they had already secured qualification for the knockout round. .Thirty-year-old Neymar is no stranger to injuries, having for years contended with problems in his right foot and ankle that hindered his appearances in the 2014 and 2018 World Cups. .Nevertheless, the talisman’s play-making ability will likely prove fundamental to Brazil’s success going forward as they face an increasingly competitive field in Qatar, with Argentina, England, France, and the Netherlands having already secured their places in the quarterfinals. .That’s particularly true after forward Gabriel Jesus and left-back Alex Telles were ruled out of the rest of the World Cup after sustaining injuries against Cameroon. .Right-back Danilo has also been ruled fit to return, while left-back Alex Sandro will not play against South Korea, who made it to the Round of 16 on goal differential over Uruguay after upsetting Portugal 2-1 in their final group stage match. .On Sunday, South Korea coach Paulo Bento played coy when asked about Neymar’s return, telling reporters: “Obviously we won’t say that it’s better to face Brazil when Neymar is playing, but I always prefer when the best players are there.” .The Asian team’s chances have been also boosted by good news on the injuries front: A healthy Hwang Hee-chan, who scored the decisive goal against Portugal while also struggling with injuries throughout the group stage, is expected to start on Tuesday. .In June, Brazil thrashed South Korea 5-1 in a friendly in Seoul. But Brazil captain Thiago Silva said his team wouldn’t be taking their opponents lightly – even with Neymar back in action. .“We can’t think it’s going to be an easy game like it was in that friendly,” he told reporters. “Now it’s the World Cup and they’ve advanced in a very tough group.

209,Published On 5 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: What the Moroccan football team means to its fans,Moroccans are one win away from making history before their last-16 clash against Spain on Tuesday.,".Doha, Qatar – The sighs of relief were drowned out by sheer ecstasy and delirium inside Al Thumama Stadium when Morocco narrowly edged out Canada in their last group match. .It was not just a win but Morocco’s progress to the last 16 of a World Cup, only the second time the team has achieved in six attempts. .A draw against Croatia, a win against second-ranked Belgium and a defeat of Canada had Moroccans – in Qatar and around the world – dreaming again. But how much longer can they continue dreaming? .Can the team beat Spain on Tuesday and do what it has never done before – reach a football World Cup quarter-final? .“This team is making the hearts of all Moroccans beat as one. The pride, excitement – and fear – this is something we’ve not seen since 1986,” Yasmina Bennani, a Moroccan supporter in Qatar, told Al Jazeera. .No member of the current squad was born in 1986 when Morocco last reached the last 16. .“To go past the first round was the first football joy for the young generation and it’s beautiful because what’s happening on the pitch is bringing together children of the Moroccan diaspora, born all over Europe.” .For Boutaina Essadiki, the team’s performance has been a shining light not only for Moroccans but all Arab football fans. .“The win [over Spain] will be a victory for all Arab teams,” Essadiki said. .“I’m so proud to be a Moroccan right now. And given the situation, even if I wasn’t a Moroccan I’d like to be one to join in and celebrate. .“The team has honoured us by playing amazing football.” .Horia el-Hadad said she was not into football before the start of the World Cup. .“The fact that it’s taking place in an Arab country for the first time, where I live, has been extra meaningful for me, especially since Morocco is now the last remaining Arab team,” she said. .“I feel like the whole Arab world is behind the Moroccan team and the unity has been really heartwarming to see. .“If they manage to beat Spain, this will be a win for the Arab and African world.” .Ibtisam Amzil, who works in Qatar’s capital Doha, said she will “support the team till the end” no matter the result. .“I’m just so happy with the team, I’m supporting them all the way to the end, just like all the Arab people,” Amzil said.“God willing, we will beat Spain and move forward and fulfil the dreams of all Moroccans.” .Prior to the start of the tournament, Jordan’s coach Adnan Hamad had labelled Morocco as the “dark horse of the tournament”. .“The Moroccan team is considered the best Arab team playing in the Qatar World Cup. It has 20 professional players from major European leagues. In the qualifiers, it passed with flying colours and has a major chance of progressing from the group,” Hamad, who hails from Iraq, had told Al Jazeera. .“I believe that the Moroccan team has the best set of players, and the opportunity is in their hands to be the dark horse of the tournament.” .Former world champions Spain are ranked seventh in the world, while Morocco sit 15 places below at 22. .The gap in rankings, and titles, will not count for much when the two sides meet at Education City Stadium, according to Kawtar Ghfir, a Moroccan citizen based in Dubai. .“I hope that my team will win because they not only have the potential and professionalism from the players and the coach but also know very well how eager and thirsty the Moroccans are for a win,” she said. .“Spain is a strong team but that does not mean we’re weak. We will win. .“And that win will mean a lot to us because the country is in love with football, even more so now after watching the team do so well.” .The odds will be stacked against Morocco when the teams line up for the national anthems on Tuesday. Moroccans will hope the national anthem is not played for the last time at World Cup 2022. .“As Moroccans, we typically feel utmost patriotism and pride when we hear our national anthem resound in a crowded football stadium,” said Ismail Chokhman. .“This World Cup has been quite special, where not only more than 40,000 fans were singing along with pride but also the crowd from other Arab nations supporting the same Moroccan team. .“I have witnessed Moroccan fans bursting in tears of joy after the first and second goals [against Belgium] and strangers hugging and kissing each other as if they always knew one another.”",209

211,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Who could win the Golden Boot at the Qatar World Cup 2022?,The prestigious Golden Boot trophy will be awarded to the player with the most goals scored in the tournament.,".It’s all come down to the final match of the World Cup in Qatar: On Sunday, France and Argentina will face off. And there’s stiff competition not just for the Cup, but among some of the world’s best football players over the prestigious Golden Boot trophy. .The Golden Boot is awarded to the individual player with the most goals scored in the tournament. In the case of a tie for goals scored, the number of assists by a player is then considered. .If players are tied on both counts, the winner is decided by who played the fewest minutes. .England captain Harry Kane took the trophy at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, where he scored six goals and led his team to the semifinals. .Here is a snapshot of the top contenders for the Golden Boot at the 2022 World Cup: .The Argentina great has already bagged five goals so far this World Cup, which he has said is probably his last. .The 35-year-old opened his account by burying a penalty kick in a shock Group C loss to Saudi Arabia, before scoring and assisting Enzo Fernandez in an emotionally charged win over Mexico. .Messi also scored in Argentina’s 2-1 win over Australia in the last 16, putting his side ahead after 35 minutes with a coolly taken low strike for his 94th international goal. .He was instrumental in the quarterfinal against the Netherlands and lashed home a second-half penalty in a dramatic game that ended 2-2 after extra time and was won by Argentina on penalties. .Messi’s inspirational display of talent booked the team a place in the World Cup final after they swatted aside Croatia 3-0. He opened the scoring from the penalty spot but saved his best for the third goal when he spun around Josko Gvardiol before jigging along the goal line and passing it off for Julian Alvarez to finish. .The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner has enjoyed a trophy-laden career at the club level, and his fans around the world are hoping he can finally help deliver a World Cup for his country. .The 23-year-old scored against Australia in his side’s opening Group D match and bagged a second-half double against Denmark as France booked their spot in the knockouts. .He failed to find the net as Tunisia recorded a famous upset in their final group match, but he added two more goals to his tally in a 3-1 win against Poland in the round of 16. .Alvarez has scored four goals in his first World Cup, becoming only the second player to score that many in a single edition of the tournament for the Albiceleste. .Messi called the 22-year-old “spectacular” and “extraordinary” after the double against Croatia booked them a place in the final. Alvarez is the youngest player since Pele to score twice in a World Cup semifinal. .The young striker also made an impression by scoring to help Argentina to a 2-1 victory over Australia and to a 2-0 victory over Poland. .Olivier Giroud hasn’t let France feel Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema’s absence at the World Cup. His second-half winner against England was his fourth of the tournament and he’s now scored in successive knockout games. .Giroud’s neat finish in the round of 16 game against Poland saw him overtake Thierry Henry as France’s all-time highest goalscorer. He has scored 53 times for his country since making his debut in 2011. .Player                       Team            Goals      Assists     Games    Minutes .Lionel Messi             Argentina           5             3               6           570 .Kylian Mbappe          France              5              2              6            478 .Julian Alvarez           Argentina           4             0               6           362 .Olivier Giroud           France               4             0               5           379 .Gonçalo Ramos     Portugal               3             1               2            179 .Alvaro Morata           Spain                 3             1              4             206 .Marcus Rashford     England              3             0              5             176 .Enner Valencia        Ecuador              3             0              3             277 .Bukayo Saka           England              3             0              5             313 .Richarlison               Brazil                  3             0              5             257 .Cody Gakpo            Netherlands        3             0              5             490 .* Stats as of December 18, 2022",211
212,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Fans in Japan face another sleepless night for World Cup last 16,This side could become only the second Asian nation to reach the quarter-finals of a World Cup.,".Kagoshima, Japan – Japan take on Croatia in the group of 16 of the World Cup 2022 on Monday. The 6pm (15:00 GMT) kickoff means it will be midnight in Japan when the first whistle is blown. .Many will sacrifice their sleep to watch their team play. With extra time and penalties a possibility, there is a chance that Japanese football fans may be awake and glued to their screens well past 3am. .The wins over Germany and Spain mean that even casual football fans are glued to their screens and are willing to sacrifice their sleep, hoping and praying for one more sleepless night after every match. .Japan progressed beyond the group stage of the World Cup three times but never went beyond the last-16 stage. .The Group E wins over Germany and Spain have created strong hope and belief that Hajime Moriyasu’s team can become the first to cross that barrier. Should the Blue Samurai down Croatia, they will become only the second Asian nation to reach the quarter-finals after South Korea in 2002. .For 44-year-old Japanese fan Takuro Shinmyozu, the player who has made a difference in Moriyasu’s charges is Ritsu Doan. The SC Freiburg winger has scored twice, his goals helping Japan beat Germany and Spain. .While Shinmyozu has been happy with the performances of Doan, dubbed by some as “the Japanese Messi”, he does feel that the 24-year-old needs to improve his behaviour. .“Doan is the best player. He knows what Japan should do. He may need to work on his attitude though,” said Shinmyozu who credits Japan’s disciplined strategy for having helped them overcome Germany and Spain. .“Higher-ranked teams like Germany and Spain have better individual skills and passing than Japan. Japan fended off their attacks and responded with well-organised strategies in the second half of those games,” he added. .Shinmyozu conceded that the team surprised him. He admitted he turned off his television and went to sleep when the team was trailing 1-0 against Germany in their World Cup opener but realised what he had missed out on when he woke up. .Yoichi Tominaga feels that the strong performances of the Samurai Blue in Qatar will serve the national team going well into the future. .He also noticed a change in the mentality of players who now “do not give strong nations respect” on the field as previous generations of Japanese footballers may have been doing to their own detriment. .“We have picked up confidence. We don’t give too much respect to strong nations any more. We are not afraid of them. There are many strong nations like Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Spain and France that we could still learn a lot from. Kids who are watching these games will not think that we are just an underdog. They will think that we can beat these teams. It gives the future of Japanese football a lot of meaning,” he said. .After witnessing the team make gradual improvement since its first World Cup appearance in 1998, longtime football fans such as Tominaga, 38, expected the group-stage games to be difficult but always knew that Japan would have a fighting chance of getting out of the group. .“I thought the group would be hard. I knew we would have a chance of advancing beyond the group stage as most football fans know that anything can happen in football,” said Tominaga.",212
213,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Brazil vs South Korea match preview: World Cup 2022 round of 16,Brazil will look to recover from their upset loss to Cameroon as they take on a South Korea brimming with confidence.,".Who: Brazil vs South Korea .Where: Stadium 974 .When: December 5, 10pm (19:00 GMT) .Brazil head into Monday’s World Cup last-16 tie against South Korea preoccupied with the health of the great Pele and with coach Tite wondering whether to recall the Selecao Canarinho’s current number 10 Neymar after an ankle injury kept him out of the last two matches. .Tite used his news conference before Friday’s final group game against Cameroon to wish Pele a speedy recovery after the all-time great was admitted to hospital in Sao Paulo during the week. .The three-time World Cup winner, now aged 82, has been undergoing a “re-evaluation” of the chemotherapy he had following surgery to remove a colon tumour in September last year. .Brazil fans also unfurled a banner with a “get well soon” message for Pele before the Cameroon game, which the Selecao lost 1-0, their first defeat at the group stage since 1998. .Brazil have a fearsome range of attacking options, even with Gabriel Jesus returning home injured, but they have scored just once since Neymar came off with a sprained ankle in their opening 2-0 win over Serbia on November 24. .“With his return, the whole team will improve,” said Richarlison, scorer of both goals against Serbia, on Friday. “I hope he comes back. Everyone saw how much we missed him in the last two games. I think him coming back will make me better.” .If Brazil win at Doha’s Stadium 974 they will advance to a quarter-final against Japan or Croatia, with a last-four showdown against great rivals Argentina still on the cards. .South Korea were the second lowest-ranked side to make the knockout stage but the Tottenham Hotspurs forward was clear that the Brazilians won’t be taking them lightly. .“They are an aggressive and strong team. We can’t afford to make mistakes,” warned Richarlison. .Still, the South Koreans will know that the odds are against them. Coach Paulo Bento’s side has recent experience of how chastening an experience it can be to take on Brazil. The teams met in a friendly in Seoul in June and Brazil romped to a 5-1 victory, with Neymar scoring two penalties. .But this has been a World Cup of upsets. Brazil, Belgium, Argentina and France – the world’s four top-ranked sides – have all lost to significantly less-fancied sides in the group stages of this tournament. Four-time winners Germany could not even make it to the knockouts. .The South Koreans have pulled off their own surprise win too: Their tournament looked to be over until substitute Hwang Hee-chan popped up in injury time to score the winner in a 2-1 victory over already qualified Portugal on Friday. .They will rely on talisman Son Heung-min to lead them against Brazil on Monday, after he ran himself into the ground on Friday to ensure his team reached the last 16. .“This is great but our tournament is not over,” said Son – who happens to be Richarlison’s Spurs teammate – following the emotions of the dramatic win over Portugal. .“We’ve always talked about reaching the round of 16 as our objective but we should now try to go beyond that,” Son, who shed tears of joy, told Korean media in Doha. .The South Koreans are the only Asian side to have reached the semi-finals before, when they were co-hosts with Japan in 2002. On Monday, they will be hoping to shock Brazil on their way towards making history again.",213
214,Published On 5 Dec 2022,Croatia vs Japan match preview: World Cup 2022 round of 16,"After beating two former champions, Japan will look to create further history. Croatia’s stars will have other ideas.",".Who: Croatia vs Japan .Where: Al Janoub Stadium .When: December 5, 6pm (15:00 GMT) .Japan’s sensational raids at the World Cup have already stunned Germany and Spain, but in the last 16 on Tuesday, they come up against a Croatia side that might just be a little too streetwise for a mugging. .Croatia have not shown the quality that got them to the final in 2018, but did what they needed to do to get through their group, only showing any signs of panic in their last match against a desperate Belgium. .Captain Luka Modrić, who with Ivan Perišić and Dejan Lovren forms a high-class but ageing core to the team, says they fear no one, and they will have done their homework on the Samurai Blue. .Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu might need to produce something new tactically for the clash at Al Janoub Stadium, having taken a similar approach to their first three games. .Inviting teams onto them for 45 minutes then switching to a more offensive formation and trying to snatch goals on the break worked perfectly against Spain and Germany, but was a bust in Japan’s loss to lowly Costa Rica. .Croatia, if anything, have patience and will happily stroke the ball around in front of the Japan defence probing for weaknesses without, perhaps, getting frustrated as Spain and Germany did. .They probably also have the technical smarts to make adjustments themselves when Moriyasu finally shows his hand with the switch to a back three and the introduction of pacy forwards like Kaoru Mitoma and Ritsu Dōan. .Moriyasu has won praise for his substitutions and tactical changes in Qatar. .Three of Japan’s four goals at the World Cup have been scored by players who started on the bench, and substitute Mitoma played the pass that set up the fourth. .Moriyasu has likened his men to baseball players, saying they all have roles to play including as “starters, relievers and closers”. The Japanese coach will have to make at least one change in his defence after Kou Itakura picked up a second yellow card against Spain, and injury clouds hang over his potential replacements Hiroki Sakai and Takehiro Tomiyasu. .Croatia, who mixed two 0-0 draws with a 4-1 thrashing of Canada in the group stage, have reached the last 16 twice before out of their five previous visits to the World Cup finals. They won both those games, reaching the semi-finals in 1998 and losing to France in the final in Russia four years ago. That’s a fine record for a country that only returned to international football in the early 1990s. .Asked about Croatia’s winning mentality, midfielder Lovro Majer said it was innate, but also down to older players like Modric, 37, offering years of experience to the team. .“We have a winning mentality in our blood,” said Majer on Saturday. “I think we have an excellent mix of experienced players who have done excellent things in their careers and younger players with new energy.” .Japan, by contrast, have played three last-16 matches in their five previous tournaments but lost them all. .Yet 2022 has already been different for them. Japan had never before beaten a former champion at the World Cup. This time, they’ve already beaten two. Charged with confidence after those breakthrough wins, Samurai Blue will certainly not stint in effort as they look to make a little more history for their country in Qatar.",214

It could be Croatian skipper and Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric’s final game of his career if the small but mighty Adriatic nation cannot overpower an unpredictable Japan. .The two teams have played each other twice at the World Cup. Croatia slipped past Japan 1-0 in the group stages of the 1998 World Cup; they later drew in 2006. .Speaking of upsets, South Korea, a tournament wildcard and hot off a dazzling 2-1 win over Portugal, head into their first knockout-round appearance in 12 years with their backs against the wall as they attempt to sink five-time World Cup champions Brazil. .  .Everything, however, is at stake for the top-ranked Brazilian side who coasted into the last 16 with wins over Serbia and Switzerland. .Brazil will have a boost of firepower from Neymar, who was sidelined for two games after sustaining an ankle injury against Serbia; the team struggled without him in their 1-0 loss to Cameroon. .Neymar practised with the team in Qatar on Saturday and Sunday. .Monday’s game at Stadium 974 will be the first World Cup contest between the two sides though Brazil have bested the Taeguk Warriors in six of seven friendly matches — their most recent coming during a 5-1 victory in June. .",215
216,Published On 5 Dec 2022,England’s Raheem Sterling back to UK amid home intrusion reports,The England player is said to be concerned about the wellbeing of his family as UK media reported a home robbery.,".England’s Raheem Sterling is leaving the World Cup tournament in Qatar and returning to the United Kingdom to be with his family amid media reports that intruders had entered his home. .The 27-year-old forward, who has 81 caps for England, was left out of the squad on Sunday night in the match against Senegal that saw England win 3-0 and book a place in the World Cup quarter-finals against France. .Sterling is said to have been shaken and concerned about the wellbeing of his children after “armed intruders broke into his home while his family were inside”, the UK’s PA news agency reported on Monday. .“I’ve spent some time with him today. He’s going to fly home. And obviously, family at these moments is the most important thing,” England coach Gareth Southgate told reporters on Sunday night in Qatar when asked about reports of a home intrusion. .“So we want to give him that space. And we’ll see over the next few days how that all develops,” Southgate said. .“He’s on his way home and, yeah, we’re obviously mindful of him being allowed space and [having] privacy respected, so we don’t want to talk in too much detail,” he said. .The England coach did not provide details of the incident, saying it was a private matter for Sterling, and would not say whether he would return to the squad in Qatar. .England’s Football Association said Sterling was not available for the Senegal match for “personal reasons”, and the England team’s Twitter account said he was left off the side as he was “dealing with a family matter”. . .Support for the England international flooded in on social media, with former England player and TV presenter Gary Lineker saying that he was thinking of Sterling and his family “after their awful and harrowing ordeal”. . .It was unclear whether Sterling will rejoin the England team in Qatar. .“Obviously it’s not ideal for the group preparing for a game, but the individual is more important than the group in those moments,” Southgate told reporters. .England captain Harry Kane, who scored the second goal of the game against Senegal, said the team wished Sterling their best and hoped to see him again “as soon as possible”. .“It’s never easy to see one of your teammates and friends have to deal with something like that,” Kane said. .“So we’ll have to take it day-by-day, I’m sure Raheem will talk to the manager and take the best decision for him and his family, that’s the most important thing,” he said. .“From us as a team we send him our best and hope to see him as soon as possible.”",216

His goal against Poland in the 44th minute — just one minute short of half-time — put Giroud’s total one ahead of the 51-goal record held by France’s Thierry Henry. .Giroud’s tally of goals could have gone one more after his shot found the Polish net again in the 57th minute, but it was disallowed as the game had already been stopped due to a collision between Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and France’s Raphael Varane. .Kylian Mbappe, who got the other two goals in the game on Sunday evening, also set a record by beating Pele’s total of seven World Cup goals before the age of 24. The 23-year-old Mbappe now has 33 goals in 63 appearances since making his debut for France in 2017. .Mbappe scored his first goal in the 74th minute and added his second when he curled a shot into the top corner one minute into injury time. .Poland also put a goal away in stoppage time from a Robert Lewandowski penalty shot, but it was far too late for a comeback. .French coach Didier Deschamps said after the match: “France needed a great Kylian Mbappe tonight and they got one.” .Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz had words of consolation for his team. .“We did our homework and got through the group stage. We didn’t manage that for 36 years. But then, unfortunately, we met the world champions,” he said. .France will now meet England, who advanced 3-0 against Senegal later on Sunday. .England have won both previous encounters with France at the World Cup: 2-0 in 1966, and 3-1 in 1982. .England overcame African champions Senegal on Sunday night with goals scored by Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka for a 3-0 win. .Henderson’s opening goal came in the 38th minute and was added to by Kane’s goal — his first in this tournament —  just before the half-time whistle was blown. Saka made it three goals for England in the 65th minute. .Though England’s win looked comfortable, Senegal did pose a threat in the first half when Ismaila Sarr beat England’s goalkeeper but then fired the ball over the goalmouth. Sarr also assisted in Senegal’s first strike on goal when he played the ball to teammate Boulaye Dia, whose shot forced England’s goalkeeper into a left-handed save. .England’s performance in the second half was commanding for a team chasing a World Cup dream to add to their 1966 championship victory. Notable was the absence of England forward Raheem Sterling, who was not available for selection on Sunday for what was reported to be a family issue. .Senegal coach Aliou Cisse later spoke of defensive lapses by his team and how African football would continue to progress. .“Our strength has always been defence, we don’t often concede goals, and certainly not three in a match. That was a surprise for me because defence is usually where we can make the difference,” he said. .“After the first goal it was tough for us and then we let the second in just before half-time. The third was key,” he said. .Cisse said football in Africa was “improving all the time”. .“You don’t win the World Cup overnight. We see that African infrastructure is improving and the federations are training coaches. We need more technical directors, improved refereeing, but our countries are working on these improvements. It cannot be done overnight,” he said. .“Mistakes have been made in the past but Africa now has the right policies in place. We cannot stop now if we want to win this tournament one day.”",217

It also took the captain beyond Gary Lineker’s record as England’s top scorer in major tournaments with 11 goals. .England were fortunate not to concede early in the game, with Senegal having two good chances before Henderson’s opener. The first big chance fell to Sarr, who beat goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to the ball but blazed it over the goalmouth. .Sarr was also instrumental in Senegal’s first shot on target, as the forward played it into Boulaye Dia, who struck intently at goal, forcing Pickford into a left-handed save. .The first half-hour was tight and edgy, but England found their feet and, following Henderson’s goal, developed their game into a commanding performance in the second half, looking more like a team chasing their first major title since winning the World Cup before a home crowd in 1966. .Jude Bellingham, aged 19, and 21-year-old Saka both played key roles throughout the game. .“We’ve got some super young players, and we feel it is right to give them an opportunity,” said Southgate. “They’re heading in the right direction, and these games are brilliant life experience for them.” .England’s 12 goals at this tournament equal their previous best at a World Cup when they reached the semi-finals of Russia 2018. In 1966, they scored 11, including four in the final against West Germany. .For Senegal, meanwhile, the result marked the end of a successful 2022 run that saw them become Africa Cup of Nations champions and reach the top 16 of the World Cup. .England’s next match comes against defending world champions France on Saturday, also at Al Bayt Stadium. .In their Round of 16 match against Poland on Sunday, France’s number 10 Kylian Mbappe, aged 23, scored twice to match 35-year-old Argentina great Lionel Messi’s nine-goal tally in World Cup competition.",219

His experience mattered when he made a superb quick save to deny Piotr Zielinski. .Poland’s poise came close to being rewarded in the 38th minute when onrushing Zielinski’s shot was parried by Lloris. The ball then came back into the midfielder’s path, but his second attempt was deflected by Theo Hernandez. .Jakub Kaminski followed, only for his shot to be saved close to the goal line by Raphael Varane. .One minute from the break, however, France’s tactics paid off. .Mbappe drew the defence to him and slid the ball through into the path of Giroud, who grabbed the inch of space he needed to clip the ball past Szczesny and net his third goal of the tournament. .The 36-year-old Giroud, who did not score in Russia four years ago, had drawn level with Thierry Henry on 51 goals after netting a double in the defending champions’ 4-1 win over Australia in their opening Group D game. .Mbappe made it 2-0 with a powerful, rising shot that went under the bar before he curled another jaw-dropping shot into the top corner one minute into injury time. .They were his fourth and fifth goals in Qatar, and Mbappe became the first player to score nine World Cup goals before his 24th birthday, having already netted as many as Argentina’s 35-year-old Lionel Messi. Mbappe could still play in two more World Cups by the time he’s 32. .It helped Mbappe to erase painful memories from last year’s European championship when he missed the decisive penalty that sent Switzerland into the last eight after a shootout following a 3-3 draw. .A handball by Dayot Upamecano gave Lewandowski a chance to score a consolation goal with a penalty that was first saved by Lloris before being retaken – and scored – because the keeper did not have his feet on the line .France will play in in the quarter-finals against the winner of Sunday night’s clash between England and Senegal. .Coach Didier Deschamps had warned that there was more to Poland than Lewandowski, and he was proved right as the French were at times shaky at the back. .“It’s not been easy because they’re a well-organised team and we had to make some positional changes at half-time,” Deschamps said. .“We’re a united squad, and tonight the players’ impeccable behaviour has been rewarded,” he said. “Now we’re going to spend a little bit of time with our families.”",221

223,Published On 4 Dec 2022,"World Cup 2022 has a winner, say women football fans: safety","From Brazil to Colombia, Ethiopia to Saudi Arabia, female fans say they’re enjoying late-night games, safe and secure.",".Doha, Qatar – When Andrea M set off from New York to follow Team USA’s journey at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, she reassured her friends and family that she would not do anything risky during the tournament. .What she had read about Qatar painted an alarming picture of the host country. .“The US media’s portrayal of the Middle East has been very different from what I have experienced here,” Andrea, 29, told Al Jazeera, adding that her friends decided against travelling to Qatar. .Andrea said she is glad she came. “Simple things like taking a walk around the city late at night, that’s something I can’t do back home.” .A 10pm (19:00 GMT) kickoff time for many of the group stage matches and knockout games mean that fans exit stadiums, use public transport and celebrate in fan zones well past midnight. And women, in groups or on their own, are watching football at public screenings, singing and dancing with other fans and moving around without worrying about their safety. According to the Numbeo Crime Index, Doha routinely ranks as the safest – or the second-safest – city in the world. .For Joy Nkuna, the experience has been a stark contrast to her home country South Africa, which ranks as among the most dangerous countries for women travellers. “We have very high crime rates in my country, especially against women,” she said. According to recent government figures, more than 1,000 women were murdered in South Africa in a three-month period between the start of July and the end of September. .Nkuna, 39, said she doesn’t venture out alone past sunset in her country. “From the minute it gets dark, women can’t be out alone or they will be in danger,” she said. “Here, me and my daughter walked around at 3am and nobody intimidated us, catcalled us or looked at us in a way that would make us feel unsafe.” .It’s an experience that Tatiana Lopez can relate to. Thirty-three-year-old Brazil fan Lopez, who has travelled from Colombia with two female friends, said men in public places have been very courteous. “While it is strange to see more men in public places (compared to women) than I’m used to seeing in Colombia, they have all been very respectful.” .Lopez said she has been enjoying the tournament without worrying about her belongings, which is something she’s not used to back home. “I can actually carry my backpack on my back, and keep my phone in my pocket because I know nobody will snatch it from me.” .Women who have been living in Qatar said safety is not a new phenomenon linked to the World Cup. .Khadija Suleiman, a 32-year-old Ethiopian who has been living in Qatar for 10 years, was at the Lusail Stadium for a 10pm kickoff recently with her three children and two nieces. “I don’t feel the need to be with a man in order to feel safe,” she said as she walked towards the stadium. .To be sure, security presence has increased in Qatar because of the World Cup. But Suleiman said that women’s and children’s safety in public places has never been a concern for her while in the country. “If I need to, I can send my children to school in a taxi and not worry about their safety.” .That confidence is shared by women from other parts of the Gulf region, many of whom have been able to participate in the Middle East’s biggest-ever sporting extravaganza without fear. .Dalia Abushullaih has travelled to Qatar from Saudi Arabia and said she is overjoyed to see women celebrating in public spaces. “Qatar has made sure that women feel safe and comfortable in being an active part of the tournament and enjoy freely,” the 29-year-old said. “The world is finally witnessing our beautiful Arab culture, and it is beautiful to see people taking it all in and going back home with a part of it.” .Apart from the stadiums, women and children have thronged tourist areas such as Doha’s Souq Waqif and fan zones spread all over the city. Some arrive during the day as festivities are getting started, while others push through the crowds with strollers to join the post-match celebrations. .The decision by organisers to ban alcohol sales in or near the match venues has also added to the confidence of many women that attending games won’t compromise their safety. .Camilla Ferrierra, a tournament volunteer from Brazil, said knowing that she won’t be surrounded by drunk fans at the stadiums made her feel safer. .“I could never imagine going to a football match alone [in Brazil],” she told Al Jazeera. “I can’t imagine being outside late at night, using my phone in public without fear and just being able to enjoy a walk or a football match. Here, I feel 100 percent safe and that’s a great thing for us women: to be able to enjoy the festivities and football in a safe and secure manner.” .Hanoof Abdullah, a Kuwaiti football fan, sat by herself in the middle of thousands of Brazilian fans at the Lusail Stadium. She said Arab families would have found it difficult to stay out at night if they knew alcohol was being served. .“Qatar has shown the world that football can be enjoyed without alcohol, and women can enjoy it without fearing for their safety,” she said. “The bar has been set very high, and now the world will have to work very hard to match it.”",223

When: December 4, 10pm (19:00 GMT) .The prospect of Harry Kane not scoring in any of England’s group games at the World Cup might have left fans fearing the worst but instead, there is a growing sense of optimism as Gareth Southgate’s side eyes Sunday’s last-16 clash with Senegal. .Kane, whose 51 goals for his country puts him only two behind record holder Wayne Rooney, has yet to fully hit his straps in Qatar, barely having a shot on target. .A foot knock sustained in the opening win against Iran has not helped the England skipper, who top-scored in the 2018 World Cup with six, but his lack of goals has certainly not impeded England’s smooth progress to the knockout rounds. .In fact, Kane’s failure to hit the net can be flipped to a positive. .England have still managed to score a tournament-coleading nine goals with their other forwards stepping up to the mark, none more so than Manchester United’s rejuvenated Marcus Rashford with three goals already. .Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka have also been among the goals, leaving Southgate a pleasant selection dilemma ahead of Senegal, although it is inconceivable he would not start with Kane in his forward three. .Compared with the white-knuckle rides experienced by some of the other favourites here, England sauntered through their group. But now, says Southgate, the serious business begins. .Senegal were crowned African champions earlier this year, and although they are playing in the World Cup without injured talisman Sadio Mane, the Lions of Teranga are a powerful side packed with experience and devoted to coach Aliou Cisse. .Senegal reached the World Cup knockout stages for only the second time after a dramatic 2-1 win against Ecuador secured the runners-up spot in Group A. .England are favoured to progress to the quarter-finals, but Senegal assistant coach Regis  Bogaert believes other surprise results at this year’s World Cup can inspire his team. .“The message is a strong one,” he said. “We’ve seen Cameroon beat Brazil and Tunisia beat France, so we know Senegal can beat England. That’s what we’re aiming for. That’s an important message.” .If Senegal are to pull off the shock, they might have to do it without their inspirational leader and coach Aliou Cisse, who has been sidelined with an illness. .Adding to the challenge, the African champions will definitely be without their midfield general Idrissa Gueye, who is suspended for the match having picked up a second yellow card against Ecuador in their final group match.",226

When: December 4, 6pm (15:00 GMT) .France will start their World Cup last-16 clash as overwhelming favourites but Poland are well equipped to derail Les Bleus’ title defence at Al Thumama Stadium. .France qualified for the knockout phase with a game to spare after two stylish performances against Australia and Denmark but lost the final group match to Tunisia after resting several key players. .Poland went through despite a 2-0 loss to Argentina in their final group game, carried through the opening phase by their sturdy defence and the touch of striker Robert Lewandowski. .France will enter the contest with most of their top players having recharged their batteries but patience, more than energy, might be key against Poland. .“They have experienced players. Obviously, Lewandowski is the stand-out player, one of the best strikers in the world,” said coach Didier Deschamps. “We should not underestimate them.” .France often struggle against compact sides who defend deep, such as Poland, but Deschamps has the tools to crack a game wide open. .While Kylian Mbappe, who is chasing records in Qatar after already scoring seven World Cup goals before the age of 24, might find it hard to use his devastating pace against a packed defence, Ousmane Dembele could be France’s main weapon. .The forward’s relentless dribbling, surging one way before jinking another, could be tough to handle for the Poles, who will also need to keep an eye on Olivier Giroud in the box. .Poland, meanwhile, have moved to the knockout stages for the first time in 36 years after finishing second in their group behind Argentina. .Poland have been resolute at the back, having conceded just twice in the tournament. A lot of that is down to the heroics of their keeper Wojcieh Szczesny, who has arguably been their best player so far. He is the only goalkeeper this World Cup to have saved penalty kicks, including one by Lionel Messi. .But for all of Poland’s defensive resolve, they have been far from prolific in front of goal and have scored just twice this World Cup, both goals coming against Saudi Arabia. But Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz bristled at the criticism his side’s conservative approach has received. .“The ones that weren’t playing defensively at the World Cup are back home watching on TV. Now we’re out of the group phase, so we will change our plans,” Michniewicz said ahead of Sunday’s game against France. .“Our luggage is not packed, we weren’t ready to go home before playing Argentina and we’re not ready to go home now,” he added. .The winner of Sunday’s match will face either England or Senegal in the quarter-finals.",227

Pele, who sustained swelling and cardiac issues after his hospital admission this week, was specifically diagnosed with bronchopneumonia, ESPN Brasil previously reported. .Pele’s daughter, Kely Nascimento, told the outlet her father had initially been hospitalised to regulate his medication related to his oncology treatments. .In a report on Saturday, medical staff at the Albert Einstein Hospital said Pele responded well to treatment for a respiratory infection diagnosed after his hospitalisation and that his condition had not worsened in the last 24 hours. .“He is still undergoing treatment and remains in stable condition,” his doctors said. .Pele’s latest statement on his health came hours after the daily Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported the retired footballer, who is battling cancer, is now receiving palliative — or “end of life” — care after his body stopped responding to chemotherapy following a surgery to remove a suspected colon tumour last year. .The football star previously posted on social media on Thursday reassuring followers that he had been at the medical facility for a “monthly visit”. .Pele, one of the most talented footballers to ever play the game, led Brazil to a trio of World Cup titles in 1958, 1962 and 1970.

In so doing, the Dutch have booked a place in a quarter-final showdown against Argentina. .Here’s a recap of all you need to know from Day 14 – Saturday, December 3 – of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar. .Argentina advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Cup 2022 with a 2-1 win over Australia. Argentina captain Lionel Messi marked his 1,000th game as a professional footballer by opening the scoring in the 35th minute. .Messi’s goal on Saturday night at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium in Qatar was his third at this year’s tournament and the ninth of his career in a World Cup, surpassing by one the previous record held by the late Argentinian footballing hero Diego Maradona. .Stubborn Australia had not given Argentina any space before Messi broke through their defences. Teammate Julián Álvarez put away the second goal against Australia in the 57th minute after a lapse by the Socceroos goalkeeper Mathew Ryan. .It was not all one way though, as Argentina felt the pressure when Australian substitute Craig Goodwin scored in the 77th minute following a deflection off Enzo Fernandez and into the Argentinian net. .A glimmer of hope emerged in the final seconds of the game that Australia’s Garang Kuol might send the teams into extra time with an equaliser, but his shot was stopped by Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martinez. .The knockout match against Argentina proved to be a game too far for Australia, who had already exceeded expectations by reaching the round of 16 for the second time ever. Australia lost in the last 16 in 2006 to the tournament’s eventual champions, Italy. .Looking forward, the Argentina vs Netherlands quarter-final showdown will be their sixth World Cup meeting, including Argentina winning the 1978 final 3-1, losing the 1998 quarter-final 2-1, and winning the 2014 semi-final 4-2 on penalties after a 0-0 deadlock. .“We had the game under control and could have scored another one… There were a few scary moments, but we made it through,” said Messi, who hopes to win the World Cup in his fifth and final attempt. .“It wasn’t easy but I am very happy that we are through. We have to play every three days but were looking forward to playing in front of our fans. We have to continue standing together as a team.” .Australia forward Mathew Leckie said: “It hurts. We came into the game to win. We had many chances and kept ourselves in the game. We saw that we are competitive, have a good fighting and team spirit.” .Though the USA started strong in their match against the Netherlands, it did not take long before the Dutch got the measure of the Stars and Stripes and scored three goals that put them through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup. .US star forward Christian Pulisic missed a golden opportunity early on when, after just three minutes of match time, he found himself with nothing between him and the Netherlands’s net than their goalkeeper. .But Dutch goalie Andries Noppert, the tallest man at the World Cup, stuck out his left leg to stop a shock opener to the game. .The Netherlands’s Denzel Dumfries then led the counterattack on Saturday night by providing an assist to Memphis Depay, who found the back of the USA net in the 10th minute. The lively start was then replaced with a more languid passage of play as the Netherlands sat back, waiting for more counterattacking chances. .A low pass from Dumfries to Daley Blind also set up the second Dutch goal just ahead of the half-time break. .Haji Wright, brought on as a substitute in the second half by the USA, gave his team their first and only goal in the 76th minute. .But just five minutes later, it was Dumfries who again put the Netherlands two goals ahead when he scored in the 81st minute, with Daley Blind this time providing the assist. .The Dutch will now face off against Argentina in the quarter-finals, as the Argentinians beat Australia 2-1 on Saturday. .“That’s a very important win for us,” Dumfries said after the game. “We played a very good match, but I still think we can do better.” .USA coach Gregg Berhalter said: “It’s such a good group of guys, but we came up just a bit short today, but not for the lack of trying. I’m really proud of this group but bitterly disappointed.”",230

We wanted him to score more goals; he could have scored a hat-trick tonight. .“I feel very happy. Now it is time to celebrate,” Gomez said, before breaking into a chant with a friend. .On the other end, there was disappointment among Australia fans – but also pride. .“The team did well. You couldn’t have asked for more from our players, they gave everything,” Emanuel Sarkhosh, who travelled from Sydney for the game, told Al Jazeera. .“It was a good game. It wasn’t our day, that’s football. The players did better than we expected.” .Earlier, the Argentina fans bounced, swayed and twirled their scarves in joyous celebration after Messi gave Argentina the lead. He had sent a pass inside to the edge of the area and kept running, eventually receiving a layoff from Nicolas Otamendi to take one touch and stroke his finish through the long legs of Australia defender Harry Souttar, the tallest outfield player at the World Cup. .And when Alvarez added the second, it looked like Argentina was going to cruise to victory.

It’s a cumulative effect of games, and sometimes you don’t have the ideal recovery time on your hands,” Tite told a news conference on Friday. .“I don’t really know what to say other than that, mentally, the Cup is very demanding.

237,Published On 3 Dec 2022,"Vincent Aboubakar: Talker, scorer of historic goals, African icon",The Cameroonian captain and forward finally earned his stripes on the biggest stage.,".Vincent Aboubakar’s winner against Brazil on Friday seemed like a fulfillment of the Saudi Arabia-based striker’s potential at the perfect time. .He paid the price for ripping his shirt off in celebration by collecting a second yellow card and thus a red one, but nothing could dampen Aboubakar’s brilliant run at the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .“I was overjoyed with emotion because it’s always been my dream,” the 30-year-old said. “It’s a huge honour to score against Brazil. It’s unforgettable and will stay with me forever.” .His excitement was understandable. Despite a group stage exit, Cameroon had become the first team to beat the five-time champions in the World Cup group stage since Norway at the 1998 edition in France — ending an unbeaten run of 17 group matches. .The win was also the first time an African nation would beat five-time champions Brazil at a World Cup. .On Monday, Aboubakar had come off the bench to score one goal and set up another as the Indomitable Lions rescued a vital point in a 3-3 draw with Serbia that ended a run of eight successive World Cup losses for the Central Africans. .The Al-Nassr man then powered a header past Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson in second-half stoppage time to give Cameroon their first win at the tournament since beating Saudi Arabia in 2002. .Born in the dusty northern cotton town of Garoua, 900km (560 miles) from the capital, Yaounde, Aboubakar started his professional career with local side Coton Sport. .He caught the eye as an 18-year-old when he was named the only home-based player in the Cameroon squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. .Aboubakar made a substitute appearance in the final group game against Denmark, but it was his impressive form on the domestic scene that earned him a move to French club Valenciennes after the global tournament. .At the 2014 summer event, he made two starts but was unable to find the net for a team that was in disarray, beset by off-field problems and indiscipline on the pitch. .Three fairly quiet seasons somewhat stalled his career before his switch to rivals Lorient in July 2013, where he delivered 17 goals in 37 matches. .Despite attracting interests from the English Premier League, it was Portuguese giants Porto who snapped up the Cameroonian in August 2014 following his solitary campaign at Lorient. .Aboubakar had a mixed six-year spell at Porto, scoring 58 goals and winning two league titles in a stint blighted by injury, as well as finding success on loan at Turkish side Besiktas in between. .He returned to Besiktas after terminating his contract with Porto in 2020, landing another domestic trophy before switching to Al-Nassr in July 2021. .From one legend to another .For Aboubakar, his performance in Qatar completed a scoring cycle that started on a high at the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) on home soil. .He starred in the final of the 2017 AFCON, netting Cameroon’s second goal to seal a 2-1 win over Egypt and a fifth continental title for the Indomitable Lions. .In this year’s tournament, he scored eight goals, the best tally since 1998 when Benni McCarthy (South Africa) and Hossam Hassan (Egypt) got seven apiece. Only Ndaye Mulamba, who notched 9 goals in 1974 for the country then known as Zaire, today’s Democratic Republic of the Congo, has more. .Following Aboubakar’s feat, Cameroon legend and 1990 World Cup star Roger Milla quickly tipped him to become one of Africa’s greatest-ever players. .“Aboubakar could be one of the greatest African footballers. He has all the attributes to be great and consistent,” Milla said in February. “Scoring goals and winning games for Cameroon is always possible when you have a healthy Aboubakar playing.” .Controversy  .Utilising his imposing frame, speed, strength, ability on the ball and clinical finishing to great effect, he stole the headlines on and off the pitch at the delayed AFCON this year. .He faced a barrage of criticism in the build-up to the semi-final against Egypt by taking a swipe at Mohamed Salah, claiming the Liverpool player is not on the same level as footballers such as Kylian Mbappe, of Paris Saint-Germain. .His comments infuriated many in North Africa and England. .Barely two weeks before the start of the tournament in Qatar, Aboubakar had another go at the Egyptian again, claiming the only difference between him and Salah is that the Liverpool player has the chance to “play in a big club”. .He told 90FootballFr: “I’m not impressed by him. I can do what he does. I just don’t have the opportunity to play in a big club.” .“I understand people’s attitudes, he’s one of the best goalscorers in the Premier League. It makes sense that when you go on about a player like that, people will talk.” .“But I did say that it was my opinion, my point of view. I don’t give a toss if people don’t like it.” .His comments may not have won him many admirers in November, but Aboubakar is certainly the African footballer of the moment on social media after helping Cameroon stun Brazil in Lusail. Some may be wishing that he has the chance to play at a big club soon, for more heroics.",237

This list includes Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema and Senegal’s Sadio Mane, who has now undergone surgery. .The group stages also saw their fair share of injury scares, but these updates have often been drowned out by the hectic four-match per day schedule football fans have been treated to over the past couple of weeks. .Here are some of the big-name players who have played at the tournament but are now in doubt for the knockout stages: .Brazil’s star player was fouled nine times during the team’s 2-0 opening win over Serbia.

Anyone who thinks the match against Australia will be easy is wrong,” Argentina’s Scaloni said. .His side will again be roared on by an enormous following as Argentines show themselves to be easily the loudest and possibly the largest fan base in Qatar. .Argentine striker Angel Di Maria was taken off as a precaution in their last game against Poland but should be fit to play alongside Messi again, though Scaloni has plenty of options to throw against the Australians. .Reaching the quarter-finals would be a dream for Australia, but for Argentina, it is a bare minimum national expectation as they seek a third World Cup trophy. .Messi, on his fifth and final quest to win the World Cup and match his great predecessor Diego Maradona in the number 10 shirt, is enjoying harmony with fans like never before and will be relishing the chance to delight them further against Australia",242

FIFA ranking: Netherlands (8), USA (16) .The first match of the World Cup’s knockout phase will pit the Netherlands against the USA at the Khalifa International Stadium on Saturday, with the European side seeking to affirm their credentials as serious challengers in Qatar. .There has been much talk – mostly from the Dutch camp – of the team’s potential to go all the way in the tournament. .Louis van Gaal’s side topped Group A, picking up seven points with 2-0 wins over Senegal and Qatar to go alongside a 1-1 draw against Ecuador. .But despite going unbeaten, the Netherlands’ three performances so far left plenty to be desired with a number of key players yet to fully fire and the side heavily reliant on goals from the in-form Cody Gakpo. .That will offer hope to the Americans, who will be the underdogs but have already offered up some proof of their own potential in an unbeaten run in Group B which saw them secure 0-0 and 1-1 draws against England and Wales respectively and a gritty 1-0 win over Iran to ensure their progress. .While the USA sweat on the fitness of star player Christian Pulisic – he has a pelvic injury and is being assessed daily – coach Gregg Berhalter said his team would have no inferiority complex. .“It’s a great opportunity, but it’s not something that we’re going into it thinking is an honour,” Berhalter said. “We deserve to be in the position we’re in. And we want to keep going. We don’t want to be going home on Saturday. .“And from here anything can happen. All we need to do is play one game at a time. There’s no need to even project how far this team can go,” added Berhalter, who has an intimate knowledge of Dutch football. The 49-year-old played in the Dutch league for three different clubs between 1996 and 2000. .For the Netherlands, the key will be to get Memphis Depay flying in attack and Frenkie de Jong on the ball in midfield. .Van Gaal has described them both as indispensable to the Dutch cause. .Depay says he is over his hamstring injury, having made two substitute appearances and started their last group game. .“I have drawn a line under the questions about fitness,” he told reporters. .“I’m fit. The knockout phase is serious business. We are past the group phase, we can now not afford to slip into it. Many people thought it would be a piece of cake, but it is always a bit different.” .Van Gaal, 71, was keen not to underestimate the opposition. .“I know from experience that matches against countries such as the United States and Australia, who we encountered at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, are always very difficult,” he said. “They are very fanatical and sharp on the ball.” .The winner of the match will advance to a quarter-final meeting with either Argentina or Australia on December 9.",243

The Chelsea winger’s absence would be a critical setback to the US lineup, the youngest team on average in Qatar, who have not advanced beyond the quarter-finals in 90 years. .“I’m taking it day-by-day for now and I will do everything in my power to work with this medical team and make sure I can play,” Pulisic, 24, said at training camp with the US squad on Thursday. .The Netherlands will look to superstar Cody Gakpo, who has scored three times in Qatar, as well as striker Memphis Depay to repel a young and crafty US squad. .Argentina, rebounding from an opening defeat against Saudi Arabia and having jetted past Mexico and Poland to top Group C, are heavily favoured against Australia. The Argentinians are ranked 35 points ahead of the Socceroos. .Notably, captain Lionel Messi’s career hangs in the balance on Saturday. For Messi, who has netted two goals in Qatar but has yet to win a World Cup, Saturday’s match could be his last World Cup game if Argentina tanks, spelling the end of an illustrious career. .Argentina winger Angel Di Maria, who was taken off the field during Argentina’s win over Poland, will likely start but it is not yet confirmed. .“We will break our backs on this pitch to compete, we know how difficult this World Cup is, this is football,” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said on Friday. .Australia, Group D runners-up, playing in their first knockout round, cruised into the last 16 with 1-0 wins over Denmark and Tunisia, despite a crushing 4-1 loss to France.",244

Kim Younggwon brought his team back with an equaliser in the 27th minute and it was a 90th-minute shot by Hwang Heechan that sent the South Koreans on to the next stage of the tournament. .Even after their 2-1 victory and the final whistle was blown, there were eight agonising minutes before South Korea were officially informed they had made it through after Uruguay’s 2-0 victory over Ghana was not enough to usurp the South Koreans on goal difference. .When the result of the Uruguay-Ghana game was known and South Koreans were sure of their second-place finish, the players on the pitch erupted in joy, hugging each other and squirting water in the air. .“It really feels like a miracle,” South Korea striker Cho Guesung said after the match. .Though Uruguay solidly beat Ghana 2-0, it was not enough to keep from ending their World Cup dreams after qualification for the next round of the tournament came down to goals scored and South Korea had pulled off a 2-1 win against Portugal in the group’s other game. .Uruguay captain Luis Suarez could not watch as his team slid towards their painful World Cup exit on Friday. He put his hands in front of his eyes, then pulled his shirt over his head. When his face emerged again, there were tears. .When Suarez was substituted out in the 66th minute of the game, Uruguay was in a position to advance to the knockout stage for a fourth straight World Cup. .Suarez had played key roles in both Uruguay goals by Giorgian De Arrascaeta, which came after Ghana captain Andre Ayew missed a 21st-minute penalty. A shot by Suarez led to De Arrascaeta’s opener in the 26th minute. Suarez then set up the second with a clever pass that De Arrascaeta volleyed in six minutes later. .By the time the final whistle blew, Uruguay’s 2-0 had clinched the game against Ghana but cruel fate would still see them sent home due to goal difference. .Though Uruguay were two goals up on Ghana and the winners in their final Group H match, it was the late goal scored by Hwang Heechan in South Korea’s 2-1 victory over Portugal that sealed Uruguay’s fate. .“It is sadness and disappointment that we feel,” said Suarez, who was playing in his last World Cup. “I was lucky enough to play my fourth World Cup and I was thinking about my four-year-old son, who is leaving with the image of sadness. It’s difficult, but it’s up to me to face the situation.” .  .Switzerland beat Serbia in a high-octane five-goal thriller that saw the Swiss advance to the Round of 16 after pulling off a 3-2 victory over the Serbs. .In a contest that hit breakneck speed in the first half at Stadium 974, Xherdan Shaqiri put Switzerland ahead but Serbia swiftly responded and scored twice within 10 minutes through Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic. .Switzerland’s Breel Embolo then delivered another twist in an absorbing opening period by pulling his team level 2-2 just before the break, while teammate Remo Freuler scored three minutes after the second-half restart to restore their one-goal advantage and the final score in the 3-2 match. .The fast-paced game also saw tension spill out on the pitch when Mitrovic went down after a challenge from Fabian Schar.

It is so satisfying. I’m very happy. We finally beat Brazil,” John Epanty, who is from Cameroon, told Al Jazeera after the match. .“Brazil is one of the best teams in the world. If you’re looking for a consolation win, you want this victory,” he said. .Fellow Cameroonian Caleb Williams predicted celebrations would go on all night back in Cameroon. .“They are already drinking and will be till morning,” Williams said. “I mean, we took out Brazil, that’s huge,” he told Al Jazeera. .The winning goal from Vincent Aboubakar came in the closing 92nd minute of the game and apart from bringing victory, it also electrified supporters of the Indomitable Lions at Lusail Stadium who had likely expected the game to end in a draw. .After the match and though few in number, the Cameroon supporters made the very best of the special moment, singing the praise of their team while media cameras swarmed to record the aftermath of the historic win. Brazilian fans joined in the celebrations too, knowing they lost but had already qualified for the next stage which will see them face South Korea on December 5. .Still, the shock of Cameroon’s goal in the dying minutes of the game was too much for some Brazil supporters. .“I don’t feel so good,” Patricia Luze from Sao Paolo told Al Jazeera. .“I was not expecting that goal,” said Luze, who has tickets for the World Cup final and is hoping to see her team compete in that match. .“The final is here and I hope to be here again when we will, by God’s grace, raise the cup again,” she said. .Before kick-off on Friday, the contingent of Cameroonian fans at Lusail were clearly outnumbered by the thousands of Brazil fans who turned Lusail into a sea of yellow and green. .Brazil is seen by many as the greatest footballing nation in the world and the energy of their fans on Friday – decked out in T-shirts, scarves and waving flags – demonstrated how much they love their five-time World Cup winners. .The victory was “bittersweet”, said Samuel Ngassam from Douala in Cameroon. .“Yes, we beat Brazil. I am proud,” he said. .“But there are many lessons from this we must take,” Ngassam told Al Jazeera while a group of nearby Brazilian fans called him to join them for a short video. .Ngassam said the Cameroon team “should have shown more heart” and that, in their earlier games, it appeared as though they would have settled for draws. .Tonight, however, was not about qualifying for the next round of the World Cup, it was all about Brazil, he said. .“Today we beat Brazil. That’s all that matters,” he added. .“I’ll worry about everything else when I wake up.”",246

The midfielder fired home a strike that took a slight deflection off Strahinja Pavlovic on its way into the net. .Fulham frontman Mitrovic headed in Tadic’s cross to deservedly draw Serbia level six minutes later. Tadic was involved again and slipped the ball through to Vlahovic, who steered a low shot past goalkeeper Gregor Kobel to complete the Serbian turnaround. .But Embolo slotted home Silvan Widmer’s low cross in the 44th minute and Freuler kept the momentum going by thumping in the fifth goal of the evening, as two wonderfully worked moves from the Swiss attack proved to be Serbia’s undoing. .Midway through the second half, Mitrovic went down too easily after a challenge from Fabian Schar but his appeals for a penalty were turned down and the Serbian dugout spilt onto the pitch protesting the referee’s decision. .Switzerland finished with six points, level with Group G winners Brazil but behind on goal difference.

Referee Ismail Elfath smiled, shook Aboubakar’s hand, then showed him a yellow and a red card in quick succession. .Brazil had been far from their exuberant best throughout, seemingly happy to cruise through the game with a draw. .Having won their first two matches in Qatar, Brazil topped the group and advance to a last-16 tie against South Korea, when their many key players who were rested for this game will return. .Coach Tite sent out a second-string side and the result was Brazil’s first defeat in the group stage of a World Cup since 1998 when they were beaten by Norway. .Tite’s mind was on the knockout stage here as he made nine changes to the starting lineup, including handing a start to 39-year-old Dani Alves, making him Brazil’s oldest-ever men’s international player. .The spine of Brazil’s second-string side still featured Manchester City’s Ederson in goal, Real Madrid’s Eder Militao in central defence, Liverpool’s Fabinho in midfield and Arsenal’s Gabriel Jesus, supported by Rodrygo up front. .They also had the 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli on the left and the Arsenal prospect was their standout performer. .He almost scored the opening goal in the 14th minute when he leapt unmarked but saw his header tipped over by Cameroon goalkeeper Devis Epassy. Martinelli also threatened in first-half stoppage time with a dribble across the edge of the area and a shot Epassy turned behind. .It was a piece of play reminiscent of Neymar, who is still recovering from the sprained ankle that forced him off in the opening 2-0 win over Serbia but watched the action from just behind the Brazilian bench. .The Brazil fans – who unfurled a banner with a “Get Well Soon” message for legendary player Pele who is in hospital with a respiratory infection – cheered loudly when Neymar appeared on screens inside the enormous stadium. .Needing a win, Cameroon almost went in front in first-half stoppage time when a Bryan Mbeumo header faced a flying save from Ederson. .Martinelli was their most likely source of a goal, forcing Epassy to tip over another strike that was arcing towards the top corner early in the second half and the Cameroon shot-stopper – continuing in place of Andre Onana who was dropped for unspecified disciplinary reasons – turned a Militao shot around the post moments later. .Eager to study all his attacking options, Tite sent on the Flamengo duo of Everton Ribeiro and Pedro, but he also saw Alex Telles come off hurt in the second half. .Telles is the third Brazil full-back to succumb to injury at the tournament after Danilo and Alex Sandro. .At this rate, the veteran Alves will have a further role to play in Qatar. .Most importantly, Brazil will hope to have Neymar back soon but it remains to be seen if he will feature against South Korea on Monday. .Aboubakar grabbed the late winner just when a goalless draw looked the most likely outcome and Cameroon deserve huge credit for taking four points from such a difficult group even if they now go home. .In the other Group G match, Switzerland beat Serbia 3-2 to get second place and set up a clash against Portugal in the Round of 16.",249

[He] will remain in the hospital in the coming days to continue treatment.” .Pele, whose real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time. He is the only player to have won three World Cups, helping win the trophy for Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970. .But the former star has been contending with health issues, including continuing cancer treatments, for years, receding from public life as his condition becomes more fragile. .Pele had a tumour removed from his colon in September 2021. His most recent hospitalisation comes as part of “a reevaluation of the chemotherapeutic treatment of the tumor”, the Albert Einstein hospital said in a statement. .Pele’s daughter, Kely Nascimento, has sought to quell concerns about the hospitalisation, which came as teams completed in the 2022 World Cup, one of football’s biggest sporting events. .“Hi my friends. Lots of alarm in the media today concerning my dad’s health,” she wrote in a post on Wednesday to the social media platform Instagram, adding, “There is no emergency or new dire prediction.” .Fans and well-wishers have voiced their support for the football star, including many from Qatar where the World Cup is taking place.

260,Published On 2 Dec 2022,‘Here to play football’: German league boss on ‘OneLove’ band row,Germany’s football league chief executive Donata Hopfen believes the World Cup in Qatar will have a lasting effect on the sport.,".German football league (DFL) chief executive Donata Hopfen believes the World Cup in Qatar will have a lasting effect on the sport due to the many political debates that came with it. .“The World Cup will certainly change things, has changed things. It will draw attention to many topics that are important,” she told the dpa news agency on Thursday. .On the controversy surrounding the “OneLove” captain’s armband banned by football governing body FIFA, Hopfen said: “I think the discussion was right and at the same time we are here to play football. .“I am very happy that we are now focusing on the sport,” she added. .Hopfen said the World Cup 2022 is the biggest football tournament in the world, “and at the end of the day, we always have to remember that it is about sport – and sport must be at the centre of it”. .Earlier, a group of European nations, including Germany, were planning to use the armband as a sign of equality and diversity during the tournament in Qatar, a country where homosexuality is illegal. .But the teams backed down after FIFA threatened financial and sporting sanctions. .Ahead of their opening game against Japan, Germany’s players covered their mouths during a team photo in protest against FIFA’s threat to sanction players for wearing the “OneLove” armband. .Hopfen was in Doha to watch Germany’s last group stage match against Costa Rica on Thursday, which her country won 4-2. .But the win could not ensure the four-time world champions a slot in the knockout stage. .Germany began their final fixture against Costa Rica knowing a win would likely take them into the last 16 if Japan failed to beat Spain. .However, Japan staged a remarkable comeback to beat La Roja, ensuring they emerged as surprise group winners and ending Germany’s bid for a fifth World Cup triumph. .Germany’s fate was effectively decided when it lost its first game 2-1 to Japan, then followed up with a 1-1 draw with Spain. .With the exit, Germany have failed to progress beyond the group stage at consecutive World Cups after doing so on each of their previous 16 appearances at the tournament.",260
261,Published On 2 Dec 2022,"‘Relish this moment, forget about the war’: Yemenis on World Cup","For some in the Yemeni capital, the football event provides a welcome break from discussions about the continuing conflict.",".Sanaa, Yemen – In Maeen district in the heart of the Yemeni capital Sanaa, about 10 street vendors gathered on the side of a busy road to watch the Argentina-Saudi Arabia match. .The men, who make a living selling vegetables or black-market petrol, crowded around a laptop that one of the vendors had brought and placed on some cardboard on the ground. .As they watched the match in the shade of a building, some standing, others sitting – the odd passer-by stopping to catch parts of the game – the spectators temporarily forgot about their worries. The men jumped and shouted whenever a goal was scored. .When the match ended in a 2-1 victory to Saudi Arabia, the fans of the Saudi team cheered and cracked jokes about Argentina and Lionel Messi. The Argentina supporters were speechless. .“Football is unmatched fun,” said Abdulrahman Nasser, a Messi fan who looked to be in his thirties. “It is a recipe that can increase one’s joy and make its fans care less about their life problems.” .For many in Yemen, the World Cup has offered a welcome distraction and a different topic of conversation. .“Politics and war were the topics of our talks and gatherings,” explained 40-year-old self-employed taxi driver Fuad Qasem at a coffee shop in Sanaa where patrons had gathered to watch the tournament’s opening match between Qatar and Ecuador. “[But] today, the World Cup has displaced such a topic from our heads, and keeping updated on this event has been a priority,” he added. .An eight-year war has devastated Yemen, leaving thousands of people dead and triggering a humanitarian catastrophe. In October, the two warring sides failed to agree on an extension to a United Nations-brokered truce. .Despite the hardship brought on by the conflict, many Yemenis’ love for football has not wavered. .Gazing at the television screen with his cheeks full of qat, a narcotic leaf many Yemenis consume during social gatherings, Qasem told the four friends sitting with him, “Let us relish this moment and forget about the war. I parked my taxi, put work and money aside, and came to watch this event.” .Around him, the atmosphere grew rowdy as people vied for seats with a clear view of the screen, and sat down with their water, juice or Pepsi as they waited for the match to start. .Qasem excitedly checked the line-ups for both teams, reading out details to his friends about the players’ professional achievements. .Almost everyone in the coffee shop wanted Qatar to win. So when, 16 minutes into the game, Ecuador scored their first goal, many of those watching slapped their foreheads with their palms in frustration. .Qatar’s eventual 2-0 loss didn’t diminish the sense of awe and pride many of those gathered felt about an Arab country hosting the World Cup for the first time. .“This event is the talk of everyone, and Qatar is the one that dreamed of this moment years ago and turned the dream into reality,” Qasem said. .Mohammed Ali, a 23-year-old studying public relations at university in Sanaa, saw the tournament as a rare source of hope and entertainment. He believed Yemenis are fed up with talking about the country’s conflict as such conversations trigger fears about the future. .Ali’s friend Izadeen Madi, a 24-year-old studying English at an education college in Sanaa, likewise believed that always talking about the country’s war-related challenges such as the fuel shortages of previous months affects people’s psyches. “When negative news prevails, we see life as harder and sadder. This is what millions of Yemenis have sensed throughout the war,” he said. “Indeed, the World Cup matches are in Doha, but it has disrupted the murky atmosphere here.” .Mahdi said his favourite team is usually Brazil, who he expected to progress to the final rounds. But with a slight smile on his narrow face, he added that he hoped one of the four competing Arab countries would win. .This tournament, he believed, is a special moment for the Arab world. “I am a big fan of Brazilian football players. But when they face Arab teams, I encourage the latter. Whether it is Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or Morocco, I will support them against European or other international teams.” .Private coffee shops and the Ministry of Youth and Sports set up viewing screens in advance of the World Cup. .There are viewing spots in Sanaa football stadiums, and outdoor screens in 10 districts of Taiz, a city about 260km (161 miles) south of the capital. To the northeast of Sanaa, about 173km (107 miles) away, screens were organised in different neighbourhoods of Marib city, which has been a refuge for tens of thousands of internally displaced persons throughout the war. .Ammar Saleh, a 35-year-old primary school teacher in Sanaa, has been a passionate football fan since he was a child. .Yemenis are obsessed with football, according to Saleh, which explained why the World Cup was so popular. “If it is volleyball, tennis, or any other game, I would not care. And this stance applies to millions of Yemenis,” he said. .Saleh watched the first day of the tournament with his parents and siblings at home. “We tried to finish our tasks of the day before the start of the opening ceremony and the first match. It was a great time filled with joy and tension. In every match, we have a particular team to support, which is why it is tense.” .For him, an Arab team’s success in the World Cup is a triumph for all Arabs. In Saleh’s opinion, Arab countries may differ, but with so much in common – shared language and religion, for example – when one country achieves great things at the international level, all Arabs feel proud. .Saleh Abdulla, a 25-year-old grocery store employee in Sanaa, has been watching the matches on his mobile phone at work. “I am addicted to watching football games, especially the World Cup tournament,” Abdulla told Al Jazeera. .During the opening match, dressed in the traditional Yemeni outfit consisting of a robe, belt and jambia, a type of dagger, Abdulla sat in a chair with his phone on a desk in front of him in the store where people buy yoghurt, biscuits, cooking oil, chocolate and other items. .When a customer came in while he was watching the game, he stood up, politely brought them their items, took their money and swiftly returned to the game. Usually, Abdulla said his social media accounts are inundated with posts about the conflict. .“[Now,] when I browse social media platforms such as Facebook, I see almost all posts discussing the World Cup in Qatar,” he said. “So we got a break from war news in day-to-day conversation and on virtual social sites.” .Abdulla has been following the World Cup ever since 2002. For him, that was “the most amazing tournament”. .While many see this sporting event as an outlet for joy, others believe it shows great feats are possible. .“Hosting this event in Qatar is a considerable glory, and the second glory will happen if an Arab country wins the World Cup,” Madhi said. “That is why football fans in Yemen or other Arab countries are tense. They seek a double success: hosting and winning the World Cup 2022.” .For others, the tournament holds an important lesson. .Leila Amri, a 34-year-old university graduate in Sanaa, told Al Jazeera that Qatar did not accomplish the event preparations overnight. “It took years of hard work, cooperation, and perseverance,” she said. “This should remind all warring sides in Yemen that fighting and hatred will never bring peace or prosperity to our country.”",261

Thank you Japan! I love you guys!” said 19-year-old Yusei Sato, wearing Japan’s Samurai Blue national team jersey. .Takuya Kudo, 23, was in tears as soon as he saw Japan win. .“I’m just so happy,” he said. “Honestly, I never thought Japan would do this well. I’m just really thrilled.” .Fans lingering in Shibuya pressed high-fives on bleary commuters making their way to work from one of Tokyo’s busiest stations. .“I thought this game would be a bit tough,” said 36-year-old Munehiro Hashimoto, dressed in a Japan jersey, with blue and silver tinsel around his shoulders. .He had spared no effort with his outfit, topping it with a makeshift blue samurai helmet emblazoned with “must win” and “samurai spirit” on either side. .“It started at four in the morning (in Japan), so I was watching it at home. Then they won, so I rushed out here. We did it!” .Social media exploded with joy, with some fans posting manga-style drawings of a cheering player in a team uniform. .Another posted a cartoon of three dragons draped in national flags. The Japanese dragon was roaring while the Spanish dragon eyed Germany, which looked befuddled. .The sense of triumph rose even to Japan’s normally staid political heights, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida telling reporters the win was “historic” and telephoning Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu and Japan Football Association President Kozo Tashima to offer congratulations.",263
264,Published On 2 Dec 2022,Ghana eager to avenge 2010 Uruguay World Cup defeat,"Since Ghana’s controversial defeat to Uruguay at the 2010 World Cup, fans have been waiting for a rematch – and revenge.",".Accra, Ghana – Ghana and Uruguay meet in World Cup 2022 with an added importance for both sides. .While La Celeste, currently sitting bottom of the table, need a massive win to go through, a win or draw by the Black Stars will knock their opponents out of the 2022 World Cup. .For millions of Ghanaians – and other Africans – the latter outcome would be predestined fate because of a 12-year-old grudge from the last competitive meeting between the two sides, at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. .After a 1-1 draw between both sides, Ghana went on to lose 4-2 in a penalty shootout. But given the drama in the game, they felt aggrieved. .Fans are hoping that the Black Stars can take their pound of flesh, especially as veteran Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez, the chief antagonist in that game, is still involved for his side. .“I haven’t forgotten about that game,” Accra-based fan Enoch Kofi Boakye told Al Jazeera. “It hurt me in 2010 and even after all these years, it still hurts when I remember what Suarez did.” .Suarez himself has added flames to the fire by calling the match against Ghana a do-or-die one. “We are going to put our lives and soul in this last match,” he said earlier this week. .“Ghana is a good team but we know them, we have beaten them before and we know how to beat them again.” .Of the five African teams present – hosts South Africa included – when the continent first hosted the tournament in 2010, only the Black Stars went from the group stage, reaching the quarter-finals for the second time (the 2010 World Cup was the only time Ghana reached the quarter-finals) in their second appearance at the World Cup. .So, when they eventually tumbled against Uruguay, the mood across the continent deflated. .Ghana put in such good performances that they were starting to make people believe. Having qualified from a group that contained Germany, Serbia, and Australia, the Black Stars dispatched the USA in the round of 16. .That set up a date with Uruguay in the quarter-finals. In the first half, the team secured a lead following a 35-yard belter from Sulley Muntari. But that was as good as it got. .A well-drilled Uruguay restored parity after the break, thanks to Diego Forlan’s dipping free-kick, and they would go on to knock Ghana out of the tournament via penalties. .In all these, two names stole the headlines: star forward Asamoah Gyan for missing a penalty in the last minute of extra time that would have seen Ghana become the first African team to reach the last four of the World Cup, and Suarez, for preventing a goal-bound effort from striker Dominic Adiyiah in the 119th minute with his hand. .Even though Suarez was red-carded for that, his wild celebrations on the touchline when Gyan hit the crossbar from 12 yards made him a villain for millions of Ghanaians but a hero back in South America. .Ahead of Friday’s game, Suarez has also refused to apologise. .“The emotions from that night are still fresh. Honestly, it still hurts,” said Daniel Koranteng, a sports journalist with Accra-based Citi TV. “Ghanaians will never forget Suarez. It would’ve been easier to forgive had it been a tackle in the box. But the fact that he denied Ghana a clear goal-bound effort, effectively turning Asamoah Gyan into a villain, is something that can’t be forgiven.” .“It was like the five stages of grief,” football fan Francis Gbeddy told Al Jazeera. “The acceptance stage – to accept that we had just lost on such vicious terms – took very long to come.” .Gyan’s costly penalty miss continues to divide opinion among Ghanaians, some of whom are yet to forgive him. From time to time, the veteran striker receives criticism for failing to convert that penalty. In an interview with the BBC in August, Gyan said he let down his country and the whole continent. .“I wanted to score for my nation and for the whole of Africa,” Gyan said. “I couldn’t bury the ball and I feel I let everybody down. Sometimes I ask myself questions. [If people say they felt pain], what about me who was on the field and missed the penalty? How did I feel?” .“If I hadn’t shot that penalty [in the shootout], that would’ve been the end of my career because the first one was a mistake that happened and I wanted to redeem myself with the second one,” he added. “[That moment] Still haunts me. Sometimes I wish there’d be a second chance for me to vindicate myself.” .Fate seems to have now presented that second chance, the right moment to avenge what remains probably the most heartbreaking moment in modern football history for the West Africans. .Although the stakes are not as high as they were in South Africa, there is still no love lost between them. Both teams are paired in a tricky group that also contains Portugal and South Korea who are in first and third place in the group, respectively. .To reach the knockout rounds, Uruguay need to defeat Ghana and pray that South Korea do not triumph over Portugal. But even in the case of an upset by the Asians, Uruguay’s winning margin over Ghana has to be at least two goals more than that of the Taegeuk Warriors. .With the odds seemingly in favour of the Black Stars this time, many fans cannot wait for what they consider karma to happen to Suarez and company. .Theophilus Addy was only a teenager during the World Cup in South Africa, but cannot shake off his disappointment from that game. “Suarez and Uruguay deserve to feel exactly what we felt in 2010. Even if Ghana doesn’t qualify from the group, we must beat them,” he said. .Eliminating Uruguay at the group stages “will be justice”, Koranteng concurred. “Let’s make Suarez’s final memory at the World Cup a painful defeat at the hands of the team he stole so cruelly from.” .Some fans do not see a victory as adequate revenge given that the stakes are considerably lower here. But that does not matter to Boakye, who wants his country to have the last laugh and ensure that Suarez who faces near-certain retirement after this tournament, bows out on a sad note. .“I can’t even begin to imagine Ghana losing again,” he told Al Jazeera. “The GFA [Ghanaian Football Association] must show the players videos from the 2010 game and how Ghanaians cried. This is revenge time.” .“It’s good that Ghana will play them in the last group game,” Boakye added. “That way, we can beat them and also knock them out of the World Cup.” .",264

A win over Serbia would guarantee them a spot in the next stage, while a draw would also be enough unless Cameroon pull off an upset win against Brazil, which would mean goal difference would be a determining factor. .Serbia have a much tougher route to the knockout stage. They must beat Switzerland by a significant goal margin, and then pray for a very precise outcome from the Cameroon-Brazil game — a win for Cameroon but by a narrow margin so Serbia have a better goal difference than the African side. .Yet such permutations will not be the only source of tension when the Swiss and Serbs meet. They have played each other only once, in the group stage of the 2018 World Cup. That match remains etched in the memory of fans as one with heavy political undertones. .Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka, born in Basel to ethnic Albanian parents from Kosovo, celebrated his goal against Serbia by forming a double-headed eagle with his hands, an Albanian nationalist symbol that can be found on Albania’s flag. .Xherdan Shaqiri – born in Kosovo, which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008 – added another Swiss goal and replicated Xhaka’s celebration in the 2-1 group stage win, infuriating the Serbian side and prompting world football governing body FIFA to fine both players for unsporting behaviour. .Shaqiri, who did not play in Switzerland’s 0-1 loss to Brazil on Monday due to a muscle strain but is expected to return against Serbia, said in reference to the 2018 match that the Swiss were in Qatar to play football. Xhaka is also a key member of the Swiss team in Qatar. .Controversy over Kosovo has already shadowed Serbia at this World Cup, with FIFA opening proceedings against the nation’s football association after a flag which showed Kosovo as part of their country was allegedly hung in the dressing room when they faced Brazil. .The Football Federation of Kosovo, which became a member of European football’s governing body UEFA and FIFA in 2016, decried the “aggressive action” undertaken by Serbia. .When Switzerland and Serbia kick off on Friday, watch for goals. But also keep an eye out for the celebrations.",265

Uruguay would go on to win the subsequent penalty shootout and break Ghanian hearts in one of the cruellest exits in World Cup history. .This time La Celeste and the Black Stars meet in a group stage match, but once again, qualification to the next round for both teams rides on the match’s outcome. .Ghana head into the game with three points, having suffered an opening day 3-2 defeat to a star-studded Portugal but bounced back to beat South Korea by the same score in a thrilling end-to-end second match. .A win would guarantee Ghana a place in the round of 16 but a draw could suffice unless South Korea beats Portugal by two or more goals in their final group game. .Uruguay are in a worse position as they head into the match with a solitary point from their goalless draw with South Korea. Uruguay lost their second match 2-0 to Portugal, meaning they have yet to score in this tournament. .Scoring will be essential in their clash with Ghana because they must win if they are to stand any chance of qualifying. With Edison Cavani, Darwin Núñez and Luis Suarez all available, Uruguay should be able to end this goal drought. .Interestingly, like Ghana, Uruguay will be hoping that South Korea do not do too well against Portugal. If La Celeste do beat Ghana, they can qualify for the next round if South Korea loses or draws their last match. If both Uruguay and South Korea win, then goal difference, goals scored or fair play might determine who joins Portugal in the round of 16 from Group H. .While backroom experts will be following these equations, the players themselves will be looking to keep it simple: All they can do is score and win.",266

The Portuguese have the upper hand, having scored five goals in two matches and secured six points. They will guarantee their place at the top of this group by avoiding defeat. .South Korea head into their final game with a single point, earned during a cagey goalless draw with Uruguay in their opening match. They lost to Ghana 3-2 in a thrilling, high-octane second match. .In addition to beating Portugal, South Korea will need the group’s other match between Uruguay and Ghana to go their way. The South Koreans will need Uruguay to beat Ghana, but narrowly. .Uruguay and South Korea are currently level in the fair play table. If this remains the case and nothing – points, goal difference, goals scored or fair play – separates the teams, then a random draw will decide the qualification. .The South Korean players showed the high-quality football they are capable of in their game against Ghana, scoring two identical quickfire goals in the second half and almost staging a remarkable comeback.

Brazil, who have already qualified for the next round, are expected to rest many of their key players. Cameroon will also have been buoyed by their incredible comeback against Serbia which saw them score two quickfire goals to level the game after being 3-1 down. .Cameroon’s second against Serbia was arguably one of the tournament’s best goals so far. Vincent Aboubakar, who had been put through on goal, stepped inside, sending an onrushing defender flying and scooped the ball so high over the keeper that the cameraman had no time to adjust the angle, and the ball left the frame before crashing back down and into the net. .Despite the morale-boosting performance, they head into this match with only a point, having lost their opener by a single goal to a disciplined Switzerland team. Brazil have won both their games, scoring three and conceding no goals. .With Switzerland on three points, Cameroon’s best chance of reaching the last 16 is if they win and the group’s other match – between Switzerland and Serbia – ends in a draw. .If Switzerland do beat Serbia, they qualify along with Brazil, even if Cameroon win on Friday. .If both Serbia and Cameroon win by the same margin, then Brazil will top the group, and Cameroon will go through on goal difference. If qualification cannot be decided by goal difference, FIFA will look at goals scored and then fair play if all records are level. .Cameroon will be without Inter Milan goalkeeper Andre Onana after he was dismissed from the team following a disagreement with coach Rigobert Song over team tactics. .Brazil have won all seven of their historical World Cup matches against African sides scoring 20 and only conceding twice.

However, a rapid-fire second half, with the lead being traded between the teams, stirred the dreams of Costa Rica fans – until Kai Havertz’s brace and Niclas Fullkrug’s goal at the end of regulation time snuffed out their hopes. .Notably, history was also made in this match as French referee Stephane Frappart became the first woman to officiate a men’s World Cup clash.",270

And she has done what she needs to be physically on the top.” .Frappart became the first woman to referee a French Ligue 1 match in 2019, and the first woman to officiate at a men’s Champions League match in 2020. Last year, she became the first woman to take charge of a men’s World Cup qualifying match. .“I think I’ll have everything that’s around me in mind, and the aim will still be the same, that is the referee according to the performance on the pitch,” Frappart said back in June, after being named as one of the referees for the World Cup in Qatar. .“So, I’m really going to head into this with enormous emotion, but you have to channel that because, clearly, the important thing is the pitch.” .Frappart has made regular donations to her former club and visits on a regular basis. .“She stayed humble. She can chat with anyone without giving it too much thought, from the person she meets in a bar, to someone on the street or just a kid,” Calve said. “She hasn’t changed. Everyone who knows her knows that.” .Frappart is the pride of the town and an inspiration. .“To me, it’s a source of pride [that a woman referees at the men’s World Cup for the first time] and it’s a step forward for our rights, in allowing [women] to occupy more positions that are given in priority to men,” Dominique Edeyer, café owner in Herblay, told Reuters news agency.",271

But it all changed in the second half, with Japan scoring two quick goals against the Spaniards. .Costa Rica also equalised against Germany who then hit the post three times before Juan Vargas put the Central Americans ahead. .That would have put Costa Rica through at the expense of Spain but substitute Kai Havertz scored twice and Niclas Fullkrug got another goal. .It is the second World Cup in a row in which Germany have been eliminated in the group stage. Germany finished third in the Group E standings, behind Spain on goal difference, with Japan top following their 2-1 win over the Spaniards. The result left Japan facing Croatia in the last 16, while Spain will take on Morocco. .Thursday’s game was also historic as it was the first men’s World Cup game to be refereed by a woman. Three of the four match officials – France’s Stephanie Frappart, Brazil’s Neuza Back and Mexico’s Karen Diaz Medina – were women. .“In the first half I was disappointed and very angry at my team and how we allowed the opponent to come back,” said Germany coach Hansi Flick. .“We wanted to score three or four goals in the first half but then we made mistakes. If we had converted those chances, 16 of them. But the tournament was not decided today for us. We did not have any efficiency at this tournament and that is why we were eliminated.” .Germany were teetering on the brink of elimination going into the game, after losing their opening group match to Japan and then snatching a 1-1 draw against Spain. .Needing only victory to avoid a repeat of their shock 2018 World Cup first round exit, Germany, with seven Bayern Munich players in their lineup, charged forward from the start in search of an early goal to settle their nerves. .Jamal Musiala cut from left into the box and tested keeper Keylor Navas with a low drive in the second minute. .It was one-way traffic initially and unmarked Thomas Muller should have done much better when he was picked out by Joshua Kimmich but could not keep his header on target. .Serge Gnabry, however, scored with his glancing header in the 10th minute to put Germany in front. .Costa Rica, who needed at least a point to have a chance to progress, rarely crossed into the German half, with only about 25 percent possession in the first 45 minutes. .Germany were eager to make amends for their bad tournament start, with teenager Jamal Musiala repeatedly taking on the entire Costa Rican defence. .The chances kept coming but the Germans, as in the game against Japan, struggled to convert them. .They were almost punished when Keysher Fuller benefitted from a double defensive blunder but his shot was tipped over the bar by Manuel Neuer, whose 19th appearance at the tournament was a World Cup record for goalkeepers. .With the group standings flashing up on the big screen of Al Bayt Stadium, Germany grew nervous with Musiala twice hitting the post early in the second half. .Neuer, however, could do nothing 13 minutes after the restart when Costa Rica’s Yeltsin Tejeda thundered the ball past him on the rebound after he had first saved a Kendall Waston header. .Juan Pablo Vargas then appeared to have bundled the ball over the line in the 70th minute to put Costa Rica in front but the effort was later credited as a Neuer own goal. .Substitute Havertz scored twice in 12 minutes and Fullkrug added another in stoppage time but ultimately it was too little too late and Spain advanced with a superior goal difference.",272

The Spanish striker rose highest to head a cross home, scoring his third goal in the tournament. .Ritsu Doan equalised in the 48th minute with a left-footed shot from outside the box just minutes after coming on as a substitute at halftime, and Ao Tanaka added the second one from close range a few minutes later. .It took about two minutes for video review officials to confirm the ball had not gone out of bounds before the goal. .Japan finished top of Group E, with Spain finishing second on goal difference – consigning Germany to elimination, despite a 4-2 win over Costa Rica on Thursday. .It was a dramatic finale to the group with qualification within sight for all four teams in the final stretch of both games. .In the second half, Costa Rica took the lead against Germany – a result that would have meant elimination for Spain, who were losing to Japan. But the Germans were quick to equalise and retake the lead. .With the clock ticking down, Japan seemed safe until Germany made it 4-2 against Costa Rica. A late Spanish goal could have sent the Japanese from first to third place in the group. But the Samurai Blue managed to hold on and weather waves of Spanish attacks. .By the end of the game, Spain had 82 percent possession, completing 1,058 passes compared to Japan’s 228. But the Japanese were simply more clinical, and Japan’s coach Hajime Moriyasu’s substitutions in the second half, including bringing on Doan, proved decisive. .Japan had also shocked Germany 2-1 in its Group E opener at the same venue. .Next week, Japan – who have never progressed beyond the first knockout round – will meet Croatia in the round of 16, and Spain will take on Morocco. Even before the game, it was pointed out that Spain may be better off as second in the group to avoid a potential quarter-final against Brazil. .The World Cup continues on Friday with the final day of the group stage to settle Groups H and G.

This is an incredible achievement for us,” Alami said, adding that the qualification will “unite our country”. .The 37-year-old tourism coordinator said there will be nonstop celebrations back home. .“The party will continue until Fajr [the dawn prayer for Muslims], today,” Alami said. .Many supporters stayed on after the game ended and continued their celebrations outside the gates of the stadium. .“Always Morocco,” they cheered as they laughed with friends and family, and of course, took selfies to mark the historic occasion. .Hundreds of revellers gathered near the FIFA music stage, many carrying their children on their shoulders, shouting out “Viva la Maghreb”, or “Long Live Morocco”. .On the pitch, the Morocco players held up the flag of Palestine, something that fans have also done throughout the tournament in solidarity with the Palestinians living under occupation. .Meanwhile, Canada fans were less buoyant as they resigned themselves to their team’s exit from the tournament after losing both of their previous games. .“I think it was a good game. It’s not fun to lose,” Kelly White, 44, told Al Jazeera. .“But this tournament for us was to show the world we are [a football] nation. We can compete at the highest level,” she said. “Hopefully we will be better in 2026 when Canada will be the host. I can’t wait!” .Even before kickoff, the atmosphere at the nearly 45,000-capacity venue was electrifying. .Morocco fans, who have been exuberant in their support for their national team throughout the tournament, slowly made their way into the venue in several large groups, singing and dancing to Arab and French songs, including Algerian singer Khaled’s C’est la vie, to uplift the mood. .Once the game started, every move forward by the Atlas Lions was cheered with thunderous roars. Their supporters jeered and booed loudly each time their team was fouled. .“This is a huge win, not just for Morocco but all Arabs,” Mohammed Hisham, from Marrakesh, told Al Jazeera. .“All my friends from Tunisia or Lebanon or Qatar are behind us,” the 36-year-old, who lives in Doha, added. .“The World Cup being in the Middle East is already a major achievement – now this qualification, it’s remarkable.”",274

279,Published On 1 Dec 2022,"Despite early World Cup exit, Canada have high hopes for future","World Cup appearance is boosting the popularity and development of football among Canadian youth, experts say.",".Montreal, Canada – Rocco Placentino says it still feels surreal. .Less than two years ago, Ismael Kone was playing football for CS Saint-Laurent, a semi-professional team in Montreal, where Placentino, a former midfielder with the Montreal Impact, is the sporting director. .And now, at just 20 years old, Kone is competing on the sport’s biggest stage in front of tens of thousands of spectators at the 2022 World Cup. .“We’re very proud of him, and it opens a door to the youth all over the world to say, ‘Maybe one day, it could be me.’ He’s quickly become a role model for a lot of youngsters, that’s for sure,” Placentino told Al Jazeera in a phone interview from Qatar. .Although Canada impressed with a strong showing against Belgium in their opening match of the tournament last week and scored their first-ever World Cup goal against Croatia on Sunday, the team lost both games and will not advance to the round of 16. .Still, for Placentino and many others in the sport, the measure of success for the Canadian men’s team goes beyond wins and losses – and there is a lot to be optimistic about. .“I only see us going forward. I think that it’s just the beginning, especially now that we’re hosting the World Cup [with the United States and Mexico] in 2026, so it’s just going to get better and better,” Placentino said. “I think it’s very exciting for soccer in Canada.” . .The Canadian men’s team only competed at a World Cup once before, losing three group-stage matches in Mexico in 1986, and its track record over the years has been marked by more struggles than achievements. .In contrast, the Canadian women’s team has seen tremendous international success, winning Olympic gold under the leadership of superstar forward Christine Sinclair, the world’s all-time leading scorer among women and men. Currently, the team is number seven in the FIFA world rankings ahead of next year’s’s Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. .“While the men’s team was quietly suffering, losing, yearning to pass that elusive global threshold, the women’s team was changing the game and transforming the landscape of Canadian soccer,” journalist Harley Rustad recently wrote in The Walrus news magazine. .Still, those close to the game have said the men’s qualification for this year’s World Cup is helping to shift perceptions and build a football audience in a country that has historically been dominated by hockey. .John DeBenedictis, executive director of the National Soccer Coaches Association of Canada, told Al Jazeera that the team is gaining valuable experience by competing against “top-rated opponents” in Qatar and their prospects can only improve. .“I think Canada is going to be there from here on in,” said DeBenedictis, author of the book, The Last 9 Seconds: The Secrets to Scoring Goals on the Last Touch. “This is just a great start.” .He added that television ads showcasing some of the Canadian team’s top stars – including Alphonso Davies, who scored Canada’s first-ever World Cup goal 67 seconds into their game with Croatia – also help to inspire young Canadian players. .“Alphonso’s in almost every commercial you see, so there’s something to aspire to,” he said. .That was echoed by Les Jones, the former chairman of the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame, who said the team’s showing in Qatar will encourage Canadian youth to take the sport more seriously because “they’ve seen what they can achieve”. .“We have a lot of very talented kids at the academy level, and I think it will encourage them to work harder and develop their skills,” he told Al Jazeera. .Although Canada perhaps is lacking in shooting accuracy, Jones said he believes Canada has demonstrated that they “can compete with established soccer nations”. He said playing on the World Cup stage also allows more Canadian footballers to be noticed by established clubs and gives them a better shot at playing at the highest levels abroad. .That means at the next World Cup, “the youngsters on the team will be four years older, four years wiser and they’ll be technically better,” Jones said. “If we think Canada played well now, I think you’re going to see a marked improvement in 2026.” .Before their 2022 World Cup foray ends, Canada will face Morocco at Al Thumama Stadium on Thursday. It will be a final opportunity for Canada to achieve another first: The team has never won or drawn at a World Cup, losing all five matches they have ever played and thus never earning a point in the group stage. .Getting a victory or even a draw versus a confident Moroccan team will be no easy feat as the Atlas Lions are heading into the match still buzzing over a surprise 2-0 victory over Belgium, which is ranked second in the world. .But Canadian defender Alistair Johnston voiced confidence in a news conference on Monday. .“We have a really good young group, and it does make a difference, getting that first goal,” he said. “It changes something mentally.” .Johnston said that earning a point with a draw in the group stage or three points with a win would help Canada in other competitions as well, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup and future World Cups. .“To be able to get a first win or a first draw, a first result, just to be able to say you’ve done that and been a part of that, it just helps alleviate some of those mental barriers,” said the defender, who is reported to be nearing a deal to join Celtic FC in the Scottish Premiership. .It would also establish that the Canadian team belongs on the international stage, he said. .“We’ve been fighting that for a long time, [for] that feeling of belongingness,” Johnston told reporters. “So a result against Morocco I think would really go a long way in solidifying that.”",279

Argentina next face Australia in their round-of-16 game on Saturday. .“I wasn’t worried when we lost the first game,” said Mauricio, an Argentina. He has travelled to Qatar from one of the southernmost cities in the world, Ushuaia. “When we won the World Cup in 1978 and 1986, we started our campaign with a loss. So if everything goes to plan, we are winning this year too!” .Holding up his island’s flag, Mauricio said he spent nearly all his savings, and close to two days on aeroplanes and airports in order to reach Qatar. And he is not going back without a trophy. .“This is why we sing “we want to win the cup!” .For Federico, a fan from Buenos Aires, the journey was slightly shorter but one he hopes will finally end Argentina’s search for a third title. He has been following the Argentinian team at the World Cup since 1994, and he said he was not worried when Argentina lost against Saudi Arabia. .“Today, the team showed why it came into the tournament with a 36-game unbeaten run,” he said with the reassurance of a fan who is confident of his team’s progress to the final. .“Personally, I don’t mind if we don’t win the cup, but I want them to do it for Messi. He deserves it after everything he has given us,” Federico shouted over loud chanting and singing inside a Doha metro train. .Federico said the fans try to repay their football idol by chanting his name loudly during matches, and the Argentinian fans surrounding him nodded. And they will not stop — not until Messi, they hope, lifts the World Cup at Lusail Stadium on December 18.",282
283,Published On 1 Dec 2022,How music became embedded in Ghanaian football fan culture,"A culture that began with local league football is now symbolic of patriotism, for Ghanaians supporting the Black Stars.",".Accra, Ghana – In 2006, Ghana made its maiden appearance at the World Cup. It was a long overdue arrival for the proud footballing nation which at the time had won four African Championships, two FIFA U-17 World Cup titles, and two FIFA U-20 World Cup trophies. .The palpable excitement on the streets was eventually encapsulated in Yenie, a song by the gospel singer Grace Ashy meaning “This is Us” in the local Twi language. It played nonstop in private cars and public transport, on airwaves, and was sung affectionately by children converging in compounds to discuss their favourite players. .In the Black Stars’ dressing rooms and on the team bus, players led the team in singing the song ahead of games. Striker Asamoah Gyan who was part of the 2006 team and remains the country’s all-time leading goal-scorer, was noted for leading many such sessions. .The inspiration for the song came from “being a patriotic citizen”, Ashy told Al Jazeera. .The singer, who has gone on to record five other songs for the team, eventually received a presidential honour from ex-Ghanaian President John Agyekum Kufuor, alongside members of the squad after they exited in the last 16. .Music and colour have always been integral to domestic football, prominent broadcaster Gloria Peprah told Al Jazeera. .“Growing up in Kokomlemle [a town in Accra], club football fans from Olympics FC, Accra Hearts of Oak, and Kotoko would tout their horns, wave their flags, and all that. As a child, it was exciting though I never understood the rivalry and all that,” she said. .Songs sung in support of your team in the West African country usually come in one of three forms, Abraham Nkansah, leader of the Die-Hard Supporters Union told Al Jazeera. There are folk songs in another local language, Ga, called “kpanlogo”, brass band music and then the most popular of them all – “jama” songs. .Jama – a word originating from Ga for songs sung at events – is a genre of cheer songs with lyrics from Twi, Ga, Ewe, and Pidgin languages passed across generations of sports fans. Composed to praise one’s team and banter with opposing teams, fans say they help boost the morale of the fans in cheering for their team. .In 1970, club football in Ghana reached its peak as Asante Kotoko Sporting Club of Kumasi – the country’s second largest city – won the CAF  [Confederation of African Football] Champions League, the first for a team from the country. .Their fan base soon found ways to assert bragging rights through jama songs fusing sounds from homemade instruments like “bugarabu” drums, agogo, castanets, shekere and trumpets with local rhythms like highlife to create jama songs. .Other supporters followed suit, creating a boisterous atmosphere at games as they willed their teams to victory and jeered opposing sides. .But the club rivalries fizzled out whenever it was time to unite for the Black Stars. .After Ghana qualified for Germany in 2006, Ashy’s Yenie was one of the first Black Stars-themed songs specifically fashioned for the World Cup – to unify fans nationwide. .“I believe my cheer songs inspired citizens to be supportive and also fostered unity amongst the people of Ghana irrespective of their background,” Ashy said. .That same year, Straight to the Top, an all-English tune was composed and sung by Talal Fatal, then a songwriter and music producer but now CEO of an Accra-based TV channel. .Like Yenie, it was a slight departure from jama culture but also became a hit. .“You know during that time, television was limited and so were the stations and I remember when Ghana scored a goal”, Peprah said. “The songs would be played during half-time and Ghanaians will be so excited singing “we’re going straight to the top’.” .Soon, producing football songs in studios became a norm but only a few captured the attention of fans, especially those incorporating the familiar jama rhythms. .When Ghana made it to the quarterfinals of the 2010 tournament in South Africa, Yenie and a number of other songs released  – to varying success – were soundtracks. .During every match day, every goal, and post-match analysis, pubs blasted the songs on huge public address systems and fans randomly sang and drummed in the streets. It was a chaotic rendition of fan love. .After Ghana qualified for the 2022 World Cup, more songs were released including most notably a freestyle track from Gyan who is now retired, as well as from highlife musician Akwaboah and rapper Kweku Flick. .“Jama is meant to ginger the players,” Sani Mohammed, founder of Ghana First Supporters Union (GAFSU) told Al Jazeera. “Without the jama, the players will be dull and can’t score goals. You could see from our game with Portugal [at Qatar 2022] that the jama was what boosted the morale of the players to score [two] goals.” .If supporters in the stands do not sing the jama tunes, being present at the stadium means nothing, he added. . .But Ashy who believes she paved the way for this new era of football chants, says she is yet to earn royalties or monetary compensation for their work. .“I never received support from the government for producing the song but I guess being a citizen of Ghana, this is my quota for my nation,” she said. .In 2013, the singer told a local newspaper that the Ghanaian Football Association (GFA) and the Black Stars were ungrateful but she did not regret it because “I did it for God and country”. .Still Ashy says hearing her songs being sung along to at stadiums, football bars, and elsewhere, makes her happy and inspired. “For me, I think we did a great job,” she said.",283
284,Published On 1 Dec 2022,World Cup 2022: Belgium vs Croatia match preview,,".Who: Belgium vs Croatia, Group F .Where: Al-Rayyan Stadium .When: Thursday, December 1, at 6pm (15:00 GMT) .FIFA ranking: Belgium (2), Croatia (12) .Speculation over Belgium’s demise is greatly exaggerated, Croatia’s head coach Zlatko Dalic said ahead of Thursday’s decisive showdown between the two Group F sides. .“We are playing against the second-best football team in the world and they were number one,” he told reporters on Wednesday. .Indeed, the Red Devils, as Belgium are known, are currently ranked behind only Brazil by FIFA. But while Dalic knows his team can’t take them lightly, Belgium stand on the precipice of a shock World Cup exit as they head into Thursday’s match. .Belgium’s opening game against Canada saw them outplayed for large parts of the 90 minutes, and they were lucky to escape with three points after some wayward finishing from the opposition. .They were further humbled in their second match when a rampant Morocco defeated them with two second-half goals. Belgium’s flat performance led Kevin de Bruyne to say his team, which came third at the 2018 World Cup, is “too old” to achieve World Cup success this year. .Later, reports emerged that there had been a dressing room argument between De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and veteran defender Jan Vertonghen. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has since dismissed these reports as “invented stories”. .What’s definitely real is the risk of elimination the Belgians face as they take on Croatia, who have enjoyed a better start to the World Cup. .Croatia played out a cagey goalless draw against Morocco in their opening match but fired four past Canada in their second game. .Both teams reached the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, with Croatia beating England 2-1 in extra time and Belgium narrowly losing to eventual winners France 1-0. .Belgium, who head into the final group stage match with only three points, must win to guarantee qualification. A draw would suffice only if Canada beat Morocco by a margin of four goals in their Group F game, which will be played at the same time. .Croatia have a simpler route to the Round of 16. A draw would guarantee qualification. But Dalic ruled out any notion that his team would be happy to play for a draw. .“We will play as we did against Canada, high quality, high tempo. It’s going to be a difficult game,” he said. .Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku, who has been struggling with a thigh injury, could start for Belgium after coming on as a substitute against Canada. Defensive midfielder Amadou Onana is suspended after receiving two yellow cards in the first two games and will likely be replaced by Youri Tielemans. .Despite the team’s struggles so far, Belgian defender Timothy Castagne dismissed suggestions that the side was in trouble. .“The first two games were not as good as we hoped. We didn’t show everything we are capable of,” Castagne said. “But we are not in crisis.” .It’s unclear whether Ivan Perisic, the Tottenham Hotspur winger who claimed two assists against Canada, will be able to start for Croatia after being hurt. He might be replaced by Dinamo Zagreb’s Mislav Orsic. .The game between the top-ranked sides of Group F was always going to be a tough contest. As one of the final matches of a still-undecided group, it is now a decisive contest that could crush dreams or lift hopes.",284
285,Published On 1 Dec 2022,French-Tunisians in Paris celebrate bittersweet World Cup win,Café El Emir’s patrons have ties to their adopted country France and their home in Tunisia. There was only one victor.,".Paris, France – Café El Emir in Paris smelled of fresh mint and hookah smoke. Behind the counter, Samy was pouring mint tea for customers who had trickled in to watch Tunisia take on France in the World Cup 2022. .Before the match, he was not confident Tunisia would pull through. .“This is going to be Tunisia’s last match of the World Cup,” Samy told Al Jazeera. “The odds are stacked against us.” .Samy’s conclusion before the game: “C’est chaud (It doesn’t look good).” .And he was right. Tunisia stunned reigning champions France 1-0 but were still knocked out after Australia beat Denmark in the other group match. .El Emir had broadcast all of Tunisia’s World Cup matches, serving tea and hookahs to a packed house of Tunisian fans who gathered in front of two flat-screen TVs inside and on the terrace. .The café sits smack in the middle of Paris’s Belleville neighbourhood, which is the place to visit for authentic fish couscous, rose-flavoured pastries or other Tunisian specialities in the French capital. .For decades, Belleville has been home to thousands of Tunisians in France. On Wednesday, they came out in droves to support their home country against their adopted one. .The crowd at El Emir was diverse – old and young, men and women, speaking French and Arabic and sometimes both at the same time. .Halil, 25, said he arrived in France from Tunis a few months ago. He admitted it was strange watching his new home take on the country of his birth but said he knew which team got his support. .“I like France, but I’m rooting for Tunisia,” Halil told Al Jazeera. “Tunisia is my team.” .France is home to the largest Tunisian expat community – at least 187,000 Tunisia-born people live in the country and even more French nationals are descendants of Tunisian immigrants. A lot of people watching the match at El Emir had ties to both countries, which made this match a bit peculiar. .“This match goes beyond just sport,” said Tunisia fan Mohammed. “We have a shared history, economic ties, cultural ties.” .Mohammed came to France from Tunisia aged five and said he still feels strongly connected to his birthplace. .While many fans at El Emir seemed pretty relaxed as the match began, they quickly started inching forward in their seats and wringing their hands. .Tunisia dominated early on and the crowd loved it. They burst into singing and chanting: “We’ll play and we’ll win.” .When hometown hero Wahbi Khazri scored the second-half goal, the fans on El Emir’s terrace were overjoyed. The whole place exploded. .“This is Tunisia’s game!” exclaimed Mohammed Messaoudi. “I wasn’t sure at first, but now we have it in the bag.” .That mood did not last though, because even though Tunisia were winning, it wasn’t enough to progress. Several people started watching the Australia-Denmark match on their phones. .All hope seemed lost when Antoine Griezmann scored a goal in injury time, and El Emir’s terrace started emptying as disappointed fans poured out. A few minutes later, those who remained exploded into cries of joy. The goal was ruled out. Tunisia had won. .“We did it. We won,” they shouted. .It’s the first time Tunisia has defeated France in a World Cup, an upset that will likely go down in history. But for many Tunisian fans in Paris, the victory is tinged with disappointment. .“It’s a historic victory, we beat the world champions,” said 43-year-old Tunisian fan Chakib Ellili. “But it’s still a bit bittersweet since we’re not moving forward. We missed our chance when we lost to Australia in our second match, but we’re very proud of our team.” .Mohammed, the 29-year-old Tunisian who has lived in Paris since he was five, said he would support other Arab teams like Morocco or Saudi Arabia moving forward. .Samy and his coworker Taoufik at El Emir said their decision was easy. They’re cheering on France. .“I’m a Tunisia fan, but I’m also a France fan,” said Taoufik. “Always have been, always will be.”",285

Adoring fans can still pose for selfies with the football icons – or life-size statues of them. .What sounds like a football lover’s dream is actually an interactive exhibition on South American football in the heart of Doha’s Msheireb Downtown area. .The exhibition has been set up by local tourism authorities in collaboration with the South American Football Federation to give fans a taste of the region’s rich football history, which continues to inspire supporters across the world. Between Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, South American nations have won nine of the previous 21 World Cups. .The vibrant open-air and free-for-all setup is hard to miss for tourists or locals strolling by Sikkat Al Wadi, the popular pedestrian street that hosts the exhibition, or for those making their way to Souq Waqif for a flavour of traditional Qatar. It is open from 2pm to 10pm every day during the World Cup in Qatar. .Visitors can savour the victories of legends from the continent as well as test their football skills by participating in different challenges.  Aspiring footballers can check their shooting accuracy by trying to target marked corners of a goal. Or they can test their dribbling and juggling skills while a timer is on. .On the eve of the Argentina-Poland match on Wednesday, a young footballer in a Messi shirt runs between poles in the dribbling challenge but loses the ball halfway, inviting a Polish fan to say: “I hope that’s how (Lionel) Messi plays tomorrow.” .Argentina beat Poland 2-0, even though Messi missed a penalty. .In another part of the exhibition, where goal-scoring speed is measured, a four-year-old girl, Haya, tries to score as her dad holds her to help. .Music from different parts of South America plays as people walk around and look up at the Tree of Dreams, which stands in the middle of the exhibition and carries the names of the region’s famous footballers. .An intense game between children, two on each side, is under way in a small, enclosed replica of a football pitch. Parents and other onlookers say “ooh” and “aah” when a young boy scores a goal just as the buzzer goes off, indicating full time. .Team shirts signed by players of all South American teams participating in this World Cup are on display on a colourful balcony designed in the style of Brazilian favelas. .Football fans stand a chance of winning one of these by picking their all-time greatest South American team in an interactive team selection game. .A half-yellow, half-blue part of the exhibition pays homage to two of the greatest footballers the region has produced. Signed shirts, replica boots and trophies, and famous quotes by both Diego Maradona and Pele are neatly divided into their respective sections. Fans stop to stare at the trophies and shirts, then proceed to join a queue and get a photo with the legends’ statues. .Both World Cup winners have wide smiles on their faces and trophies in their hands. Fans take selfies with their arms around the statues, ask friends to record them having a pretend conversation with the players or simply mimic holding the trophy with them. .These statues are so popular, fans try to get photos with them even when the exhibition has closed. .“Some people stop by after we have closed for the night and beg us to let them take a photo with the statues,” one of the security guards told Al Jazeera after the exhibition had shut for the night. .Just then, an Argentinian fan began pleading with the guard to let him through as he had a flight to catch and would not get a chance to come back the next afternoon. The guard duly obliged, letting him slip in for a quick selfie.",286

A draw between Spain and Japan — or a win for Japan — would bring goal difference into play, if Germany does defeat Costa Rica. .Spain top the group on four points ahead of Japan and Costa Rica, both on three. .Scoring has not been a strong point for German coach Hansi Flick’s team but centre forward Niclas Fuellkrug’s excellent run for club and country in recent months has improved their prospects. The 29-year-old, an unlikely addition to the squad prior to the tournament, snatched a late equaliser against Spain after coming on as a substitute to keep their hopes alive going into the final group match. .The burly striker is now a serious option to lead the line on Thursday with many German pundits and fans demanding he start. .However, assistant coach Marcus Sorg dampened expectations over Fuellkrug, saying he was “not a cure-all” for the team’s problems. .“We have to see what effect which player has at any given time,” Sorg said. “We need a certain structure, stability and security. Security comes with consistency.” .Whatever line-up Germany go with, they know their task is to preserve what remains of their once powerful tournament reputation, having failed to win the first two matches in a World Cup group for the first time. .Germany’s opponents on Thursday haven’t had a great time of it either — Costa Rica have had just one shot on target in their two matches. .Still, that shot resulted in the goal that brought them victory over Japan and kept their qualification hopes alive. If they defeat Germany and Spain beat Japan, they will finish second in the group. It would be some story for a team that lost its first game 7-0 to make it to the Round of 16.",287

Morocco registered more shots on target even though the Red Devils dominated possession and were ultimately more clinical, netting two goals in the second half. .Morocco have yet to concede, with Paris Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi marshalling a well-drilled defensive line that kept Croatia at bay in their opening match. .A draw against Canada, who are already out of the tournament, would guarantee Morocco a place in the Round of 16. They could even progress with a defeat, depending on the result of Belgium’s match with Croatia – which will be held at the same time. .And indeed, Morocco – even in their current form – will know Canada are no pushover. They were unlucky to lose their first game against Belgium after dominating large segments of the match and linked up well in midfield, creating several chances. In the end, it was wayward finishing that cost them, including a penalty miss from Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies. .Davies was able to redeem himself in the next match against Croatia, scoring the tournament’s fastest goal so far, but his team would go on to lose the game 4-1. .This is Canada’s second appearance at the World Cup, and they will be looking to pick up their first-ever point in the competition against Morocco. .The Atlas Lions are more experienced on football’s biggest stage: This is their fifth appearance at the World Cup, and it would be the second time they reach the knockout phase if they progress, having made it to the round of 16 at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. .Morocco can expect significant support at the Al Thumama stadium on Thursday based on the atmosphere at their first two matches. The two sides have met on three occasions, with Morocco winning two and one ending in a draw. On Thursday, either of those outcomes will suffice for the team from North Africa.",288

It’s hard to describe the emotions right now,” Leckie told Australian broadcaster SBS after the game. .“We always knew we could do it as a group. We had our doubters but our spirit, our belief, our work ethic and how close we are as a group shows on the pitch. The last 15, 20 minutes, we battled until the end.” .There were celebrations in Australia and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed what he called a “magnificent win”. .Australia now face Argentina on Saturday. .Argentina vs Poland .It was a comfortable win for Argentina over Poland as the South American giants topped Group C and confirmed their place in the knockout stage. .Helped by a relentless Lionel Messi, Argentina notched up a 2-0 victory at Stadium 974, with both goals coming in the second half. .Alexis Mac Allister and Julian Alvarez’s goals capped a dominant display by coach Lionel Scaloni’s players with tens of thousands of raucous supporters packing the stadium to cheer on their team. .Messi never stopped surging forward and posed a menace to Poland throughout the game with his dribbling ability and vision. .His glittering performance stood in stark contrast to that of Poland’s star striker Robert Lewandowski who failed to make an impact. .Messi, 35, has admitted that Qatar will probably be his last World Cup while Lewandoski, who is a year younger, has said he is unsure if he will make it to the next tournament, which is being held in North America in 2026. .Despite Poland’s lacklustre performance they still managed to make it through to the knockout phase on goal difference.

They were tied with Poland on goal difference, goals scored and head-to-head points, but the Polish team had a better fair play record – fewer yellow cards. .A goal by Argentina would have also been enough for Mexico. But as the final whistle blew on the Poland-Argentina game, Salem Aldawsari scored against Mexico in the 95th minute making it 2-1. .“It’s a hard blow, there are no words,” said Mexico midfielder Edson Alvarez. “The team went out looking for it from the start and we had a lot of chances. But we couldn’t score and that leaves a bitter taste.” .Hirving Lozano, who saw a late goal disallowed for offside, apologised to Mexico fans for not doing enough in the first two matches – a goalless draw against Poland and a 2-0 loss to Argentina. .“We could have done more, but that’s football,” he said. “I always live the games to the maximum, always giving myself every game, every ball … but well, the results didn’t come.” .Despite the late goal, it was a disappointing result for Saudi Arabia, who started the tournament on a high, beating Argentina 2-1 against the odds. .The loss to Mexico that followed a 2-0 defeat to Poland means Saudi Arabia finish bottom of the group. .In the Round of 16, Poland will face France, and Argentina will take on Australia.",293

Australia grew into the game as the first half went on and mounted several counterattacks, but the game remained goalless at half time. .A moment of magic from Leckie broke the deadlock on the hour mark. As Denmark pushed men forward, Australia broke and a through ball found Leckie in acres of space on the left. He twisted the Danish full-back Joakim Maehle one way, then the other, before passing the ball past Kasper Schmeichel and into the far corner. .“I’m proud, exhausted, everything really. It’s hard to describe the emotions right now,” Leckie told Australian broadcaster SBS after the game. .“We always knew we could do it as a group. We had our doubters but our spirit, our belief, our work ethic and how close we are as a group shows on the pitch. The last 15, 20 minutes, we battled until the end. .“It didn’t matter what they threw at us, we weren’t conceding. We’ll make the most of it tonight, but then it’s all about recovery.” .After the Australian goal, Denmark poured forward in search of goals. But although they had a likely penalty overruled for offside, they rarely looked like scoring. .With 10 minutes left on the clock, the referee awarded Denmark a penalty for a foul on Kasper Dolberg, but it was quickly overturned after the flag was raised for offside. .With Tunisia taking the lead against France in the other Group D match, it looked like Australia would need to see out the win to progress. They nervously weathered waves of Danish attacks to claim the 1-0 victory and finish second in the group, behind France and ahead of Tunisia. .The Danes – semi-finalists in last year’s Euros – will be disappointed to finish bottom of the group. .Australia, through to the last 16 of a World Cup for the first time since 2006, celebrated wildly. The Socceroos will face off against the winner of Group C, which could be Poland, Argentina or Saudi Arabia. .The Australians will know their exact opponent by the end of the day after Poland and Argentina face off, and Saudi Arabia take on Mexico. .This is only the second time that Australia have qualified for the knockout stages. In 2006, they crashed out of the round of 16 to eventual champions Italy after a 1-0 loss. .At the final whistle, Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hailed what he called a “magnificent” victory. . .But Australia’s coach Graham Arnold said he is more focused on the work ahead than the jubilations after the win. .“We’ve been working on this for four-and-a-half years, and I could see in their eyes they were ready tonight,” Arnold said. .“No celebrations tonight. That’s why we won after a great win against Tunisia: no celebrations, no emotion, sleep and no social media.”",297

The suspension will last for the rest of the tournament. .The federation said it had booked Onana a flight back to Milan, where the goalie plays for Inter Milan. . .Onana also released a statement alluding to his disagreement with Song over team tactics, which had led to him being dropped for Cameroon’s 3-3 draw with Serbia on Monday. .Onana said he had tried to resolve the issues in an attempt to remain part of the squad. .“I have put all my efforts and energy into finding solutions to a situation that a footballer often experiences, but there has been no will on the other side,” Onana said. “Some moments are difficult to assimilate.” .He added he respected the decisions “of the people in charge”. .Onana had played in Cameroon’s opening game at the World Cup, a 1-0 loss to Switzerland, but was dropped for the Serbia game and did not travel with the rest of the squad to Al Janoub Stadium. Cameroon fought back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3. .Song said it was a risk to play with reserve goalkeeper Devis Epassy but insisted he had to take “strong action” against Onana, one of Cameroon’s best players. .“If you can’t fit in with what’s required to be part of a squad then I do think that you need to step up to the plate and accept responsibility for that because the team, the squad, is more important than the interests of any individual,” Song said on Monday after the Serbia game without going into details of his disagreement with Onana. .He added he needed all his players to “show discipline and respect”. .In his statement, Onana said he was disappointed that he was “not allowed” to be with the team at the Serbia game and denied that he had broken any squad disciplinary rules. .“I always behaved in a way to lead the team to success in a good manner,” Onana said. .Cameroon still has a chance of qualifying for the last 16 at the World Cup but needs to beat top-ranked Brazil in its final Group G game and hope that the result of the Switzerland-Serbia match goes in its favour.",300

Souttar appeared almost out of nowhere to slide in with a thunderous tackle that would have had hard-nut defenders of yesteryear nodding their approval. Souttar’s defending skills have been widely praised by pundits with many predicting he will be a target for a Premier League club in January. .Tunisia are faced with the huge task of upsetting World Cup title-holders France on Wednesday if they are to stand a chance of advancing to the knockouts. A goalless draw between Australia and Denmark could see Tunisia go second if they beat France – it’s a big ask but the brave Eagles of Carthage could still soar. .  .Don’t forget that Tunisia were the first African country to win a game at the World Cup finals when they beat Mexico 3-1 in Argentina in 1978. Ten of Tunisia’s 26-man squad were born in France and they have three players based at French clubs. .But, France were the first team to secure qualification through to the round of 16 at his World Cup tournament with wins over Australia and Denmark, and with a game to spare. .  .  .France appear to have shaken off the curse of the defending champions by becoming the first World Cup champs to make it out of the group stage since 2006 – the year defending champs Brazil emerged. Italy, Spain and Germany all were eliminated early four years after winning their World Cup titles. .The team’s pre-tournament injury blues are also fading, and Les Bleus are feeling upbeat again and looking like one of the tournament favourites. .France will look to strike the right balance between resting players and keeping their World Cup momentum up against Tunisia, where even a draw with the Tunisians will guarantee them top spot in their grouping. .Should the French finish first, they will face the team who ends up second in Group C, which features Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Mexico. .Coach Didier Deschamps is set to rest some of his key men and give fringe players minutes in the game. .Kylian Mbappe might be held back in reserve but France’s talismanic forward is chasing records in Qatar and Deschamps could give him some playing time to help him add to his seven World Cup goals – three of which were scored in Qatar. .France’s Antoine Griezmann has returned to his best form and is likely to play deep and also close to lone strikers at the front. .Griezmann has played as an attacking midfielder rather than a pure forward, brilliantly making the link between midfielders Aurelien Tchouameni and Adrien Rabiot and France’s attacking trio of Ousmane Dembele, Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe. .“I probably ask different things from him, but there is no sacrifice on his part,” Deschamps recently said of Griezmann. .“I could have played him on the right flank of the attack instead of Ousmane (Dembele) but that’s not where he would be the most useful to the team,” he said. .Two of the most talented and deadly strikers in world football, Argentina’s 35-year-old Lionel Messi and Poland’s 34-year-old Robert Lewandowski, line up against each other on Wednesday with a last 16 place at stake in the World Cup. .  .Messi has scored twice in Argentina’s extraordinary start to the campaign in Doha, and also suffered one of the biggest upsets in the tournament’s history by losing to Saudi Arabia before masterminding a euphoric victory over Mexico. .Argentina’s 2-0 win over Mexico was the most-watched Spanish-language World Cup group stage broadcast in US history, drawing 8.9 million viewers on Telemundo television and the streaming services of Telemundo and Peacock. .The brilliant Argentinian, whose team are one of the tournament favourites, is playing his fifth and final campaign, meaning it is his last chance to match Diego Maradona and lift the trophy for his longing homeland. .With Argentina second in Group C on three points, one behind the Poles, the Argentinians must win on Wednesday to be sure of progressing and keeping alive their dream of a third World Cup title. .  .A draw would be enough for the South Americans, too, if Mexico and Saudi Arabia also end level. .Like Messi, Poland’s Lewandowski is also his nation’s all-time top scorer and is also on possibly his last mission at a World Cup. He has been in sizzling form for Barcelona (Messi’s old club) and has also had an eventful start in Qatar. .Lewandowski uncharacteristically missed a penalty in Poland’s opening draw with Mexico before scoring his first-ever World Cup goal in their 2-0 win over Saudi Arabia. .Poland, who have not reached the World Cup knockout stage since 1986, could go through with a win or draw against Argentina. .This is the third time Poland and Argentina will meet at the World Cup. Poland won 3-2 in 1974 and Argentina won 2-0 four years later. Argentina have won six of their 11 meetings overall, with Poland winning three. The teams last played an international friendly in June 2011, which Poland won 2-1. .Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski. .Argentina, Mexico and Poland may all have been fancied to progress from Group C at the World Cup ahead of Saudi Arabia, but after their stunning win over the Argentinians, the Saudis are firmly in the mix ahead of their Wednesday game against Mexico. .In their five previous World Cup outings, Saudi Arabia have qualified for the round of 16 only once, on their debut at the tournament in 1994. .At this stage in Qatar, Poland lead Group C on four points, one ahead of Argentina and Saudi Arabia, while Mexico are on one point. .If Saudi Arabia want to progress they will have to beat Mexico on Wednesday, regardless of the outcome of the match between Poland and Argentina. A draw would mean they need Poland to beat Argentina, while a defeat would make the permutations more complicated, as they would need to lose by only one goal while hoping that Poland win their match by a bigger margin. .And the Saudi players can do  it. .Saudi Arabia stunned the football world when they defeated Argentina 2-1 in their opening group game, only to then lose 2-0 to Poland in their second match. .“No one around the world thought that we could play with this level. Yes, in Saudi Arabia we know the players well, but they are unknown to the fans around the world,” Saudi coach Herve Renard told a news conference after the Poland game. .“We are still alive,” he said. The 54-year-old Renard indicated his team will play the next match in Lusail against Mexico with the same energy and desire, and he rallied Saudi supporters. .“We need the fans to make history. I want a green stadium again, maybe we will play in the white jersey, but that isn’t important, we want the support from the fans,” he said. .Things will not be easy for Saudi Arabia. Mexico also have a chance of reaching the last 16, and for them, it will be their eighth time in a row. Mexico needs to beat Saudi Arabia by at least a three-goal margin, with Poland not losing to Argentina. If Argentina beat the Poles, it will depend on the final result. .Mexico will be reminding themselves that they have never lost to Saudi Arabia in five previous matches, and won twice with 5-0 and 5-1 results in the FIFA Confederations Cup. But the Mexicans are struggling offensively and the team did not score a goal in the first two matches against Poland and Argentina. .Mexico will be desperate for Wednesday’s game to not be the first time they fail to score at a World Cup tournament (they have now failed to score in their last four World Cup appearances). .Mexico’s hopes seem to rest on the shoulders of star striker Raul Jimenez. .Saudi Arabia’s Saleh al-Shehri and Salem al-Dawsari scored a goal each against Argentina. Can the pair deliver goals against Mexico? .Certainly two players to watch.",301

Lionel Messi spoke of the days being long in the aftermath of the opening game. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez met a psychologist. Lautaro Martinez said the game against Mexico was akin to a World Cup final. .They entered the Lusail Stadium on Saturday night on the brink of elimination and for the first hour played like a team that deserved to be sent home. .Their inability to cope with the pressure was best evidenced by midfielder Rodrigo de Paul, who seemed unable to string a pass together to save his life. The din at the Argentinian end wasn’t a reflection of fans’ confidence in the team as much as it conveyed the high-stakes nature of the occasion. .The Lusail match was kindled with desperation and Messi’s 65th-minute goal blew its lid off. The most striking image amid the primal scenes that followed was that of Argentina assistant coach Pablo Aimar breaking into tears on the bench. It wasn’t just a goal; it was a stay of execution. . .“We knew that today we had to win, that another World Cup started for us and we knew what to do,” Messi said immediately after the game. .Argentina will have to relive that tension against Poland. They enter the game with points on the board but the pressure remains unchanged. Anything less than a win could leave their fate dependent – yet again – on Saudi Arabia, who play Mexico in their final group stage game. .The Poles currently sit top of the group, with a draw and a win in their first two games. From a points perspective, it’s already their best showing in the group stages since 1982. .Up against a Saudi Arabia side riding high on confidence, they held their nerve and ground out an impressive 2-0 victory. .While Robert Lewandowski stole the headlines for scoring his first World Cup goal, Poland’s win would have been impossible with Wojcieh Szczęsny. The Juventus goalkeeper remained defiant in the face of a resurgent Saudi attack. He stopped Salem Aldawsari’s penalty in the first half and pulled off one of the saves of the tournament in keeping out the rebound that followed. .He is the only goalkeeper to have kept two clean sheets in the tournament so far. Messi and Co will have their work cut out against him. .The stakes are as high for Poland as they are for Argentina. It’s their best opportunity to make it into the knockout stages, a feat they haven’t achieved since 1986. .With one on the precipice of history and the other on the edge of ignominy, this final group game will be the ultimate test of Poland and Argentina’s mettle. Once again, for both sides, it will be no less than a World Cup final.",302

They brought intensity and defensive grit to the game, troubling the Danes, especially in the first half. Yet ultimately, Tunisia could not capitalise on their hard work, and the game ended in a goalless draw. .Their lack of firing power was exposed further in their second match against Australia, where they showed an equally high level of passion and incredible work rate but eventually succumbed to a towering header from Mitchell Duke. .Tunisia have yet to score in 27 shots at this World Cup, something they will have to change if they are to stand a chance of progressing. .  .Yes, a chance. Because even if they win, Tunisia will still have to rely on the result of a simultaneously played Group D game to go their way. .If Australia beat Denmark in that other game, even a Tunisian win won’t help the North African side survive. But if Australia draw their match with Denmark, then a Tunisian win would be enough for them to qualify. .And if Tunisia and Denmark both win their matches, they will be level on points, and qualification will depend on goal difference. .France head into this match having scored six goals in two games and only need a draw to guarantee the top spot in the group. .Tunisia’s defence will have their work cut out on Wednesday, despite France striker and Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema being ruled out through injury. Les Bleus have an embarrassment of riches up front, including Olivier Giroud, who bagged two goals against Australia; Kylian Mbappe, who has scored three tournament goals; Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé. .If they top the group, France will face the team that finishes second in Group C, which features Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Mexico.

An unlucky semi-final Euro 2020 exit and a string of impressive results in the build-up to the World Cup, including wins over France in the Nations League, had created a sense of excitement around this Danish team. .However, expectations plummeted as they were bullied and outplayed in patches during their goalless first game against Tunisia. It was a disjointed performance from the Danes, who struggled to get any foothold in the game. .On Saturday, they performed much better against reigning world champions France, who had to rely on their star striker Kylian Mbappé to rescue them. Denmark were unlucky to lose the game 2-1 and will be highly motivated to overcome an Australian side that might be exhausted after their heroic exploits against Tunisia. .The Socceroos lost their first match 4-1 to France but bounced in their second fixture to beat Tunisia 1-0 in a spirited performance full of grit and determination. .The helter-skelter match was brimming with passion from both sides. The majority of the crowd was behind Tunisia, but the Socceroos showed no fear in the intimidating atmosphere. In the end, a Mitchell Duke header separated the two teams and gave Australia an energy-sapping but morale-boosting win. .Denmark will welcome back their stalwart in defence, Simon Kjaer, who missed the game against France through injury. But it’s not all good news. Thomas Delaney has been ruled out for the rest of the World Cup. The Sevilla player has been a cornerstone of the Danish midfield for years providing cover to their defence; he will be missed. .Denmark and Australia have only scored three goals between them over two games, so goals might be at a premium today. Both teams are defensively organised, and for all their talent, Denmark lack a world-class striker. Andreas Cornelius, the F C Copenhagen striker, has failed to get off the mark so far this tournament and missed a gilt-edged chance against Tunisia, inexplicably heading against the post from point-blank range. .The two teams met at the 2018 World Cup, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. A repeat of that outcome would knock Denmark out of the current edition. .Denmark need a win. If Tunisia also win their final game, against France, it will all come down to goal difference, with both the Danes and the Tunisians level on four points. .Australia have an easier path.

Now they need to beat the Green Falcons, as Saudi Arabia are known, by at least three goals in their final Group C game if they are to guarantee a spot in the last 16. .If Mexico win but with a lower margin, they will need Poland to beat Argentina in a match that will be played at the same time. That combination of results would see Mexico and Poland qualifying for the next round. .Tata Martino, the Mexican coach, has indicated that he expects both teams to go all-out in this must-win match. “Saudi Arabia need to win the match and score goals, and so do we”, he said ahead of the game. .Saudi Arabia head into this match with three points, having recorded a major World Cup upset in their first match by beating Argentina 2-1. .They were unlucky to lose 2-0 to Poland on Saturday. After conceding in the first half, Saudi Arabia had a penalty saved by an inspired Wojciech Szczęsny just before the break. Robert Lewandowski secured a hard-fought Polish win late in the second half. .A win will see Saudi Arabia automatically progress to the last 16. But they can only qualify with a draw if Argentina lose to Poland. .Mexico have never lost to Saudi Arabia. And they’ve made the knockout stages in each of the last seven World Cups. .But they head into this fixture low on confidence after two lacklustre World Cup performances and a string of defeats to Sweden, Colombia and Paraguay in the build-up to the tournament.

306,Published On 30 Nov 2022,How immigration ‘made French football better’,"From Polish miners to heroes of Algerian independence, immigrants have greatly influenced French football.",".On July 12, 1998, France won the World Cup for the first time in its history, thumping a Brazil side that included stars like Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos in a final at the Stade de France in Paris. .After the final whistle, hundreds of thousands of joyous French fans poured onto the Champs-Elysees to celebrate the 3-0 victory. A picture of Zinedine Zidane, the mercurial midfielder who had scored two goals that night, was projected onto the Arc de Triumph along with the words “Merci ZiZou” – Zidane’s nickname – and “Zidane President”. .Zidane, a second-generation Algerian immigrant from a working-class area of Marseille, had been part of a team that included players of Armenian, Ghanaian, Senegalese and Guadeloupean descent. As his name rang through the streets, many heralded the victory as a historic footballing achievement and a celebration of a new multicultural France united under one flag. .The success appeared to be the perfect antidote to a nation struggling to come to terms with its colonial past. The Algerian War of Independence (1954-62), which ended 132 years of colonial rule and represented the final collapse of the French empire, had only been recognised as a war by the French state in 1999. .The team, typically known as Les Bleus but nicknamed this time “Black, Blanc, Beur” (Black, White and Arab) in the media during the 1998 tournament, was hailed as a shining example of successful integration. French newspaper Le Monde labelled them a “symbol of the diversity and of the unity of the country”. Then-French President Jacques Chirac described them as a “tricolour and multicolour team” that had created a “beautiful image of France and its humanity”. .Just two years later, the French team would go on to win the European Championships, with the hero of France 98, Zidane, being named player of the tournament. .Despite the positivity surrounding the team’s success, simmering racial tensions soon began to reappear. .The victories in 1998 and 2000 had been a source of embarrassment for the far-right party, the Front National (FN). Its then leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, had infamously claimed in 1996 that the France team was “artificial” as it contained too many non-white players. He would later describe the French side as “unworthy” representatives who did not know the words of the country’s national anthem. .In 2000, 36 percent of respondents to a French survey said they thought there were too many players of foreign origin on the national team. .A year later, France played Algeria in Paris for the first time since the North African nation gained independence in 1962. What was supposed to be a moment of reconciliation descended into “a horrible mess”, says Timothee Maymon, a sports journalist focusing on French football. Before the match, the French national anthem was booed. The match was later abandoned after a pitch invasion in the 76th minute. .“We thought that 1998 and 2000 would be the final part of this new France, playing together, winning together, being able to forget about origins,” says Maymon. However, the events that day showed that idea to be a “mirage”, he adds, noting that the national team would later be used by both sides of the political spectrum when debating the issue of immigration. .In 2002, Le Pen unexpectedly advanced to the run-off of the presidential election registering the highest score ever recorded by the French far right. .Maymon says that although the narrative that projected football as the solution to a more inclusive society was politically convenient, it was, in fact, immigration that had “made French football better”. .“In the right-wing of [French] politics, they often say there are no white players, but actually, if we stayed with only white players, we would not have been able to win two World Cups”, he explains, referring to 1998 as well as France’s second World Cup win, four years ago in 2018 in Russia. .He also highlights the Ballon d’Or, a coveted annual football prize, as epitomising French football’s reliance on immigration. Four of France’s five winners are from non-French backgrounds, including Raymond Kopa, the legendary Real Madrid midfielder who came from a family of Polish immigrants; Michel Platini, who is of Italian origin; and Zinedine Zidane and Karim Benzema, who are both of Algerian heritage. .France’s current team, now competing at the Qatar World Cup 2022, is another example of how immigration has shaped French football. Most players in the starting XI have roots from a wide and diverse set of places, including Dayot Upamecano, who is of Bissau-Guinean descent, and Aurelien Tchouameni, who is of Cameroonian descent. .A long and rich history of diversity .The relationship between French football and immigration to the country dates back to the formation of several teams in the first half of the 20th century. These include RC Lens and AS Saint-Etienne, built around close-knit mining communities composed of Polish and Italian immigrants. .One such player was Stefan Dembicki, or Stanis, who holds the record for most goals scored in a professional match in France after netting 16 for RC Lens in a first-round Coupe de France match in 1942. .At the 1938 World Cup held on home soil, France fielded its first Black player, Raoul Diagne, a versatile defender nicknamed “the Black spider” who was born in French Guiana and was of Senegalese descent. .That same year Morocco-born Larbi Benbarek transferred from the club US Marocaine Casablanca to Olympique de Marseille in France, scoring 10 goals in his first season. He would go on to represent his adopted country, France, 19 times and make 113 appearances for the Spanish club Atletico Madrid, where he earned the nickname “the foot of God”. Brazilian superstar Pelé famously said about him, “If I am the king of football, then Larbi Benbarek is the God of it”. . .In the 1950s and 1960s, players who had emigrated from France’s colonies and protectorates in the Maghreb region of north Africa started to impact French football significantly. .Rachid Mekhloufi was one such player. Having just won the French Division 1 in 1956-1957 with AS Saint-Etienne, he was selected to join the French World Cup squad. However, midway through preparations, he fled with several other France-based players of Algerian heritage to Algeria during its War of Independence. There, he played for a team formed by the National Liberation Front (FLN), the armed wing of the Algerian nationalist movement. .When Mekhloufi returned to France after the FLN was disbanded in 1962, he received a heroes’ welcome at Saint-Etienne, a club that Maymon supports and says has always understood the “importance of immigration” in its footballing history. .“Mekhloufi was a hero standing for the independence of his country, but also an immigrant who was able to succeed,” he says. .In the early 1970s, France began to restructure its development system after a decline in performance. The result was a sophisticated academy system that recruited and trained young players, many of whom had grown up in neighbourhoods with a high concentration of immigrants. .Over the following decades, many players with roots in France’s former colonies would go on to represent Les Bleus. They included Marius Tresor, widely considered one of the best defenders of all time, who was born in Guadeloupe, and Amadou Tigana, the renowned midfielder born in Bamako, Mali. .In the 1990s and 2000s, many high-profile players with an immigrant background would establish themselves in the French team, including all-time joint leading goal scorer Thierry Henry, born in the Paris suburb of Les Ulis to parents from Guadeloupe and Martinique. .Today, five of the nine players with more than 100 appearances for France are of non-European heritage. .During the successive waves of migration during the 20th century, French clubs embraced players of colour with differing levels of tolerance, according to Maymon. .Marseille, a port city on France’s south coast, has a long history of immigration, especially from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century and later from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. .This influence has shaped Olympique de Marseille, Maymon says. “You can feel it in the stands; there is never a problem with racism among the fans in Marseille.” .Other clubs, however, have struggled with racist factions among their supporters. PSG, founded in 1970, had struggled with racist hooligan groups that had occupied sections of the so-called Kop of Boulogne stand at the Parc des Princes until 2010, when they were banned from the stadium. .The Paris stadium could be a hostile place for Black players to visit. Patrick Vieira, the former French midfielder of Senegalese descent, referring to his experience at the Parc des Princes once said, “I’d have to think twice before setting foot there again.” .After the World cup success of the Black, Blanc and Beur generation, the France team experienced some tumultuous years, including a player revolt during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. .However, after narrowly losing the 2016 European Championship final to Portugal, France would win the World Cup again in 2018. .Just as it had been 20 years earlier, the France squad was a melting point of different ethnicities, with 17 of the 23 players in the squad eligible to play for at least one other country. .Among them was Kylian Mbappe, who has a father from Cameroon and a mother from Algeria and was voted the best young player of the tournament. Another standout player of the tournament was Paul Pogba, a Muslim with Guinean parents, who, like Mbappe and many other players in the team, had grown up in the suburbs of Paris. .In the international media, the success of the multiethnic French team was widely-covered and, in most cases, celebrated. US-based South African comedian Trevor Noah joked on The Daily Show after France’s victory that “Africa won the World Cup”. .His comments sparked a strongly worded response from French Ambassador Gerard Araud. .“By calling them an African team, it seems you are denying their Frenchness,” Araud said, adding: “This, even in jest, legitimises the ideology which claims whiteness as the only definition of being French.” .The footballing success of second and third-generation immigrants was not confined to the France team. At the same tournament, 28 players born and trained in France were playing for other teams. . .France came to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after a closely contested presidential election race between centrist Emmanuel Macron and nationalist rival Marine Le Pen, the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, earlier in the year. .Le Pen’s campaign centred largely on proposals targeting immigration and Islam, including a proposed ban on Muslim headscarves in public. .Macron eventually won, but Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party, formerly FN, captured 89 seats in the National Assembly, making it the biggest opposition party in the lower house. .As France advance in the tournament, the hope will be that the success of its multiethnic team will distract from the simmering racial tensions that underpinned the presidential race. .However, in the build-up to Qatar 2022, French newspaper Le Canard published a cartoon depicting Qatari footballers as terrorists, sparking outrage on social media, with users calling out its “blatant Islamophobia” and “racism”. .France dismantled Australia 4-1 in their first group-stage game on November 22, followed by a 2-1 victory over Denmark four days later in a game that saw Mbappe score both goals. .In their final group stage game on November 30, France will face Tunisia, a country with several French-born players in their squad, including Naim Sliti and Wahbi Khazri. .French defender Raphael Varane speaking ahead of the match, said, “We have seen that it [Tunisia] is a team capable of hurting us on the counterattack in space, who presses with lots of energy. .“The Tunisians will fight for a victory, and it will be up to us to counter them.”",306

Though the English goal tally was high on Tuesday, the Welsh had defended well in the first half much to the ire of the English attackers. .World Cup hosts Qatar suffered a 2-0 defeat to the Netherlands in a game that was described as barely causing the Dutch to break a sweat. Already eliminated from the tournament following a 3-1 loss to Senegal in their last game, the Qatari team ended their appearance at the tournament with another lacklustre performance. .And it was Senegal who also booked a place in the Round of 16 with a thrilling 2-1 win over Ecuador, which saw the African team finish second in Group A with six points from their three matches and the South American side, with four points, exiting the tournament. .Here is a quick guide recapping all you need to know from day 10 – Tuesday, November 29 – of the Qatar World Cup 2022. .  .The United States team advanced to the World Cup’s Round of 16 on Tuesday by beating Iran 1-0 at Al Thumama Stadium, after Christian Pulisic headed the ball home in a Group B showdown, amid a cloud of controversy and decades of enmity between the two countries. .Pulisic’s 38th-minute goal proved enough for the US side to advance at the expense of their geopolitical rivals in an eagerly awaited rematch of their 1998 World Cup group stage meeting, which Iran had won 2-1. .Sergino Dest headed the ball into the path of the sprinting Pulisic, who swept it into the net, momentarily silencing the raucous Iranian supporters but crashing into the outstretched Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand in the process. .Pulisic was back on his feet after several minutes but he did not look comfortable and was replaced by Brenden Aaronson at the halftime break. He was later treated in hospital for an abdominal injury. .Iran only needed a point to advance but the US had largely restricted the Iranians to playing on the defence and with their win the US has finished two points behind Group B winners England to reach the last 16 for the fifth time since 1994. .“The dream is over with this result,” Iran coach Carlos Queiroz said after the game. “The US started the game much better than us, more quick with better control of the game.” .Two goals by England’s Marcus Rashford and another by Phil Foden saw the team defeat Wales 3-0, advancing the English side to the knockout stage of the 2022 World Cup on Tuesday. As the winner of Group B, England will now face Senegal in the next round on Sunday. .Rashford started the scoring for England with a free kick in the 50th minute and teammate Foden doubled the goal tally a minute later. .Rashford then scored England’s third goal when his shot went through the legs of Wales’s goalkeeper Danny Ward in the 68th minute. .Both Rashford and Foden had come on as substitutes in the opening game with Iran, and Rashford did so again in the match against the US. On Tuesday, England coach Gareth Southgate wisely opted to drop Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling to the bench and give Rashford and Foden a chance from the start. .Meanwhile, Wales captain Gareth Bale was forced off at halftime with an injury. .The Welsh, who needed a four-goal victory to reach the knockout phase, defended deeply and frustrated England in a subdued first half at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. But the Dragons caved in after the halftime break to England and at the final whistle, the Wales players looked crestfallen as their chance at the first World Cup for 64 years fizzled out. .England had seven shots on target to one for Wales, who are now eliminated from the tournament. .“Moments like this, this is what I play football for. The biggest moments, the best moments,” Rashford said after the game. .“It’s disappointing to go out but we will all walk out of that changing room with our heads held high proud of each other,” Bale said after the match. .Dutch star player Cody Gakpo scored this third goal at the World Cup 2022 as the Netherlands qualified for the last 16 as Group A winners with a 2-0 win over eliminated hosts Qatar on Tuesday. .Gakpo scored in the 26th minute followed by teammate Frenkie de Jong’s goal in the 49th minute to cruise past the hosts. Gakpo also had a second goal wiped out after it was determined he handled the ball. .Gakpo also scored in Netherland’s first two games against Ecuador and Senegal. .The Netherlands, a three-time runner-up at the World Cup, will next face the US for a spot in the quarterfinals. .Qatar, who were already eliminated from contention to advance to the next round after their 3-1 loss to Senegal, have not earned a point in this World Cup. .Only the second host country to fail at this stage of the tournament after South Africa in 2010, Qatar were the winners of the 2019 Asian Cup and had wanted to go out on a high on Tuesday, even though a positive result for the Dutch was never really in doubt. .“We have played against a great team. We hung on against them until 1-0. We are out but it was a great experience for my players,” Qatar coach Felix Sanchez said after the match. .“We came here trying to compete and we managed to do that,” Sánchez said, adding that he was not sure about his future status with the team. .“One of the things about our national team is that we have a long-term plan that doesn’t depend on me or anyone else,” Sánchez said. .“We’re going to rest for a few days and we’re going to keep working and planning.” .The Netherlands, which failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, finished with seven points at the top of the group. .Senegal captain Kalidou Koulibaly’s second-half strike earned his team a 2-1 victory over Ecuador on Tuesday and sent the African team into the knockout phase of the World Cup for the second time ever. .Ecuador, who needed a draw to qualify for the last remaining 16, end up third in their group on four points after a game played to the relentless beat of the Senegal fans’ drums. .The African champions had taken the lead after a first-half penalty from Ismaila Sarr. But Ecuador’s Moises Caicedo evened the score when he was left unmarked after a corner kick in the 67th minute, bringing the teams to 1-1. .At 1-1, Ecuador would have advanced to the next round of the World Cup and Senegal was out. But it was not to be. .Koulibaly scored three minutes after Caicedo to push Senegal to 2-1 and through to the next round from Group A. .A free kick from Idrissa Gueye bounced off an opponent and came Koulibaly’s way. He threw out his right foot and hit it past Ecuador goalkeeper Hernan Galindez in the 70th minute. .It was a must-win match for the African champions, and they did not disappoint. .It was also the end of a strong campaign for Ecuador and their striker Enner Valencia, who had scored his team’s first three goals at this year’s World Cup and played against Senegal despite struggling with a bad knee strain. .Valencia was left consoling teammate Galindez, who was tearing up near the end of the game and could not hold back after the final whistle, crying on Valencia’s shoulder. .Senegal will play England in the Round of 16 on Sunday. The Netherlands, which won Group A, will face the US on Saturday. .",307

They pushed forward and won a free kick 30 metres (33 yards) from goal with the South Americans taking the opportunity for a rare breather before captain Enner Valencia slammed the ball into the wall. .After the furious opening exchanges, both sides began to settle before Ecuador defender Piero Hincapie clattered into Sarr, giving referee Clement Turpin no choice but to point to the spot. Sarr stepped up and coolly dispatched a fine spot kick past Galindez, maintaining eye contact with the keeper as the ball went in. . .Ecuador started the second half fresher and more determined, perhaps reassured that the Netherlands’ dominance over Qatar meant they only needed a draw to go through. .From a free kick, defender Felix Torres rose high to head the ball on to Caicedo, who was waiting at the far post and slammed the ball home. .Senegal struck back immediately and in almost identical fashion with Koulibaly lurking unmarked at the far post following a free kick that was deflected into his path by Hincapie. .Coming into the match on a yellow card, Gueye picked up a second-half booking and will miss Senegal’s last-16 game against the winners of Group B, which is currently topped by England. .Iran, the USA and Wales currently occupy the group’s second, third and fourth places, respectively.",314

Qatar was making its tournament debut and will now go back to planning the future of the game in the country. .",315

318,Published On 29 Nov 2022,World Cup: African fans in Qatar confident teams will advance,"After stellar performances by Ghana and Cameroon, fans see their teams going through to the next World Cup stage.",".Doha, Qatar – African fans in the Qatari capital turned up their celebrations by a few notches on Monday evening after two high-scoring thrillers brought their teams closer to the round of 16 in the World Cup. .Cameroon started the party following a 3-3 draw against a tough Serbian side. Ghana joined in later with a 3-2 win over South Korea in a match that kept fans out of their seats until the referee blew the full-time whistle. .Africa was the theme of the night’s festivities at the FIFA Fan Festival where fans gather to watch matches and performances. Popular Nigerian singer Patoranking was the headline act who enthralled the crowd with some of his hit songs as performers from Kenya put on a dance show. .It was a double treat for fans who had been entertained by the football earlier that day. .Ghana supporters Ekow and Simone were at the Education City Stadium for the match against South Korea and said the atmosphere during the game was electric. .“We cheered, we cried, we laughed and when it was all over, we danced,” Ekow told Al Jazeera at the FIFA Fan Festival on Monday night. “It was perfect.” .Ekow said the performance of all African teams has shown that the continent needs more representation at the tournament, referring to how it only has five berths in the World Cup. .“At least four teams of Africa have a very good chance of going through, which shows that we are as good as European and South American teams,” he said. .Leading up to the last day of group-stage matches, all five teams from Africa have a chance of progressing to the knockout stages, starting Saturday. And they are no strangers to pulling off upsets and exceeding expectations. .Cameroon (1990), Ghana (2010) and Senegal (2002) have all previously progressed to the quarter-finals and this World Cup, their fans do not expect anything less from them. .Richard, a Senegalese fan, said he fully expects his side to beat Ecuador in their last group match today. .“Ecuador are good but Senegal have a history of beating good teams,” he said, referring to Senegal’s run at the 2002 tournament, where they beat defending champions France and drew against Denmark and Uruguay. .“Don’t call it an upset if we beat Ecuador. We deserve to go through.”",318

The Netherlands need only a draw or win to progress to the knockout stages for the 11th time after a 2-0 win over Senegal and a 1-1 draw with Ecuador. They could still finish at the top of Group A. .Not much is on the line for Qatar — but they could possibly spoil things for the Dutch, only if the team can overcome their stage fright. .Another loss on Tuesday would see the first host team in history go winless through the World Cup’s group stages. .Speaking of firsts, it’s worth noting, the Dutch have yet to win a World Cup after finishing runner-up in 1974, 1978 and 2010. .Lead Netherlands attacker Memphis Depay will likely be starting for the first time in the 2022 World Cup following a hamstring injury that left him sidelined for two months. He made second-half appearances against Senegal and Ecuador. .Netherlands player Cody Gakpo, who found the back of the goal in the first two World Cup matches, is also hoping for an improved performance against Qatar. .“I know what I’m capable of, but it’s always a challenge to reach your highest level that’s possible. And I think I’m not there yet. I think I can improve in a lot of things,” Gakpo said. .Ghana-born Mohammed Muntari made history last week when he netted Qatar’s first World Cup goal. Unfortunately, Muntari’s conversion has been his team’s only goal of the tournament. .Look for how Gulf legends, including Qatari captain Hassan al-Haydos, control the ball. .Ecuador, playing in their fourth World Cup, are on the brink of sealing their place in the final 16 for the second time in history if they can take down Senegal on Tuesday at Khalifa International Stadium. .A draw will also get them there. A loss, on the other hand, will almost surely spell a premature departure from Qatar for the young and hungry South American team, unless Qatar stages an unlikely lopsided win against the Netherlands. .“We have a bigger battle coming,” coach Gustavo Alvaro said after drawing 1-1 against the Dutch, in which Ecuador were the better team. .Senegal, too, are looking to punch a ticket to the World Cup’s knockout stages — a win over Ecuador would guarantee their spot. A draw could be enough to propel them to the final 16, but only if Qatar are able to beat the Netherlands by two goals or more. .“Our concentration must be better,” said Senegal coach Aliou Cisse. “We need to win to have a chance to qualify for the last 16.” .Enner Valencia’s simmering hot streak continues. The star forward, Ecuador’s all-time leading scorer, has scored the last six goals for his team — in Qatar and stretching back to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. .Valencia caused panic after he was taken off the field late in the match against the Netherlands due to a knee strain he sustained in the inaugural match with Qatar. .“He’s the only one with World Cup experience,” Ecuador’s manager Alfaro said. “The rest are kids.” .  .Wales face slim odds at making it to the knockout stage after a stunning 2-0 loss to Iran and a 1-1 stalemate with the United States, as they head into their final Group B match with rivals England, who are fresh off a 0-0 draw with the USA and a 6-2 thumping of Iran. .Late to the party, first to leave? Wales, playing in their first World Cup in 64 years, have struggled to make a dent in their group at Qatar. A loss to England will send the team packing. .History isn’t on the Welsh side either; England has bested Wales in their last six contests. Most recently, Wales fell 3-0 to England in a friendly exhibition match in 2020. .The two teams have played a total of 103 matches since first squaring off in 1879. England has been victorious in 68 of those games, losing just 14 matches to the Welsh. Of those matches, 21 resulted in draws. .If Wales can pull out a win on Tuesday, it will be their first over England since 1984; even then, Wales’s hopes of qualifying for the knockout round would rest on the outcome between the USA and Iran in a separate fixture. .“It’s a tough task, it’s always uncomfortable when it’s obviously not in your hands and you’re relying on certain things to unfold,” Wales midfielder Joe Allen said. “But whilst there’s still a chance, it’s really simple for us. We’re fully motivated, we’ll sacrifice absolutely everything into getting a win. .England can advance to the round of 16 with a draw. A win, though, would cement their top place in Group B. They’ll advance as long as they can hold off a four-goal loss from Wales. They’d face a Group A challenger in either the Netherlands, Ecuador or Senegal in the knockout stage. .“When you win a game, you are the best team in the world. When you lose, you are the worst. That’s football. As players you have to keep a balance,” England forward Marcus Rashford said, swatting back criticism of his teams’ 1-1 draw with the USA. .  .Star Welsh players Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey have failed to deliver thus far in Qatar. They will be eager to redeem themselves — and find the scoresheet — on Tuesday. Bale mustered just one shot on the net against Iran. .Yet Bale remains the lone Welsh player to have ever tallied a goal versus England in the 21st century when he converted a 2-1 losing effort at the 2016 Euros. .Phil Foden was called “the best footballer England have” by ex-Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney, who voiced dismay that the 22-year-old had been passed over for starting roles in the first two matches. .“I think if you have a talent like Foden, you simply have to play him,” Rooney wrote in his column for The Times. “He is now a different player from the one we saw at Euro 2020, when he struggled to make an impact.” .The USA is faced with an ultimatum on Tuesday: topple Iran, or go bust. .“It sets up our first knockout game of the World Cup,” USA coach Gregg Berhalter said. “We win or we’re out of the World Cup.” .The match favourite USA, who sit third in their group with two points and a 0-0-2 record, are still in search of their first win in Qatar following two consecutive draws — 1-1 and 0-0 finishes over Wales and England, respectively. .Iran, meanwhile, have never rocketed out of the group stage at a World Cup. The Iranians rebounded with a 2-0 win over Wales following their massive 6-2 loss to England. .Tuesday’s match marks only the second time the two nations have faced off at a World Cup. Iran trumped the USA by a slim 2-1 margin in 1998; the match, a seismic blow to the USA men’s football programme, was defined by building political friction between the two nations. .Prior to Tuesday’s match, the US Soccer Federation reignited geopolitical tensions when it momentarily displayed the Iranian national flag on social media. The emblem of the Islamic Republic had been scrubbed from the flag, with the US stating it supported demonstrators in Iran, where protests have been raging following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September while in police custody. .“We wanted to show our support for the women in Iran with our graphic for 24 hours,” the federation stated. .In response, Iran’s government blasted the US, accusing American football officials of removing the name of God from its national flag. .  .All eyes will be on “Captain America” Christian Pulisic — the most expensive American footballer in history — to carry the team into the knockout stages. .Wales and England held the Chelsea all-star at bay but can Iran contain him?",319
320,Published On 29 Nov 2022,Fans say Iran vs USA game an opportunity for ‘stronger bonds’,"For two fans at the World Cup, football is a reminder that individuals are more than the countries they come from.",".Doha, Qatar – Political tensions have been high between the United States and Iran for more than half a century, but to some football fans gearing up to watch the two nations face off at the World Cup, the beautiful game rises above politics. .American-Iranian Shervin Sharifi, 31, is a die-hard football fan who collects football shirts as a hobby. His collection so far spans 107 shirts, from various clubs to national teams. Approximately 40 to 45 of those are from the Iranian national team alone. .“You can say that I am kind of addicted. This is my life. This is what I live for,” Sharifi told Al Jazeera, his voice already coarse from three days of cheering at the games. .He and his friends travelled from Dallas, Texas, to support “Team Melli”, the Iranian national team, including at the USA vs Iran match on Tuesday, where the stakes could not be higher. .After Iran’s 2-0 win over Wales and the 0-0 tie between the USA and England, the Americans need to win tonight’s match to advance to the knock-out stages of the tournament, while the Iranians may only need a draw. Only one of them can go through from Group B. This will be the second time the two teams face off in a World Cup. .“I can tell you this for sure — the Iranian players have more passion for this game because they’re not just playing for themselves to be a success; they have 80 million people to make happy at home. That’s a lot of weight on your shoulders,” he told Al Jazeera while standing in Doha’s Souq Waqif market. .Sharifi said that he recognised that the game represents more than just football for many and that there have been protests during games and elsewhere. .“I’m not saying [the USA team] is not as passionate, but [it’s been] 43 years of this kind of a stranglehold on a country,” he said, referring to the Islamic Republic coming into power following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. .“When [the Iranian team] steps on that field, they’re not just playing for a game. They’re playing for change.” .For Sharifi, the match between the US and Iran holds a special significance since he first fell in love with football when the two teams faced off during the 1998 World Cup match in Lyon, France. He remembers watching Iran beat the US team 2-1 when he was seven with his father, who immigrated from Iran with his mother. .That match has been described as the most politically charged match in the history of the World Cup due to the hostile geopolitical relations between the two countries. .Sharifi said his father “cared more [about] the political side of the football match, and that’s what made me excited. But it didn’t matter to me. I was very young. All I saw was 11 men on the field, and it blew my mind.” .Ahead of the match in 1998, tensions could not have been higher. Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei even threatened to pull the team out of the game as he did not want the players shaking hands with the US team as protocol dictates. .But the players took a different approach. Both teams posed for an improvised photo together on the field — an iconic moment — and the Iranian players gave bouquets of white flowers to their opponents as a symbol of peace. .“Looking back at 1998, that was a unifying moment bringing the Iran and US together,” Sharifi said. .A lot has changed since that World Cup game, and ahead of Tuesday’s match, the focus of tensions in Iran has spread beyond concerns with the US. .For weeks, protests have been ongoing in Iran over the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested in September for “unsuitable attire”. .Children have been among more than a dozen people killed this month in a surge of protests. .In Iran’s first game against England, the team did not sing the national anthem, which was interpreted as a gesture of support for the protests. .During their second match against Wales, the team did sing the anthem but in a reserved manner, as Al Jazeera’s Maziar Motamedi reported. .“Team Melli is a way for us to bring a spotlight to this issue … the moment that the Iranian national team did not sing the national anthem, everybody was reporting it,” Sharifi said. .Vignesh Ram, 37, an American-Canadian who travelled from the San Francisco Bay Area, is in Qatar with his father to cheer for the US team. .Ram believes that football can be a unifying force and is not focused on the political tensions between the two countries. .“For US fans of football, travelling internationally gives an opportunity to gain many more perspectives,” he said. “It brings people together in a way that’s truly meaningful, and the [US] team has never been great, so there’s less to lose. There’s less national pride on the line.” .“I actually think it’s a better opportunity to forge stronger bonds.” .Ram sees these games as an opportunity to understand what people who are not from the US are going through daily. .“Football reminds us that countries are not their governments, and they are in fact their people,” he said. “I think we see this constantly during this tournament, especially with many controversies surrounding it. You see the ways players have engaged in different forms of protests.” .Sharifi from Dallas agrees that football can encourage empathy but admits that it is difficult not to connect national teams to the politics of their countries. .“People are not just coming for football now; that’s a thing of the past. It has a political contingent with it,” he said, adding that he believes something positive can come from these political attachments to the game. .“US fans are going to be sympathetic to the Iranian people because, at the end of the day, the Iranian people are not the Iranian government.”",320
321,Published On 29 Nov 2022,Iran vs USA: Why is it hard to focus on just the football?,The stakes for what happens after tonight’s match are very high as a win will catapult Iran into the elimination stage for the first time in history.,".Tehran, Iran – It is Iran versus the United States in the Qatar World Cup 2022 on Tuesday. .There’s survival at stake. But for the majority of the millions tuning in across Iran, it will be difficult to focus on just the football. The reason is not just the sour political relations between the two countries. .The two sides last met during the 1998 World Cup in France. That was the first match they played against each other since Tehran and Washington cut ties after Iran’s 1979 revolution. .But any concerns of tensions showing on the pitch dissipated after the Iranian players handed bouquets of white roses to their opponents and both sides had a group photo taken. .There were celebrations on the streets of Tehran when goals by Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia secured a 2-1 win. That was also Iran’s first win at a World Cup match. .On Friday, Iran beat Wales in dramatic fashion. It gave the players a much-needed boost after suffering a 6-2 thrashing in their opener against England. .A win over the US would help the team move to the knockouts for the first time ever. .But the players and the management know it is not all about football. .Iran continues to be gripped by protests that began more than 70 days ago, during which more than 400 people, including more than 60 children, have been killed, according to human rights organisations. .Iranian authorities have not released official figures. .The protests began after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died following her arrest by the country’s morality police for allegedly not adhering to a mandatory dress code. .Protests that still bear her name and the slogan “woman, life, freedom” have made their way into the World Cup as well. .Some Iranians expected Team Melli players to join other current and former athletes and use their high profile at the biggest international football theatre to express unequivocal support for the protests. .Captain Ehsan Hajisafi implicitly expressed solidarity with the protests during a news conference in Doha last week. The players refused to sing along with the national anthem ahead of the opener against England. .But their rhetoric has been focused solely on football since, and they sang the anthem ahead of the Wales match. .There were calls for street protests in Iran following the England match. But demonstrations were very limited amid a heavy presence by security forces and a severe slowdown in internet connections that came on top of significant internet restrictions that have been in place since shortly after the protests began. .After the win against Wales, there were street celebrations supported and encouraged by security forces. .The same police in riot gear that have become a familiar sight during the crackdown on protests were this time filmed waving flags, riding their motorcycles, and even playing music in the streets. State-affiliated news websites published images of cheering women without the mandatory headscarf in a big break with their policies during normal times. .And authorities continue to focus their rhetoric on the importance of using Iran’s current national flag as protesters abroad display flags used before the revolution during demonstrations in a show of defiance. .Iran on Monday lodged a complaint to FIFA over the removal of the word “Allah” from the Islamic Republic’s flag on social media posts by the US, which the latter admitted came as a show of support for the protests. .Meanwhile, Iran’s top officials continue to publicly accuse the US of being the main driving force behind “riots” and “terrorism” in the country, something Washington has denied.",321
322,Published On 29 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: England v Wales match preview,,".Who: England vs Wales, Group B .Where: Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium .When: Tuesday, November 29, 10pm local (19:00 GMT) .FIFA rankings: England (5), Wales (19) .If you think the USA vs Iran game will be politically charged, you just wait for this one — which kicks off at the same time as the match between the geopolitical rivals. .The only two non-autonomous countries in this World Cup are neighbours — of the kind where the seat of power of one resides in the other. Since England’s King Edward invaded and colonised Wales in 1282, constructing a “Ring of Iron” of castles to house his occupying army and to project power and control over the Indigenous population, there have been uprisings and rebellions in Wales to wrestle control and return sovereignty to the Welsh. .It is not all ancient history, either. In the 1960s, a valley of Welsh-speaking villages in North Wales was chosen to be flooded, building a reservoir to supply drinking water, not to the people of Wales but to the city of Liverpool. .Musician Dafydd Iwan, later the president of Welsh pro-independence party Plaid Cymru, was among dozens of people jailed in the 1970s for Welsh-language activism. Ten years later, he composed Yma o Hyd, a rebel song describing the efforts to destroy Welsh national identity and its language. Its title translates as “We’re still here”, and it now rings out from the terraces when Wales take to the field. The Welsh language was only officially recognised by Westminster’s Parliament in 1993. .This is the first World Cup for which Wales have qualified since 1958. The Welsh football team play with a dragon on their chest. The Welsh rugby team play with the symbol of the prince of Wales on theirs. The title of “prince of Wales”, by the way, is not hereditary, but appointed by the British monarch, ever since Owain Glyndwr, the last Welsh prince of Wales, led a 15-year rebellion against the British monarchy and established an independent parliament for Wales in 1404. .Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles appointed his son William to the role he formerly held. William, Prince of Wales, has announced that, as president of the English Football Association, he will be supporting England at the World Cup. It is no coincidence that the success of the national football team since Euro 2016 — where Wales reached the semi-finals — has coincided with a resurgence in independence sentiment. .But this golden generation, featuring superstar Gareth Bale alongside Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey, is coming towards the inevitable twilight of their careers. Bale and Ramsey struggle to get game time in the warm climes of Los Angeles and Nice, respectively. Allen is only just back from injury. .The opening draw with the USA, in which Wales were reliant on a Bale penalty, and the loss to Iran, in which a lack of discipline left them exposed defensively, revealed a team scrabbling for composure and cohesion. To qualify now, Wales need to beat England, and hope the USA draw with Iran. .England, meanwhile, are flying high: Euro 2020 finalists, ranked fifth in the world, and considered a serious contender for the title in Qatar. They have practically qualified for the Round of 16 already — only a four-goal margin of defeat at Welsh hands would stop them. .Yet they too have not been as imperious as some had expected. A draw with the USA was not what the tabloids back home were crying out for. But English manager Gareth Southgate — born in Watford, where Welsh manager Robert Page captained the football team in the 1990s — knows that the World Cup is a long tournament and is not won in the group stage. .Headlines howl at the lack of Phil Foden on the pitch, but Southgate knows that he does not need the mercurial Manchester City midfielder to get out of Group B. Foden will make an appearance exactly when England need him. .Harry Kane’s leadership on and off the field is well-known. And he’s not alone. Marcus Rashford, whose campaign for free school meals forced a government U-turn to feed nearly two million children in need, also commands respect. They lead an England attack that includes Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling — all prodigious talents. .England should win this game; they want that second star on their shirt. For Wales, this World Cup is less about pretensions of grandeur and more about the pride that comes from taking one’s rightful place among a community of nations after so long. And when they come home — whenever that is — the schoolchildren will still be singing Yma o Hyd, “We’re still here”.",322

We remain calm but that doesn’t mean we are overconfident, we are not triumphalist,” he said. .“We have our own way of playing, we are not just thinking of getting a draw. We have to come to the pitch trying to win the game … We are creating our own pathway. We want to progress, we want to seal our passage, we want to play the best World Cup in Ecuadorean history.” .However, one area of concern for the South Americans is the fitness of captain Enner Valencia after he was carried off late in the Netherlands draw with a recurrence of a knee strain. The 33-year-old forward has scored all three of Ecuador’s goals in Qatar, adding to the three he bagged in Brazil in 2014. .Senegal, for their part, will almost certainly need to beat Ecuador at the Khalifa International Stadium to qualify for the last 16. .Coach Aliou Cisse’s side lost 2-0 to the Dutch before beating Qatar 3-1 on Friday to keep their hopes of advancing alive. .They could theoretically remain in contention for the knockout phase with a draw, but that outcome would be contingent on hosts Qatar registering a highly unlikely victory over the Netherlands, who sit joint-top of Group A with Ecuador. .Cisse said on Monday that his side is expected to qualify from the group due to their status as the best side in Africa, but added his players were adapting to the pressure well. .Having reached the quarter-finals on their World Cup debut in 2002, Senegal were eliminated in the group stage on fair play points four years ago in Russia. .“I come from a country where we don’t like losing … we’re always hungry for that win [and] not going to the round of 16 would be difficult to digest,” Cisse told reporters. “We’re okay, we’re dealing with the pressure and stress. For me, it’s good stress.”",323

When you come here you need to know where you’re coming from [as a country]. If this is a failure and disappointment, that depends on expectations,” Sanchez told reporters on Saturday. .“We are aware of how tough this competition is. We wanted to go far but we know we had limitations as a country,” Sanchez said. .The Orange, ranked eighth, are aiming to better their previous World Cup records.

325,Published On 29 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Iran vs USA match preview,"Only one of them can go through from Group B, in a football match that is inevitably being viewed through the prism of politics.",".Who: Iran vs USA .Where: Al Thumama Stadium in Al Thumama, Qatar .When: Tuesday, November 29 at 10pm (19:00 GMT) .FIFA ranking: Iran (20), USA (16) .A grudge match between Iran and the USA, two countries divided by politics and a history of enmity, brought together by the World Cup draw for a rare matchup, in a game seized upon by partisans on both sides to denounce their opponent. .That was how the game was billed at the 1998 World Cup, when Iran went on to win 2-1 over the Americans. And while some supporters of Iran’s government used the win as evidence of their country’s inevitable victory over the “Great Satan”, it was also seen by others as an opportunity to show that the beautiful game could overcome divisions, emblemised by a pre-match photo with players from both teams intermingled amongst each other. .Fast forward to 2022, and the two have been drawn together again in the group stage. The political divide is still there – and if anything, it’s more entrenched. .Iran and the USA can’t find agreement on a nuclear deal, leaving the former under the latter’s sanctions. Anti-government protests in Iran have attracted the world’s attention and the condemnation of the United States government. The Iranians accuse the Americans of being among those behind the protests. .And even since the World Cup began, there have been controversies. Iran has asked for the USA to be thrown out of the tournament after a US Soccer social media post used an altered version of the Iranian flag. And the former USA manager, the German Jurgen Klinsmann, has angered Iran by saying that unsportsmanlike behaviour was part of Iran’s “culture” while speaking to the BBC. .Iranian fans, for their part, are still divided over whether to even support the team, in light of the protests calling for women’s rights in Iran. Some in the anti-government camp fear that an Iranian victory over the USA will be used by the government for propaganda. .All of that, and we haven’t even got to the footballing permutations of this game. .Barring what would be a surprise victory for Wales in their game against England, the USA has to win to go through to the World Cup’s knock-out stages, while the Iranians only need a draw. .That puts Iran’s manager Carlos Queiroz in a bind. Play to his own defensive instincts, and go for the draw, while betting on the English avoiding a loss? Or play to Iran’s attacking strengths, with star strikers Sardar Azmoun and Mehdi Taremi up top? Both of them can be deadly. Taremi already has two goals in the World Cup, and has scored five goals in five games for his club, FC Porto, in the Champions League this season. .As happy as the Americans will have been with their performance against England on Friday, where they held the higher-ranked side to a draw, this will be a different type of game, and they will be forced to take the game to the Iranians. The hope will be that the USA central midfield of Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and the particularly impressive Yunus Musah will be able to repeat their performance against England, when they largely won the battle in the middle of the park and repeatedly turned the ball over to allow Christian Pulisic to run at England’s defence. .The manner in which the USA kept England quiet compared to the English thumping of Iran in the opening round of fixtures will give the Americans the confidence that they can beat the Iranians. But Iran’s win against Wales appears to be a truer reflection of their abilities than the humiliation against England. .And with the Americans forced to chase a goal to have any hope of going through, the USA defence will have to keep Azmoun and Taremi quiet – which will be easier said than done. Leaving the geopolitics aside even for 90 minutes? That might be even harder.",325
326,Published On 29 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: A brief history of US-Iran relations,"As the US meets Iran in a critical World Cup match in Qatar, Al Jazeera looks at the volatile history between the two nations.",".Washington, DC – An Arabic saying goes, “Politics has never touched anything that it did not spoil.” .But it has been nearly impossible to keep politics out of football ahead of a critical showdown between Iran and the United States at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar on Tuesday. .With qualification to the knockout stage on the line for both teams, fans and organisers are hoping for an amicable game at Al Thumama Stadium to show the uniting power of the beautiful game. .Yet tensions already flared in the lead-up to the decisive Group B match, with Iran’s football federation submitting a complaint to FIFA against the US Soccer Federation (USSF) over the removal of the word “Allah” from the country’s flag in a now-deleted social media post. .The episode is the latest in years of growing hostility between the two countries. Here, Al Jazeera looks at the history of US-Iran relations, what issues lay at the heart of the disagreements, and how the World Cup fits into the fray. .Most experts say the roots of the Washington-Tehran rivalry can be traced back to the 1953 overthrow of democratically-elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in a CIA-orchestrated coup after he tried to nationalise the country’s oil industry. .In 2013, the CIA confirmed its involvement in the putsch, which restored the monarchical rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had been losing an internal power struggle to Mossadegh. .“The coup was the beginning of a sequence of tragedies that dog the US and its allies in the Middle East today,” former CIA operative Robert B Baer said at that time. .“It was the key source of the anti-American resentment that exploded during the Iranian Revolution of 1979,” said Baer, author of The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower. .With the Western-backed Pahlavi tightening his autocratic grip on power in Tehran, Iran and the US enjoyed more than two decades of close official ties. .Then the Islamic Revolution broke out in 1979, changing the course of history in the region and beyond. .Pahlavi was overthrown and his US-friendly monarchy was replaced by a theocratic government sceptical of Washington as the leading Western power that backed the shah. .After being forced to abandon his throne, Pahlavi initially fled to Egypt, but months later, he made it to the US, where he underwent cancer treatment. .Although Washington said at that time that it admitted the deposed monarch on “humanitarian” grounds, Pahlavi’s arrival in the US set in motion a series of events that would turn the two countries into sworn enemies. .Iranian students who supported the Islamic Revolution took over the US embassy in Tehran in late 1979, taking 52 American diplomats and citizens hostage for 444 days. .In April 1980, then-US President Jimmy Carter cut Washington’s diplomatic ties with Tehran during the hostage crisis, and relations have not been restored since. .The animosity between Washington and Tehran worsened in 1980 as the Iran-Iraq war broke out; the US covertly supported Baghdad in the conflict, which would go on for eight years and claim hundreds of thousands of lives. .Throughout the 1980s, the US and Iran remained locked in an indirect confrontation. .In 1983, more than 240 US service members were killed in a suicide attack on a US Marine barracks in Beirut. Although no one took responsibility for the bombing, over the years many US politicians have linked the incident to early operatives of Lebanese group Hezbollah, backed by Iran. .The US added Iran to its list of “State Sponsors of Terrorism” in 1984. .Amid tensions in the Gulf, the US Navy shot down an Iranian civilian plane in 1988, killing all 290 people onboard in what Washington called at that time a “terrible human tragedy”. .Still, with the end of the Iran-Iraq war that year, US-Iranian ties became somewhat dormant during the 1990s. .Active tensions subsided with the rise of reformist Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who told CNN in 1998 that the “American civilisation is worthy of respect”. .During a World Cup game in France between the US and Iran that year, Iranian players gifted white roses to their American counterparts ahead of the match. The Iranians won 2-1. .The September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City and Washington, DC, which prompted then-President George W Bush to launch his “war on terror“, marked another turn in the history of the Middle East and the US-Iran rivalry. .The subsequent US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq brought American forces to two countries bordering Iran, and Bush labelled Tehran a member of the so-called “Axis of Evil” alongside North Korea and Iraq. .After it became known in the early 2000s that Iran was substantially developing its shah-era nuclear programme, the issue became a main point of contention between Tehran and Washington. .Although Iran maintained that it was not seeking a nuclear weapon, the US started moblising the international community to impose sanctions on Iran over the nuclear programme. .The sanctions would continue even as President Barack Obama replaced Bush in 2009, and as Iranian hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was succeeded by the more moderate Hassan Rouhani in 2013. .Obama and Rouhani held an historic phone call after the Iranian leader’s election victory – and a once-unthinkable diplomatic breakthrough followed in 2015. .The US and Iran – along with other major, international players – signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which saw Tehran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of sanctions against its economy. .But Obama faced an unprecedented campaign by conservatives and US-based allies of Israel, who pushed to undermine it. In a breach of diplomatic protocol, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech to Congress in 2015, warning against the accord. .And so, nixing the agreement became a core element of the Republican platform in the 2016 US elections. As President Donald Trump ascended to the White House in early 2017, it took him less than two years to withdraw Washington from the deal and start a “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions against Iran. .In response, Tehran started escalating its nuclear programme well beyond the limits set by the JCPOA, sending regional tensions soaring even further. .The US and Iran came to the verge of an all-out conflict in early 2020 as a Trump-authorised bombing killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, following a deadly rocket attack in Iraq that Washington blamed on Iran-backed groups. .Iran responded by bombing bases hosting US troops in Iraq. And amid the heightened tensions at that time, Tehran said its forces mistakenly shot down a civilian airliner over the country’s capital, killing 176 people. .President Joe Biden would take office nearly a year later, promising to revive the JCPOA. .However, numerous rounds of indirect talks between US and Iranian diplomats have failed to chart a path back into the agreement. At various points, a deal appeared within reach, but it never materialised. .In the meantime, the Biden administration continued to enforce the Trump-era “maximum pressure” campaign. Now, after nuclear negotiations came to a halt earlier this year, ongoing anti-government protests in Iran have further complicated the prospect of diplomacy. .The death in Iranian police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who was arrested in September in Tehran for “unsuitable attire”, has unleashed a wave of public anger and demonstrations across Iran, as well as global condemnation. .In response, the US has announced several rounds of sanctions against Iranian officials accused of cracking down on the demonstrators. .The war in Ukraine has further inflamed US-Iran tensions, with Washington accusing Tehran of providing Moscow with drones used in deadly attacks across Ukraine. .Against this backdrop, it is unlikely that Tuesday’s match between the US and Iran will have a substantial impact on the complicated relationship between the two nations. .Nevertheless, some are hoping that it will showcase football’s ability to transcend politics – and potentially bring people together.",326
327,Published On 29 Nov 2022,"World Cup recap, Day 9: Brazil, Portugal advance to last-16","Cameroon and Serbia in 6-goal stunner, South Korea gutted by Ghana’s victory, Brazil beats Switzerland, and Portugal wins over Uruguay.",".Day nine of the World Cup in Qatar has witnessed some of the most dramatic matches so far, with Cameroon making a stunning comeback in a battle with Serbia where six goals were scored and still neither side emerged victorious, the teams having to settle for a 3-3 draw. .A heartbroken South Korean team left the pitch on Tuesday — with some players in tears — after their 3-2 defeat to Ghana in a game where the Koreans threw everything at the Ghanaian’s goal in the second half but could not break through their defences. .The frustration felt by the team on the pitch spilled onto the sidelines, where the South Korean manager received a red card after a final-whistle tirade against the referee. .Brazil beat Switzerland 1-0 in a match win that guarantees the Brazilians a place in the knockout stages of the football World Cup in Qatar. The win at Stadium 974 means Brazil, already five-time world champions, have now qualified comfortably for the Round of 16 and with a game against Cameroon still to play in their group stage of the tournament. .Portugal’s 2-0 victory over Uruguay also puts them through to the last 16 of the World Cup with a group game to spare. .Here is a quick guide recapping all you need to know from day nine — Monday, November 28 — of the Qatar World Cup 2022. .In a match described as the most exciting game of the World Cup in Qatar so far, six goals were scored when Cameroon and Serbia faced off on Monday. That excitement surged when Cameroon staged an impressive comeback to finish with a 3-3 draw against Serbia in a game that saw Cameroon replace their goalkeeper Andre Onana at the very last minute. .Cameroon’s Coach Rigobert Song said he dropped his starting goalkeeper for “disciplinary reasons”, but did not give further details and replaced Onana with Devis Epassy, who was making just his sixth international appearance. .The inauspicious start did not detract from what would be a thrilling game and a surprise six-goal draw. .Cameroon took the lead in the first half through central defender Jean-Charles Castelletto’s 29th-minute tap-in but then conceded two goals to the Serbians in quick succession. .Serbia’s Strahinja Pavlovic’s was the first, heading in a free kick to level the score before Sergej Milinkovic-Savic struck from 20 metres (66 feet) just two minutes later. Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic made it 3-1 at the start of the second half after Serbia opened Cameroon’s defence with a series of quick passes. .Cameroon was down 3-1, but second-half substitute Vincent Aboubakar turned the dramatic game with a goal and an assist. He lobbed Serbia goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic in the 64th minute to score his 34th goal for the Indomitable Lions, and he then set up striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting two minutes later for the 3-3 equaliser. .“The lion roared today,” Aboubakar said after the match. “I dedicate this result to the squad, and to the people of Cameroon.” .But the result suits neither side. Both sides lost their opening games, with Serbia beaten 2-0 by Brazil and Cameroon losing 1-0 to Switzerland. .Cameroon and Serbia each have one point after two Group G matches, two points behind Switzerland after the Swiss lost 1-0 to Brazil later on Monday. That win by Brazil — the record five-time World Cup champions — sent them into the Round of 16 and still with a match to spare. .Switzerland now needs a win in their last match against Serbia to be guaranteed a spot in the next stage. A draw may be enough, but that will depend on the outcome of the match between Brazil and Cameroon on Friday. Serbia will also likely need a win if they hope to advance. .“We were not smart enough to finish the match to our own advantage,” Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic said later. .Five-time World Cup champions Brazil overcame the absence of their injured star player Neymar to beat Switzerland 1-0 with a late goal on Monday and, in doing so, made it to the tournament’s Round of 16 with a match to spare in Group G. .Casemiro got the only goal in the 83rd minute of a game in which Brazil had difficulties creating scoring chances without its main striker Neymar. Casemiro, a defensive midfielder, scored with a shot into the far corner of the Swiss side’s goal, using the outside of his right foot for a shot that deflected slightly off defender Manuel Akanji. .It was an even match early on in the game, with both teams trying to control the ball but not creating many significant chances. Without Neymar, Brazil struggled to get near Switzerland’s goal until Casemiro took his shot. The assists came from Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, the Real Madrid players who until recently had Casemiro as their teammate. Casemiro now plays for Manchester United. .Vinicius Junior had thought he had given Brazil the lead with a shot from inside the penalty area after a pass by Casemiro in the 64th, but a video review determined there was offside in the build-up. Few had noticed it until the VAR call was announced at Stadium 974. .“Of course we miss a player like Neymar,” Tite said after the match. .“The team loses a lot without him. But we also have other players who can get the job done, as we saw it today,” he said. .Monday’s win gave Brazil six points from two matches, leaving Switzerland with three. Serbia and Cameroon, which drew 3-3 earlier Monday, have one point each. .Switzerland coach Murat Yakin said his team have done a “good job for quite some time”. .“I don’t think it’s a disappointment. We have a lot of good takeaways here. The next game is something we have control over,” he said. .Switzerland, which had no attempts on goal during the match, now needs a win in their last game against Serbia to be guaranteed a spot in the Round of 16. A draw may be enough depending on the match between Brazil and Cameroon on Friday. .  .Two goals from Portugal’s Bruno Fernandes sent his team through to the last 16 of the World Cup on Monday after a 2-0 win over a lacklustre Uruguay. .Fernandes scored with a cross intended for Cristiano Ronaldo that sailed fortuitously into the net in the 54th minute. He then converted a penalty in stoppage time to put his side into the group of 16 knockout stage with a match remaining. .Portugal had the lion’s share of the possession and dominated for most of the match, but struggled to create clear-cut chances until the second half in a game where Uruguay looked sluggish and off form. .Ronaldo set the tone for the match with some early showboating when he used a shoulder to redirect a long throw into the path of William Carvalho, whose powerful volley sailed over the bar. .Portugal looked threatening but struggled to create goal-scoring chances in the first half. .And it was Uruguay who had the best shot in the 32nd minute of the first half when Rodrigo Bentancur picked up the ball and ran half the length of the field, skipping around three defenders before firing off a low shot that was blocked by the advancing Portugal keeper Diogo Costa. .Bentancur was at the centre of the action again a few minutes later when his outstretched leg met a cross from the left from Mathias Olivera, trickling through to Darwin Nunez, who failed to convert from close range. .Portugal finally broke the deadlock when Fernandes’s cross floated past Uruguayan goalkeeper Sergio Rochet, who was rooted to the spot as Cristiano Ronaldo rose to head the ball and initially celebrated the goal as his. .A grinning Ronaldo threw his arms in the air, suggesting he got the final touch, and was embracing Fernandes as multiple close-up replays were being shown on the big screens in Lusail Stadium. .Alas for Ronaldo, the goal wound up being awarded to Fernandes, who added a second from the penalty spot in stoppage time after a handball by Uruguay’s Jose Maria Gimenez. .Uruguay had a brief rally to try to get back into the match after a raft of substitutions, with Facundo Pellistri making an instant impact, Luis Suarez coming close, and Maxi Gomez hitting the post. .But the match belonged to Portugal and Fernandes, who coolly converted a penalty in stoppage time after a handball in the box that required a VAR review. .Hungry for more, Fernandes almost scored a hat-trick deep into stoppage time, with his effort saved at the near post by Rochet and a strike in the dying moments that cannoned off the post. .Portugal are now the third team to reach the last 16 after France and Brazil. .Uruguay has one point from two matches and needs to beat Ghana on Friday to stand a chance of advancing. Even a draw against South Korea in their final Group H match on Friday will secure first place for Portugal. For Uruguay, it will be a must-win game against Ghana. .“We’ll need to gamble more. We need to be a bold team,” the Uruguay coach, Diego Alonso, said after the match on Monday. .Ghana survived a furious late siege of their goal to revive their World Cup chances in a dramatic match on Monday against South Korea, where the African side secured a 3-2 victory that was greeted with as much relief as celebration. .Ghana’s Mohammed Salisu scored the opener in a roller-coaster match at the Education City Stadium, and teammate Mohammed Kudus headed home another as Ghana took a 2-0 halftime lead, only for South Korea to come fighting back with two goals in three minutes from Cho Gue-sung. .Cho’s goals were both powerful headers as the Ghanaian defence was overrun, first in the 58th minute and, with the Korean supporters behind the Ghana goal already in delirium, a second following just three minutes later. .South Korea then made changes at halftime that put them right back in the match, even if talisman Son Heung-min, again playing with a black face mask to protect his facial fractures, proved surprisingly ineffectual. .Beginning the second half, the South Koreans fought back in spectacular style, but one second-half error ultimately proved costly when Ghana snatched back the lead as Kudus delivered the winning goal. .A goal ahead, Ghana then sat back and were besieged for about half an hour, with Lawrence Ati-Zigi making several good saves and his defenders putting their bodies on the line as they blocked efforts from all angles from the South Koreans. .Ten minutes of stoppage time added to the game only served to heighten the drama, culminating in a contrast of emotions at the final whistle as an exhausted Ghana celebrated and the Koreans were left in tears. .Son Heung-min was visibly upset at the final whistle and with South Korea’s World Cup hopes hanging by a thread. .South Korea’s manager Paulo Bento was red-carded as his frustrations boiled over at the final whistle in a verbal tirade at English referee Anthony Taylor. .Bento was furious South Korea were denied a corner when Taylor ended the game after the allocated 10 minutes of stoppage time. .“The result is totally unfair, even a draw would be unfair. We deserved a win,” South Korea’s assistant coach, Sergio Costa, said after the match. .The African side have earned their first points of the tournament and can still possibly reach the second round of the tournament. .Ghana coach Otto Addo said after the match that the Black Stars would seal their entry into the group of 16 by beating Uruguay when they meet on Friday in their final group H match. .  .The Portugal vs Uruguay match was briefly interrupted on Monday by a protester carrying a rainbow flag and wearing a blue Superman T-shirt that said “SAVE UKRAINE” on the front and “RESPECT FOR IRANIAN WOMAN” on the back. .Security officials chased the protester down and the flag was dropped on the field.",327

331,Published On 28 Nov 2022,Ongoing protests cast shadow over World Cup for Iranian Americans,Protests against the Iranian government following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini have spilled over into football.,".Los Angeles, California, United States — For years, cheering on the Iranian national football team was a way for some Iranian Americans to celebrate their home country without endorsing the clerical government that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution. .But this year, as Iran competes in the 2022 World Cup, politics are on the pitch, as players and fans echo the protests sweeping Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being detained by the country’s morality police in September. .In Los Angeles, home to one of the world’s largest Persian diaspora communities, feelings towards Iran’s participation in the World Cup are mixed, with some spectators voicing disillusionment with the Iranian national team, also known as Team Melli. .“It’s safe to say that everything has been politicised,” said Benjamin Radd, an expert on Iranian politics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). “Sports has entered the fray, and you’re seeing acts of protest from prominent athletes, and these are forums for worldwide attention.” .In the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Westwood, an area with a large Iranian American community, Farsi is frequently spoken, and posters bearing the image of Amini or popular slogans from the protest movement such as “Women, Life, Freedom” abound. .But among residents, enthusiasm for the upcoming game against the United States is difficult to find. .“During the last World Cup, our restaurant was full of people celebrating,” said Ranna, who moved to the US from Tehran in 2005 and works at a Persian restaurant in Westwood. She asked that only her first name be used due to the sensitive nature of the protests. .“But this year it’s different. The government is killing people in the street. What is there to celebrate?” .In Iran, the government’s reaction to the protests following Amini’s death has been harsh. According to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group monitoring the unrest, more than 400 people have been killed and nearly 18,000 people have been arrested as the government tries to break the most formidable challenge to its system of clerical rule in years. .Last week, the United Nations voted to investigate potential human rights abuses by the government, with a focus on violence against women and children. .Some Iranian celebrities and athletes have voiced support for the protesters. And at the World Cup, Iranian fans have also used the tournament as a forum to draw attention to the demonstrations and the government’s response. .During their team’s opening match against England, Iranian fans chanted slogans like “Say her name! Mahsa Amini!” and “Zan, Zindagi, Azadi”, which translates to “Women, Life, Freedom”. .The Iranian national team itself stayed silent in an act of protest as Iran’s national anthem played, although they declined to do so in their next match against Wales. .Before the start of the tournament, the team’s captain Ehsan Hajsafi said in a press conference that he wished to express “condolences to all the grieving families in Iran. They should know that we stand with them and we sympathise with them.” .He added, “We are here, but it does not mean that we should be silent.” .Radd, the UCLA professor, pointed out that Iranian celebrities and athletes are under immense pressure from the government, which sees even mild statements of support for the protests as a threat. .“The government has learned that any act of protest can be a spark,” Radd told Al Jazeera. “And they will be imposing a cost that makes even token acts of defiance an act of incredible bravery.” .One athlete — Voria Ghafouri, a Kurdish Iranian footballer and former member of the national team — was recently arrested for spreading “propaganda”, following his outspoken support for the protesters. He also expressed solidarity with Iran’s Kurdish communities, where there have been reports of especially severe crackdowns by the government. Iran state media said Ghafouri has since been released on bail. .Radd said that he has heard members of the Iranian diaspora in Los Angeles express sympathy for the pressure that Iran’s players are under. But they would like to see more acts of solidarity from other teams, who do not face the same penalties for speaking out. .“The regime wants to avoid acts of international spectacle,” Radd said. “But as we’re seeing in protests all around the world, repression takes a lot of work. There are too many ways to get the message out.” .But back in Westwood, some spectators are unimpressed. Rafi Khazai, a shopper who spoke outside a grocery store in Westwood while visiting from Paris, expressed disappointment that the Iranian national team had met with Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi ahead of the World Cup. .Khazai would have liked to see the team drop out of the tournament altogether. .“In solidarity with the protests, all 11 players should have refused to play,” he said. “If they would have stood down, it would have been in the history books. They would have been heroes.” .Pedram Dolatabadi, another shopper who travels nearly an hour from his California residence to buy groceries in the Persian neighbourhood, voiced sympathy for the Iranian players, saying they face serious risks by speaking out. .“I am certain that they have been forced and threatened to show pro-regime gestures such as singing the national anthem,” Dolatabadi told Al Jazeera. “So deep inside I do not see them as Islamic republic sympathisers.” .Dolatabadi added, “I look forward to seeing the entire team rising against the regime and standing in solidarity with their people.” .Arash Sobhani, an Iranian activist and musician based in New York City, believes spectators are more disillusioned with the Iranian national team than ever before. .“For a while, the national team was the darling of everyone because they were one of the only avenues to cheer for Iran regardless of your political background,” Sobhani said. “This time around it’s different. Gradually, people have started to feel that this team doesn’t represent the people of Iran.” .Sobhani pointed out that politics have long been present in Iranian football. Iranian women, for instance, have been largely banned from football stadiums since 1979. This year’s World Cup has only brought those issues into sharper focus, he said. .“Even if the national team makes it to the final, it won’t unite the nation,” said Sobhani. Some, he noted, will even be cheering for the United States on Tuesday.",331
332,Published On 28 Nov 2022,Fans unimpressed amid flag row ahead of Iran-US World Cup clash,US Soccer social media post that depicted a modified Iranian flag triggered a furore ahead of a critical Group B match.,".Doha, Qatar – Iranian and American football fans in Doha have criticised a US Soccer social media post that depicted a modified Iranian flag and triggered a furore ahead of a crucial World Cup match between the two sides. .The row erupted on Saturday after the US Soccer Federation posted a graphic of the Iran flag without the word “Allah” written on it on its social media feeds. .The Iranian Football Federation condemned the move and lodged a protest with the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), demanding sanctions against the United States team. .By Sunday afternoon, the standard flag with the emblem had been restored on US Soccer’s Twitter banner, and the Facebook and Instagram posts with the altered flag had been removed. .US Soccer said the post was a show of solidarity with the “women in Iran fighting for basic human rights” in the wake of the death of 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in police custody. .“We wanted to show our support for the women in Iran with our graphic for 24 hours,” the federation said. .On Monday, the US team coach Gregg Berhalter apologised over the furore and said his staff were not made aware of the posts. .“All we can do is apologise on behalf of the players and the staff, but it’s not something that we were a part of,” he said. .Fans in Doha, however, said they thought the original posts were in poor taste and added unnecessary heat to an already politically charged atmosphere around the game. Iran and the US are geopolitical foes and have not had diplomatic relations for more than four decades. .Gholam, an Iranian fan in Doha who will attend Tuesday’s match, slammed the move and accused the US of trying to “stoke a fire” before the match. .“They [the US] are out to use every opportunity to mislead people about Iran. It is hypocrisy. .“Before they criticise others, they should look at what happens in their own country. They have mass shootings every other day, they ignore the problem of racism but these are very serious issues.” .Vicky, a US national living in Qatar, said the World Cup has brought people together and raised concerns that the US Soccer posts were ill-judged and could stoke divisions. .“The spirit of such a tournament should be of inclusion and grace, and politics should be kept out of the game,” she told Al Jazeera on Monday. .“There are so many countries trying to take a stand on certain issues and not always doing it in the right way. For the US to mess with a country’s flag is not graceful.” .The two nations have faced each other on three previous occasions. Iran won the most recent encounter 2-1 during the 1998 World Cup in France. .Gholam said he expected the US would face the same result in Tuesday’s march, where a place in the last 16 of the tournament is at stake. .“Americans used the same tactics before the game in 1998, and look at what happened? We won. We’re going to do the same tomorrow.”",332
333,Published On 28 Nov 2022,Brazil edge gritty Switzerland to gain round of 16 World Cup spot,"Resolute Switzerland keep Brazil at bay for most of the match, but Casemiro’s audacious strike breaks the deadlock.",".A superb finish by Casemiro is enough to give Brazil victory over Switzerland and guarantee a place in the knock-out stages of the football World Cup in Qatar. .Brazil’s coach, Tite, had named nine forwards to his squad, but it took a defensive midfielder to break the scoreless deadlock in the 83rd minute of Monday’s match. Casemiro made an audacious strike from the outside of his boot, which took a tiny deflection off defender Manuel Akanji’s backside. .The result at Stadium 974 means Brazil, five-time world champions, qualify comfortably for the round of 16 with a game against Cameroon still to play in the group stage of the tournament. .Switzerland sit second in Group G after a thrilling six-goal draw between Serbia and Cameroon earlier in the day left both teams with a point each. .Brazil forward Neymar stayed at the team’s hotel, treating a right ankle injury sustained in the opener against Serbia. Team doctors have not yet given a timetable for his return – or said if he will return at all. In his absence, former Watford striker Richarlison took centre stage in Brazil’s attack but couldn’t find a way to score and was substituted for Gabriel Jesus in the 74th minute. .Switzerland managed not a single shot on target but were able to keep Brazil at bay for the majority of the match. The scoreless first half was a fairly even-handed affair. .Vinicius Jr thought he had given Brazil the lead with a shot from inside the area after a pass by Casemiro in the 64th minute, but a video review spotted Richarlison offside in the build-up to the strike. .After Casemiro’s lightning 83rd minute goal, Brazil looked likely to score a second – despite a brief flurried counterattack from the Swiss – as Vinicius Jr tried to take on Akanji when he could have passed. Moments later, he instead fed a ball to Rodrygo, only to see the forward’s shot blocked out for a corner. .Brazil, who have not lost a World Cup group stage game in 17 matches, are the second team to qualify for the round of 16 after defending world champions France.",333

You see we live to fight another day. So we don’t mind the draw,” Ndjiago told Al Jazeera. .During the match, he enthusiastically shouted, “Cameroon! Cameroon! Cameroon!” prompting other fans to break into song. .Three goals from Serbia followed Cameroon’s opening goal by Jean-Charles Castelletto. However, the introduction of Castelletto’s compatriot Aboubakar helped change the course of the game to secure the draw. As Cameroon scored two goals in the second half, its supporters leapt to their feet, hugging, dancing and chanting. .On Friday, Cameroon will face Brazil. .“It’s a tough next one, but we will be there. We will bring our fighting spirit. And see, no matter the results, football makes us forget all our troubles,” Ndjiago said with a wink.",335
336,Published On 28 Nov 2022,Ghana triumph as South Korea almost stage comeback,Ghana overcome a second-half comeback from South Korea in the second goal-heavy thriller of the day.,".Ghana have been able to overcome a spirited South Korean comeback, defeating them 3-2 in what has been the most exciting day of the 2022 World cup so far. .Earlier on Monday, Cameroon and Serbia shared points in an exhilarating 3-3 draw. .Mohammed Salisu and Mohammed Kudus gave Ghana a two-nil first-half lead on Monday at Education City Stadium as they brushed aside some early pressure from South Korea. .The first goal was bundled in by Salisu in the 24th minute after South Korea failed to clear a cross into the box. The second was a delicate glancing header from the 22-year-old Kudus, who has been on fine form for his club, Ajax, this season. .South Korea fought back in the second half with two almost identical headers from Cho Guesung as they threatened to cause another incredible World Cup comeback. .Early second-half changes breathed new life into South Korea’s attack, and Lee Kangin had barely been on the field for a minute when he helped dispossess Tariq Lamptey and fired in a cross that Cho attacked with pace, leaving Salisu watching as he got in front of his marker to power home a 58th-minute header. .The 24-year-old centre-forward popped up three minutes later when a chip from Kim Jinsu caught the out-of-position goalkeeper Lawrence Ati Zigi scrambling, and Cho climbed above the centre-backs to score a dramatic equaliser. .However, Ghana could rely on Kudus again. The midfielder converted a cross from Gideon Mensah with a clinical sidefooted finish in the 68th minute. .South Korea applied some heavy pressure in the final minutes, peppering the Ghanaian goal with dangerous crosses, but they could not find a way through. .Ghana, who would have been eliminated with a defeat, finish the group stage against Uruguay on Friday, with last-16 qualification on the line as South Korea – on one point – play Portugal. .Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal take on the Uruguayans in the other group game later today.",336
337,Published On 28 Nov 2022,The massive hypocrisy of the West’s World Cup ‘concerns’,"As the old saying goes, look in the mirror before you judge others.",".United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently came out against a ban on rainbow armbands at the World Cup tournament in Qatar, which various European team captains had intended to sport in support of LGBTQ rights and against discrimination. Blinken flagged the ban as “concerning” and a restriction on “freedom of expression”. .The secretary’s scolding came on the heels of another rather “concerning” development on the world stage: a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in the US state of Colorado that killed five people and wounded 18 others. This, in a country that fancies itself the global role model in terms of respect for freedom of expression, human rights, and all that good stuff – and yet where it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to exercise their right to not be massacred at nightclubs, elementary schools, places of worship, shopping malls, and so on. .In 2016, the US witnessed its worst mass shooting in history when 50 people were killed in an attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. .This year, an independent UN human rights expert found that LGBTQ rights in the US are “under a concerted attack” and being “deliberately undermined” by state governments. Add to this landscape the institutionalised racism and discrimination that constitutes “freedom” in the US, and it seems US officials might have slightly more pressing matters to attend to on the home front than World Cup armbands. .Indeed, as this year’s World Cup host, Qatar has come under intense US and European fire on the issue of gay rights as well as migrant worker exploitation (not to mention the violation of the apparent human right to drink beer in sports stadiums). After all, Orientalism dies hard – and what better backdrop for the release of pent-up Western chauvinism than a football tournament in a bona fide Middle Eastern desert, enduring Orientalist symbol of Arab backwardness and resistance to progress? .The point of calling out Western criticisms is not to contend, crassly, that the Gulf emirate is categorically beyond reproach. It is, rather, to highlight the massive hypocrisy that is on display when countries that continue to commit more human rights abuses than Qatar could ever dream of decide to unilaterally award themselves the moral high ground. .It’s kind of like when the US rails against oppressive government behaviour in Cuba. The critiques are not necessarily invalid in and of themselves, but they command zero moral traction given the US’s superior track record of oppression, including its barbarous 60-year embargo of the island and its operation of an illegal prison and torture centre on occupied Cuban territory in Guantánamo Bay. .As the old saying goes, look in the mirror before you judge others. .Navid Zarrinnal, a scholar of Iran and the Middle East at Stanford University in California, remarked in an email to me that “Western supremacist attitudes and cultural imperialism” are being showcased at the World Cup – “disguised”, as usual, as “advocacy for human rights”. This arrangement naturally makes it difficult for Western states and NGOs to “prioritise self-reflection over their saviour anxieties”. .The people who are “parachuting into Qatar to lecture them about gay rights”, Zarrinnal said, are ignorant of the long history of homosexuality in the Arab world, which is “reflected in their poetry, visual art, and social history”. He continued on to describe how Western powers, now with their footballers at the vanguard, have instead reduced the panorama to a simplistic narrative of repression – salvation from which depends entirely on whether Arab homosexuality can be “molded into the same LGBTQ identities they have in their own countries”. .On the eve of the World Cup kickoff, Gianni Infantino, the Italian president of FIFA, delivered a rambling speech, which – a couple of patronising detours into Orientalism notwithstanding – took some valid hits at Western hypocrisy: “I think for what we Europeans have been doing in the last 3,000 years, around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people”. .He also slammed the selective denunciation of migrant worker abuse in Qatar when Western firms had long been content to profit from labour conditions in the country – which he contended had improved considerably in the context of the World Cup – and when Europe’s own lethally xenophobic anti-migration policy is to blame for thousands upon thousands of refugee deaths in the Mediterranean Sea and beyond. (Of course, European racism and xenophobia can be selectively curtailed in the interest of football; there weren’t many Brits complaining when 21-year-old Nigerian British footballer Bukayo Saka scored two of the goals in England’s first World Cup match this year.) .As for what the US has been doing around the world for much less than 3,000 years, this includes killing Native Americans, enslaving Black people, and serving as the architect of a global capitalist system predicated on vast inequality, the mass trampling of rights, and the subjugation of workers. .Even as the US violates everyone else’s borders to sow military and economic havoc, it furiously fortifies its own – a practice that, as in Europe, has rendered US-bound migration a frequently deadly undertaking. Not that life is a peach for those who successfully cross the border, many of whom perform services crucial to the US economy and yet are drastically underpaid, demonised by society, and utilised as political scapegoats. .In other words, it’s all pretty “concerning”, to borrow Blinken’s term. Just as it’s concerning that a country that has bombed countless human beings to bits feels qualified to sermonise on any matter relating to human rights. .Writing recently at the Guardian, David Wearing – a University of Sussex lecturer and the author of AngloArabia: Why Gulf Wealth Matters to Britain – observes that much of the discourse surrounding the current World Cup is driven by “racist caricatures” pitting an enlightened West against an irreparably uncivilised Middle East. This “self-serving mythology”, Wearing notes, obscures regional history and legitimises Western interference (civilised bombing, anyone?) – it also “externalises and circumscribes the blame for human rights abuses… while preserving a narcissistic sense of western innocence”. .Wearing concludes that the 2022 World Cup, far from being a phenomenon “alien” to the West, is in fact a “representative example of the world that western power built”. And as concerned parties remain up in arms over the perceived contravention of Western values at the tournament, it’s high time to bust out that proverbial mirror. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",337
338,Published On 28 Nov 2022,The World Cup and protests collide in Iran,Protests abound inside Iran as the national team plays at the World Cup.,". .The last time Iran faced the United States at the World Cup, back in 1998, the streets of Tehran erupted in celebration after Iran won. This time around, feelings are much more complicated. Iranians are entering a third month of protests after 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini died in police custody in September. Since then, foreign-based rights groups say hundreds have been killed by security forces and thousands arrested. In this episode, we look at the role athletes are playing in Iran’s protests. .In this episode:  .Connect with us: .@AJEPodcasts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook .Full episode transcript: .This transcript was created using AI. It’s been reviewed by humans, but it might contain errors. Please let us know if you have any corrections or questions, our email is TheTake@aljazeera.net.  .[SOUND OF CELEBRATION] .Halla Mohieddeen: This is what the streets of Tehran sounded like back in the summer of 1998, after Iran beat the United States in a World Cup match many Iranians remember to this day. .Halla Mohieddeen: The two countries are about to face off again, but this time, the environment in Iran couldn’t be more different. .[SOUNDS FROM IRAN PROTESTS] .Newsreel: Let’s turn to Iran now, where anti-government protests continue across the country.  .Newsreel: Their anger was sparked by the death of this woman, Mahsa Amini. She was just 22. .Newsreel: Security forces are cracking down on protests now in their third month. .Halla Mohieddeen: Today, a look at how sport and protest have collided in Iran. I’m Halla Mohieddeen and this is The Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: I’m talking to someone who’s following both Iran’s sports and its ongoing protest movement very closely. .Reza Akbari: My name is Reza Akbari. I am an Iranian American. I was born and raised in Iran and when I was 16, I moved to the United States. .Halla Mohieddeen: Reza’s a PhD student in Washington, DC, where he also works for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting. .Reza Akbari: I spend most of my time observing Iran and learning about the social political dynamics in the country. .Halla Mohieddeen: And you’re a football fan as well? .Reza Akbari: Yes, yes. I’m a huge football fan and I’ve been since I was a teenager. I think one of my first memories was actually the 1998 World Cup. I was around 14, and just old enough for my mom to let me actually go out in the streets and take in some of the celebrations that happened after Iran beat the United States. .Halla Mohieddeen: Fast forward, you know, goodness knows how many years. Iran has qualified for the World Cup again, and the country does seem to be at quite a pivotal moment, albeit a very different one. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Iran has had sustained protests since mid-September Mahsa Jina Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman died in police custody. Have you seen images like this out of Iran in your lifetime? .Reza Akbari: Protests are not necessarily unprecedented in Iran. It has a long history of public discontent and revolutions. This time around, I think what is somewhat surprising is the level of resilience of the protestors. We are into the third month and despite suppression and protestors being targeted, attacked, and killed by a lot of security forces, they continue to show up in the street. .Halla Mohieddeen: Well, against the backdrop of these protests, there has been a lot of controversy around whether a team representing Iran should be at the World Cup or not. Can you break down what the arguments on either side look like? .Reza Akbari: Yes certainly. Many individuals in Iran are wondering if this team is supporting the people, supporting the protestors, or is it supporting the regime? Many outspoken critics believe that the players have not really used their platform to express their support for what’s happening on the streets. The flip side of this argument is that the team should be treated as something much bigger than whatever the ruling apparatus in the country is, or whoever they may be. .Halla Mohieddeen: Take for example the 1978 World Cup, just months before a revolution would oust the reigning monarch, Reza Pahlavi. It was Iran’s first time making the tournament. And Iranians still celebrate that team, despite the contentious political situation. .Halla Mohieddeen:  But there’s one moment that a lot of the team’s critics have pointed to. Before they flew off to Qatar, the players went to meet with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. .Reza Akbari: That caused a lot of anger, among individuals arguing that the regime is killing the protesters. They’re using excessive violence. And in the middle of this, you meet with the president of the country and, as the Iranian tradition goes, you actually stand up and slightly bow forward when your name is called, which many interpreted as, as kowtowing essentially to an authoritarian leader. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Reza says a lot of these critics still understand the pressure the team was under. .Reza Akbari: When you get an official invitation from the office of the president, it’s very difficult for you not to show up. .Halla Mohieddeen: Can’t really say no. .Reza Akbari: Yes. But at the same time, I think they believe that that venue should have at least been used as a way to express discontent. Do you really need to stand up and bow? .Halla Mohieddeen: But some players have been more explicit. That includes Sardar Azmoun, Iran’s famous striker, who posted his support on Instagram just days after protests began. .Reza Akbari: What he said was that the ultimate punishment for him could be to be kicked out of the national team, but that’s a small price to pay for even a single strand of Iranian women’s hair. .Halla Mohieddeen: Other players have used social media to share their discontent too, changing their profile pictures to black squares, or commemorating protesters who have been killed. .Reza Akbari: I think one of the most striking examples of actually using the World Cup was Ehsan Hajsafi. .Halla Mohieddeen: Hajsafi is the captain of Iran’s team. And he made a comment during a press conference on the eve of their match with England. .Reza Akbari: He started his statement with… .Ehsan Hajsafi: Be nom-e khoda-ye rangeen kaman.  .Reza Akbari: In the name of the God of the rainbow. .Halla Mohieddeen: He was referencing Kian Pirfalak, a nine-year-old boy killed in the Iranian city of Izeh earlier this month. Almost immediately after his death, a video he recorded for a science fair went viral on Persian language social media. .[VIDEO PLAYING] .Reza Akbari: He was demonstrating a science project and he had built a boat out of popsicle sticks or something like that. And he was trying to test out the boat in a tub of water and before he started he said in the name of the God of the Rainbow. .[VIDEO PLAYING] .Reza Akbari: He has become a symbol for a lot of innocent protestors that are being killed. .Halla Mohieddeen: Later in the press conference, Hajsafi directly addressed the protests back home. .Ehsan Hajsafi (translated): We have to accept that the situation in our country is not good and that our people are not happy, they are discontent. We are here but it does not mean we should not be their voice or that we should not respect them. .Halla Mohieddeen: We’re talking on Monday, November 21, and Iran has just wrapped up its match against England. And yes, there were a few goals, we could talk about the sport, but one of the moments that really made an impression, for me at least, happened before a ball was kicked. And that was how the Iranian players reacted when their national anthem was played. Can you just describe what happened? .Reza Akbari: Every single Iranian player simply refused to sing along with the national anthem, in order to show their support with the protestors and their dissatisfaction with what the regime has done thus far. .Halla Mohieddeen: What was your reaction when you saw that? Because my reaction was that’s an enormously brave thing to do. .Reza Akbari: I certainly read it the same way. And to be honest, I teared up a little bit because I also was putting myself in the player’s shoes. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Reza Akbari: They are under tremendous amount of pressure. Politics aside, I think for any team, any player, just to be able to get to that stage, and on top of all of that, you’re being put under pressure to show some kind of a political gesture, I think shows a tremendous amount of bravery to do something that I think would be very difficult for a lot of us. .Halla Mohieddeen: Do you think they face any kind of repercussions when they eventually return to Iran? .Reza Akbari: I think it’s very possible. There are conservative individuals in the country, parliamentary members, conservative pundits who have already expressed how disgraceful it is for you not to sing along to the national anthem. But the reality of the matter is that we just certainly have to wait and see. .Halla Mohieddeen: How has that been received by Iranians, seeing their team staying silent during the national anthem? .Reza Akbari: There’s a certain segment of the population that will never be satisfied. I think you essentially are done with the regime. You’re done with the team. It doesn’t matter what they do, no gesture is going to be able to make up for the atrocities that have taken place during the past couple of months. The segment of the population that was viewing the team as a national team, rather than a team that belongs to the government, is very content. It was powerful, and the players used the stage that they were given very properly. You also have a segment of the population that was more or less on the fence. They love the game, they love the team, and, some of those individuals, have taken the gesture in a positive manner and of course, they’re hoping for more. .Halla Mohieddeen: Reza told me this on Monday. By Friday, when Iran went up against Wales, things already looked different. This time, the team mouthed along to the anthem, amid jeers and booing from the stands. The day before, the government arrested popular Iranian Kurdish football player Voria Ghafouri, who had played internationally for Iran in the past. Ghafouri has been a vocal supporter of the protests. He’s accused of having tarnished the reputation of the national team and spreading propaganda against Iran. .Halla Mohieddeen: It is quite subtle, these forms of protest and just to move on from football, cause it’s not just the footballers, can you just talk us through some of the other instances of protest from other athletes in other sports? .Reza Akbari: Elnaz Rekabi is probably one of the most prominent examples of this. .Halla Mohieddeen: She’s an Iranian rock climber. And in October, she competed in an Asian championship, noticeably without a headscarf. .Newsreel: There are growing concerns about Iranian climber Elnaz Rekabi who competed without a hijab at a competition in South Korea in defiance of Iran’s strict rules.  .Reza Akbari: She, of course, later on said that, oh, given the intensity of the moment I actually forgot and went on without my scarf. But I think as far as the population is concerned, the majority of people believe that this was a sign of protest. .[AIRPORT CELEBRATIONS] .Halla Mohieddeen: Iranians showed up at the airport at the crack of dawn as Rekabi returned from her competition to give her a hero’s welcome. And since her protest, other women athletes have competed abroad without wearing a headscarf. .Reza Akbari: And when it comes to not singing the national anthem, Iran’s national soccer team was not the first team to do so. .[IRAN NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Iran’s basketball team, volleyball team, water polo team, and beach football team did the same. .Reza Akbari: They all refused to sing the national anthem when the song was being played. .Halla Mohieddeen: There’s another moment that’s received a lot of attention, this one from Saeed Piramoon, a beach football player. .Reza Akbari: He scored a very impressive goal. .[PIRAMOON GOAL AND CHEERING] .Reza Akbari: And, instead of celebrating, what he did is pretended to essentially put his hair in a bun and use his fingers as scissors to cut that. And that’s in solidarity symbolising what countless women have done in Iran as a sign of protest. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: When they do these gestures, where do you think they’re aimed? Are these gestures directed towards the people in Iran or just to show this on a wider international stage? .Reza Akbari: Well I think it depends on the stage. When you’re dealing with the World Cup, your audience by audience by nature is global. But when you are playing for a small futsal club inside the country, that gesture, primarily,  I believe, is meant for the local audience and the local protestors. .Halla Mohieddeen: Take, for example, when the local Tehran football club Esteghlal won the country’s super cup earlier this month. The players didn’t celebrate. .Reza Akbari: It was actually an eerie scene to watch. You have a soccer club who has won the championship. The cup is being held up, but all players are standing like statues and are not moving, and no one is cheering. They’re essentially showing their discontent to the security forces and the brutal suppressive policies that the government has implemented thus far. .Halla Mohieddeen: After the break, a look back at 1998, and the most political match in World Cup history. .Halla Mohieddeen: We mentioned this earlier, Reza, but you were in Iran the last time that they played the US in the World Cup, and that was back in 1998. Can you just tell me about the match? What exactly do you remember? .Reza Akbari: Oh my god. That was certainly a different time. You had a country that was experiencing the reform movement. There was a lot of joy already embedded within the society. One of the most controversial matches actually of that period was the game between Iran and the United States, and the Iranian team actually managed to win that game 2-1. Estili’s header is something that many soccer fans will remember. I remember that as well. I was sitting in the living room with my parents and my very young brother at the time, and the entire neighbourhood exploded. .Halla Mohieddeen: And like Reza mentioned earlier, there were massive street celebrations after the match. .[1998 CELEBRATIONS IN THE STREET] .Reza Akbari: I vividly remember a gentleman celebrating on the back of a truck. He fell off and essentially the crowd surfed. He never hit the ground and the crowd surfed back up to the truck and his joy never disappeared. He was jubilant throughout the entire ordeal. Those scenes were certainly rare back then where you would see public dancing and people essentially using their car radios or using boom boxes to blast music, and girls and boys dancing together and the crowds cheering. I think it’s closest to pure joy that I’ve experienced in a long time. So it’s certainly a memorable time. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: You did mention, Reza, that the reform movement was in full swing at that time. Can you just remind us what the political circumstances were like back then within Iran? .Reza Akbari: In 1997, you had Mohammed Khatami, who unexpectedly won the presidency of the country. He was a reform-minded cleric and his contender Nategh-Nouri was being backed by the supreme leader, the loss for him was devastating and the victory for Khatami incredible and joyous. The population unequivocally demonstrated that they want change. .Halla Mohieddeen: News reports from the time echo Reza’s nostalgia. .Newsreel: I feel so good. Are you happy he won the election? Very much. Very much. .Reza Akbari: Civil society was bustling and many individuals in the country were hopeful for what Iran could be in the future. Amid all of that, you also have the Iranian team qualify for the World Cup. .Halla Mohieddeen: It was the first time Iran had qualified in 20 years. And the team was beloved by the country. .Reza Akbari: To this day, they’re being referred to as the golden generation of the Iranian soccer. So to kind of have those players, in that moment in history, after decades of not qualifying for the World Cup, it seemed like everything was possible. And the joy of that moment is something I think that many remember and cherish. .Halla Mohieddeen: How have the members of that golden generation of Iranian football reacted to these protests? .Reza Akbari: They have been very vocal. .Halla Mohieddeen: That includes one of the legends of the sport. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Reza Akbari: Ali Daei is one of the most prominent football players in Iran. Actually until very recently, he was the record holder for the most international goals scored in the world. Cristiano Ronaldo actually broke his record. Many Iranians believe that Daei is one of the best that the country has ever offered, not just in the field, but his performance off the field as well. He’s very educated and consistent in his approach when it comes to supporting the public. .Halla Mohieddeen: Daei has spoken out many times about the protests, most notably after the death of a schoolgirl in his hometown of Ardabil. Ahead of the World Cup, he made another gesture. On Instagram, he announced that despite an official invitation, he would not be attending the tournament in solidarity with protesters. There’s another player, just shy of that generation, who’s become a populist hero. Ali Karimi got his start for the international team in 1998, months after Iran’s win against the US. .Reza Akbari: His nickname is the magician because of the fact that he was just so talented on the field and his movements were so incredibly hard to predict. .Halla Mohieddeen: Karimi has been vocally in support of demonstrators. Just before Iran played England, he was tweeting, letting people know about a shortage of blood in Javanrud, where rights groups say there was a crackdown against protesters. People in Doha celebrated Karimi, chanting his name both outside the stadium and inside, during the match. .Reza Akbari: The chants are essentially trying to commemorate what he has done. They could also be perceived perhaps as a way to show other players to see his example and duplicate what he has done. .Halla Mohieddeen: If 1998 felt like a moment of opportunity, how do you think Iranians will look back at this tournament? What do you think they’ll remember? .Reza Akbari: I’m not sure if that many pleasant memories will stick with us. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Reza Akbari: We are dealing with a moment in time where even the fact that the national team may not belong to the people is a question. Also given the tragedies that are happening on the streets in Iran, it’s very difficult to put that in the background and cheer. The context that these games are currently happening in for the Iranians, I think will leave us with memories of frustration and anger from this period, which is a very contrasting kind of feeling when you talk about the 1998 versus what’s happening in Iran today. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s The Take.

339,Published On 28 Nov 2022,The beauty shop catering to Qatar’s African community,"Inside a bustling Doha neighbourhood is a popular beauty and fashion store, which was started by a former taxi driver.",".Doha, Qatar – In the heart of the lively Doha neighbourhood of Al Mansoura is a beauty and fashion shop which has gained a strong following among Africans living in the Qatari capital ever since the store opened about two years ago. .Butterfly Beauty Shop is located along Al Mansoura’s crowded main street and is nestled among grocery stores – known locally by the Arabic word baqaala, restaurants, tea and snack spots and a smattering of hardware supply shops. .The shelves and aisles of Butterfly Beauty Shop are packed with beauty products, hair extensions, fashion accessories, clothes, shoes, and seemingly every possible fashion item from Africa. .“This is the only shop catering to the fashion needs of Africans in Qatar,” boasts the Kenyan shop owner Bernard Wanjiku, 32. .Qatar is home to a diverse foreign community that makes up 90 percent of the country’s population. .The sub-Saharan African community accounts for roughly 6 percent of the total population in Qatar, with foreign nationals coming from countries such as Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, South Africa, Somalia and Ghana. .Wanjiku arrived in Doha from Kenya in 2013 to work as a driver for a local organisation, but switched jobs to become a taxi driver five years later. It was through conversations with his clients that he got the idea to start his own business. .“Every time someone from Africa sat in my cab, they would ask me if I knew of someone coming from home who could bring some beauty products,” he tells Al Jazeera. .“It would happen so frequently that I realised this was a business opportunity waiting to be grabbed.” .Wanjiku’s operations started small. In the beginning, he would arrange for friends travelling from Kenya to bring skincare and hair products in small batches, and then he would sell them to Africans who he met on taxi rides. Those customers would keep coming back for his products. .“I wanted to test the waters before investing all my savings in one place. For four years, I ran this business as a side hustle on [a] demand-and-supply basis while having a cab as my main source of income,” explains Wanjiku, whose beauty business spread by word of mouth. .Since opening the shop in February 2021, Wanjiku has already established a significant clientele, most of whom have followed his journey from the taxi to his brick-and-mortar store in a bustling neighbourhood. .But Wanjiku admits he has social media to thank for the rapid growth of his business. .“Soon after the opening, African people living in Mansoura posted photos and videos from inside the shop,” he explains. “They would try on some wigs, hair extensions or rave about finally having access to skin products from back home.” .Some of these posts led to social media buzz among Qatar’s African community. .“A group of Sudanese shoppers once posted something from here, and it went viral within their community, leading to queues and traffic jams outside my shop in the following days,” he recalls, laughing. .At the time, the shop had recently opened and the Sudanese shoppers had posted pictures of themselves on social media trying on hair extensions and clothes. Wanjiku himself uses WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram to promote his business. .Jessie, one of the shop assistants, shows some face creams and hair products to a couple from Kenya. He tells them which product would work better for them, and assures them of its authenticity. .“Jessie is from Kenya as well,” Wanjiku says. “It is important to have people who understand the products and connect with the shoppers to make them feel like they are back home.” .Mehrab, who is from Uganda, is browsing in the shop. He says he first visited the store a few months ago after some of his Kenyan friends shared a YouTube video about it. .He says he often stops by to chat about news from “back home” and to see if there are any new products to try. .“Not all hair products work on African hair,” he says, running his hand over his head. “I have lost so much hair since moving to Qatar but now that I know about this place, I come here to get hair products from home.” .Colourful printed shirts called dashikis hang from a rail high above the shelves. Jessie says they are among the best-selling items as Filipinos and Arabs like to buy them as well. .He points at a rack of sparkly satin dresses and says Kenyan women love them because they are on trend. .“Kenyan women love following fashion from the rich and influential people back home, so we try to cater to their demands and bring them [fashion trends] here,” Jessie says. .“Sometimes, they just hold up their phones to show us exactly which trendy outfit they want and if we have it, they will put it on and post about it on their social media accounts right away.” .Some Nigerian men and women, visiting Qatar for the World Cup, enter the shop and browse the clothes on display. They want to see if the country has any African fan paraphernalia to offer. .“We are here to support the African teams,” says Steve, one of the tourists. .Wanjiku pulls out a few African flags from a box and unfurls them for the shoppers. .He says he changed the look of his shop front in the weeks leading up to the World Cup to match the occasion. The display is now adorned with large flags and the football shirts of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Ghana and other participating teams. .“Ghana, Senegal and Cameroon flags are very popular. In fact, I have had to restock on Ghanaian flags as they have been selling out quickly.” .An Indian fan of the Argentinian football team beckons Jessie from the door. .“Brother, do you have a Messi shirt? Number 10?” he asks. He walks away disappointed when Jessie shakes his head. .Wanjiku says the South Asians and Filipinos of Al Mansoura are interested in supporting only Argentina, Brazil and Qatar. .Wanjiku has already started planning for life after the World Cup. .“There is a trend of Kenyan, African-style placemats that is picking up back home. I want to bring them here for the local Africans. I know they will ask for them as soon as they see it on social media.” .Jessie nods and chimes in, “You see that yellow T-shirt up there?” He points to a bright T-shirt emblazoned with a photo of George Wajackoyah, a losing candidate in this year’s general elections in Kenya. .“We got it because this man was popular among the youth back home, and the young Kenyan people here wanted to be a part of the trend,” he explains. “Anything that’s popular in Kenya, we bring it to Qatar.”",339
340,Published On 28 Nov 2022,Cameroon stage incredible comeback in 6-goal thriller with Serbia,Exciting end-to-end match for World Cup’s Group G finishes 3-3.,".Cameroon and Serbia have shared the spoils in a six-goal thriller – arguably the most exciting game of the World Cup in Qatar so far. .Jean-Charles Castelletto opened the scoring in the 29th minute for Cameroon after Serbia’s Aleksandr Mitrovic hit the post in the match’s early stages. The FC Nantes centre-back found himself unmarked at the far post following a flick-on from a corner and tapped the ball in, sending the Cameroon fans into raptures. .Two quickfire goals from Strahinja Pavlovic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic just before the break then saw Serbia head into half-time in the lead. .The first was a powering header from Pavlovic, who found himself unmarked, ending an impressive period of defensive dominance from Cameroon in the early stages. The second goal resulted from a neat one-two between Andrija Zivkovic and Milinkovic-Savi, who scored with a low-hard shot from just outside the area. .Mitrovic then added a third in the 53rd minute as Serbia appeared to be in cruise control. It was a magnificent team goal with a string of passes across the box, leaving the striker with a simple tap-in. .It was a topsy-turvy game, with Cameroon then staging a second-half comeback after newly introduced Vincent Aboubakar scored an outrageous lob in the 64th minute after sending a defender the wrong way with a feint. The referee initially ruled it offside until VAR intervened. .Just two minutes later, Aboubakar drove down the right and passed it across the goal to Bayern Munich’s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, who tapped it in. .There were wild celebrations in the stands as Cameroon manager Rigobert Song thumped the air. It was a remarkable comeback that epitomised a thrilling match that provided end-to-end action throughout. .Serbia missed several guilt-edged chances in the final minutes, with Mitrovic hesitating to shoot when one-on-one with Devis Epassy, who was able to make himself big and stop the ball with his face. .A draw is a fair result considering the chances created by both teams, but ultimately, Serbia will be frustrated that they let a two-goal second-half lead slip. .The draw gives both sides one point, with Brazil and Switzerland on three ahead of their meeting later on Monday. Serbia take on the Swiss in their final group game on Friday when Cameroon entertain the Brazilians.",340

Who is out?,A look at which teams have made it to the knockouts of the World Cup 2022 and who is going home.,.The World Cup 2022 is heading towards the business end: the knockouts. .Here is a list of teams that have qualified for the round of 16 and the ones who have been knocked out.,341
342,Published On 28 Nov 2022,"World Cup 2022, Day 9: The schedule and what’s at stake for teams",,".Four games are scheduled for day nine — Monday, November 28 — of the Qatar 2022 World Cup. .Cameroon vs Serbia (Group G): 1pm (10:00 GMT), Al Janoub Stadium .South Korea vs Ghana (Group G): 4pm (13:00 GMT), Education City Stadium .Brazil vs Switzerland (Group H): 7pm (16:00 GMT), Stadium 974 .Portugal vs Uruguay (Group H): 10 pm (19:00 GMT), Lusail Iconic Stadium .It is do-or-die for Cameroon and Serbia. Both teams are facing elimination on Monday afternoon. A losing effort by either team — taking into account a potential draw between Brazil and Switzerland — will spell a premature exit for the two teams. .Serbia, who sit in the basement of Group G, were downed 2-0 by Brazil, while Cameroon were edged 1-0 by Switzerland — both teams are scoreless thus far. .The young and inexperienced Cameroon team is also in search of their first win since the 2002 World Cup. .“The mistakes that were made [against Switzerland] will not be made again in the next game,” coach Rigobert Song said after Cameroon’s loss to the Swiss. .FIFA is currently investigating Serbia’s football association after a nationalist flag — depicting Kosovo as part of the Balkan nation — was photographed in the team’s dressing room when they faced Brazil last week in Qatar. .“No comment, next question,” Serbia’s head coach Dragan Stojkovic said on Sunday when asked about the alleged incident. .Keep an eye on Karl Toko Ekambi, who scored Cameroon’s World Cup-qualifying goal in a tie against Algeria. Ekambi, however, failed to capitalise on one of Cameroon’s better offensive opportunities against a mediocre Switzerland in the game’s opening half. .Cameroon’s Choupo-Moting is another fan favourite looking to make an impact on the scoresheet. .Serbia are reeling from a number of injuries, most notably, 28-year-old talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who broke the record for the most goals scored in an English league season last year. .But it is not all bad news for Serbia: after missing the team’s first game against Brazil due to injury, winger Filip Kostic is available for selection on Monday, although it is not clear if he will start. .“The situation is not excellent, but I am satisfied compare[d] with what we had before. The situation is better and that makes me happy,” Stojkovic told reporters on Sunday. .South Korea and Ghana are desperately looking to take a win after losing points in their first matches in the tightly contested Group H. .On Wednesday, a scrappy South Korea drew 0-0 against Uruguay, while Ghana are coming off a simmering 2-3 loss to Cristiano Ronaldo’s mighty Portugal on the same day. .The threat of possible elimination has not diminished South Korea’s hopes, even though they are neck-and-neck with Uruguay with only one point in their grouping. .“I said earlier I do not feel any pressure, I never did and never will,” South Korea’s coach Paulo Bento told reporters on Sunday. .“During the first game, we had a chance of at least ensuring a third-place finish. In the second game, we will keep this opportunity … we will enter the field with a focus on a win,” he said. .South Korea, ranked 28th, are appearing in their 11th World Cup — the most for any Asian country. .Ghana are ranked 61st and it is their fourth World Cup. .  .  .All eyes will be on South Korea’s captain Son Heung-min. .Battling the aftermath of an eye-socket fracture, he commanded South Korea’s offensive drive in the scoreless match against Uruguay. He was fitted with a facemask for his last game after undergoing surgery earlier this month. . .Football fans will recall Heung-min scored South Korea’s two of the three goals when they advanced from the group stage at Russia’s 2018 World Cup. .It is unclear if South Korea defender Kim Min-jae, who sustained a calf injury against Uruguay, will play on Monday. Forward Hwang Hee-chan is also sidelined due to a hamstring injury. .Ghana, led by their fearless captain, André Ayew and feisty Ajax midfielder Mohammed Kudus, will be hoping to inject some much-needed life into the Black Stars offensive unit on Monday. .Tournament favourites Brazil, in search of their sixth World Cup, are fresh off a 2-0 win over Serbia as they prepare to take on a Swiss team which cruised to a lacklustre 1-0 victory over Cameroon last week. .Switzerland, ranked 15th, face a steep challenge squaring off against number one-ranked Brazil on Monday, though they will be without star player Neymar. .The two teams have drawn on two prior occasions, most recently 1-1 at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and 2-2 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. .Brazil could make history if they can manage a win on Monday. .They are undefeated in their past 16 World Cup group-stage matches — dating back almost a quarter-century when they were beaten by Norway in 1998. No team has ever gone to 17 group-stage matches without defeat. .Brazil’s 25-year-old striker Richarlison is fresh off a solid two-goal performance against Serbia, bringing his scoring tally to nine in seven appearances for the Seleção Canarinho. .Brazilian heavyweight Neymar will be notably absent from Monday’s lineup due to an ankle injury. He is expected to sit out two games. Brazil may struggle without him. .Arsenal co-captain Granit Xhaka has had a stellar season .A plucky Portugal, led by superstar striker Cristiano Ronaldo, are looking to punch their ticket to World Cup’s knockout stages with a win over Uruguay Monday night. .Uruguay, for their part, have not yet found the back of the net in Qatar — or the front of it for that matter — failing to register a shot on target in their scoreless draw with South Korea last week. A loss on Monday will severely narrow Uruguay’s odds of making it out of the group stages. .Uruguay, who knocked Portugal out of the 2018 World Cup in Russia with a 2-1 victory, are hoping for a repeat performance on Monday — but are equally wary of the “dangerous” Portuguese squad. .“About what happened four years ago, it’s a different match, we have different players, it will be a completely different match,” Uruguay’s coach Diego Alonso said at a news conference on Sunday. .He added: “Portugal [have] a very good squad, they have excellent players, they have a wonderful coach with wide experience. That makes them a dangerous team. On the other hand, we also have our own weapons. We will try to win, we will bring our A game.” .Despite his recent struggles and controversies at the club level, Ronaldo soared in Portugal’s 3-2 victory over Ghana, becoming the first men’s football player in history to score in five World Cups. He will be hungry on Monday to secure Portugal’s spot in the final 16. .“United and focused. Towards our goal,” Ronaldo tweeted on Sunday in anticipation of the showdown with Uruguay. . .Seasoned Uruguay strikers Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani are La Celeste’s best shot at hitting back at a menacing Portuguese offence. .Diego Godin will also be eager to add an offensive spark. He had one of Uruguay’s best chances in its 0-0 draw with South Korea, nearly putting the team on the scoreboard with a header that ricocheted off the post. .View the full 2022 World Cup schedule here and be sure to visit Al Jazeera’s AI match predictor to see how your team is projected to perform in Qatar.",342
343,Published On 28 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Portugal v Uruguay match preview,,".Who: Portugal vs Uruguay .Where: Lusail Stadium .When: Monday, November 28, 10pm (19:00 GMT) .FIFA ranking: Portugal (9), Uruguay (14) .Uruguay midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur says the two-time former champions are relishing their status as underdogs as they prepare to face Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal at the World Cup on Monday. .If that comment on Sunday reflected quiet confidence, there is a reason for it. .Four years ago, an Edinson Cavani brace helped the South Americans stun the then-European champions 2-1 in the last 16 of the World Cup. Portugal were the favourites ahead of that game too. .And following their drab 0-0 draw with South Korea on Thursday, La Celeste – as Uruguay are known – are once again looking forward to trying to overturn the odds in their Group H clash. .“We respect everyone, but the less you know about Uruguay the better it turns out for us,” said Tottenham player Bentancur. “It’s better not to attract attention, to be humble, respect our opponents, and play all the same. .“At the last World Cup we did it really well, starting from behind.” .Indeed, much attention will be focused on Portugal’s impressive array of attacking talent that includes João Félix, Rafael Leão, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva, as well as Ronaldo. The Portugal talisman’s goal against Ghana made him the first player to have scored in five World Cups. .In veteran centre-back Pepe, 39, Portugal have one of the most experienced players in the tournament. Coach Fernando Santos said Pepe would play on Monday, which would make him the second-oldest outfield player ever to appear in a World Cup match, after Cameroon great Roger Milla. .Bentancur is looking forward to coming up against the Brazilian-born Porto defender. .“We all know Pepe, I played against him in 2018, he’s a great player, he’s had an incredible career,” said Bentancur. .“Playing him will be a good test for us, but we also have our weapons. They have experience, we do too, and we’ll try to attack their weaknesses.” .Portugal have identified midfielder Federico Valverde as Uruguay’s danger man. .“He’s a tough player to stop. He is a good team player, a strong player,” said Bernardo. “He’s one of the best midfielders in the world, not just with the ball but without the ball too. He does a lot to create space for his teammates.” .Valverde, 24, was named man of the match against South Korea in his first-ever World Cup match and has already won the Champions League and La Liga with Real Madrid. .He has really kicked on this season, scoring more goals in 20 matches than in his previous 148 games for the club across four campaigns. “He’s still the same lad, humble, a companion, always participating very naturally,” said Uruguay coach Diego Alonso. “His performance is stupendous, extraordinary, we’re very happy to have him.” .The Portuguese will qualify for the second round if they beat Uruguay. But if Uruguay win, they will leapfrog Ronaldo’s side in the points table, and bolster their own chances of qualifying for the Round of 16. If that happens, they won’t be underdogs any more.",343

His second point, a stunning acrobatic right-footed volley, is arguably the goal of the tournament so far. .Switzerland will certainly be encouraged by Serbia’s first-half defensive display, which kept Brazil at bay and required a moment of individual brilliance to break the deadlock. .Brazil are ranked number one in the world but lacked any real flair and creativity against a lacklustre Serbia, which failed to offer any real moments of excitement. .Switzerland are hardworking and disciplined and have been difficult to beat in recent years. They famously knocked out France at Euro 2020, leaving the world champions fighting among themselves as they exited the tournament. .Here in Qatar, Switzerland beat Cameroon 1-0 in a cagey first game. Breel Embolo scored the match’s only goal after a perfect pass across the box from former Liverpool and Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri. .Brazil are favourites for this match, but without the creativity of Neymar, they might struggle against a Swiss team that boasts a sturdy defence and some impressive results in recent months, including wins against Spain and Portugal. .Danilo will also miss the game for Brazil after picking up an injury. The 39-year-old Dani Alves is set to take his spot at right back. Manchester United’s Fred will likely be brought in to provide some defensive cover. .Brazil could make history if they avoid defeat to Switzerland. They are undefeated in their previous 16 World Cup group-stage games, last losing nearly a quarter-century ago in the first round to Norway in 1998. No team has ever gone 17 group-stage matches without a defeat. .The two teams have met at two previous World Cups in 1950 and 2018 with both matches ending in a draw. If either Brazil or Switzerland break that pattern on Monday, they’re guaranteed a spot in the next round.",344

Will they do the same to the South Koreans?",".Who: South Korea vs Ghana, Group H .When: Monday at 4pm (13:00 GMT) .Where: Education City Stadium, Al Rayyan .FIFA rankings: South Korea 28, Ghana 61 .When the final whistle blew, Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa bowed his head and solemnly walked off the pitch. It was an uncharacteristic reaction for someone who had finished his World Cup debut on the winning side. Ghana forward Inaki Williams was responsible for Costa’s moroseness. .Just moments earlier, Costa had been caught out by Williams when taking a goal kick. Williams had lingered behind at the goal and pounced on Costa the minute he put the ball down. Williams’ wiliness took Portugal by surprise, and out of nothing, he had an empty goal to fire into. But that’s where his luck ran out. He slipped as he won the ball, and his tame shot didn’t even reach the goal. .Tournament football hinges heavily on margins. Had Williams not slipped, Ghana would have made it 3-3. All four teams in the group would then have had one point. But he did, and as a result, the Black Stars enter their next game against South Korea pointless and bottom of their group. Margins. .Coming in as the lowest-ranked team of the tournament, little was expected of this Ghanian side. But what they lack in quality, they make up for in tenacity. They pushed Portugal to the hilt and were unfortunate to not come away with at least a point. .Ghana, led by their tireless captain, André Ayew, showed in their first game that they aren’t going to be pushovers. Mohammed Kudus, the 22-year-old Ajax midfielder, is the X factor of this Ghanaian side, and his sharp movements created problems for Portugal. .But questions remain over their defence, which capitulated in the second half. Portugal’s three goals flattered their performance on the night. .Ghana now play a side that failed to have a shot on target in their opening game – but has the pace to trouble Ghana. .South Korea’s goalless draw against Uruguay was the first time that both sides have failed to have a shot on target in a World Cup match this century. .The Taeguk Warriors’ defensive quartet of Kims deserve credit for keeping a clean sheet against an attack featuring Darwin Nunez, Luis Suarez, Federico Valverde and Edinson Cavani. Ayew and his team will have their work cut out for them against this South Korea side, which has prevented its opponents from scoring in its last three games and has conceded just six goals in its last eight games. .Son Heung-min sported a mask in the game against Uruguay, but South Korea’s superhero was largely ineffective. While he has struggled for form this season for Tottenham, he remains South Korea’s most potent force and has scored four goals in his last seven appearances for his country. South Korea’s pace is their key strength. .It’s a crunch game for both sides. A win would boost South Korea’s chances of qualification and they would be able to enter their final game against a fancied Portugal with the comfort of already having four points on the board. .Ghana need to avoid defeat to remain in the competition. They take on Uruguay in a tantalising final group game, in which they’ll be looking to exact revenge for Suarez’s handball clearance in the 2010 World Cup quarter-final. .That added motivation could help carry them over the finish line against Uruguay if they start that game with their qualification chances intact. The possibilities are exquisite. .For that, they need to first secure points against South Korea, against whom Ghana hold the edge in their head-to-head record, having won four of the seven games they’ve played. The last time they met, Jordan Ayew’s hat-trick led Ghana to a 4-0 win. .Both sides would likely settle for a narrower win this time. Once again, it could come down to the margins.",345

And if Monday’s game is anything like that seven-goal thriller – when Serbia’s four edged Cameroon’s three – we’ll all be in for a treat. .Vincent Aboubakar played for Cameroon that day as a fresh-faced 18-year-old. Now, 12 years later, he is captaining his country on football’s biggest stage. The veteran striker is used to Gulf conditions, having joined Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr FC last year. .He’s supported by goalkeeper André Onana and star midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa who both play in the Italian Serie A. Anguissa is the team’s defensive linchpin with an eye for the occasional goal. If he can find form, we could be expecting some fireworks on Monday. .Serbia’s muscular stature, however, poses a tough match to Cameroon’s flair. .Sergej Milinković-Savić, commanding midfield, links up with the devastating pairing of Aleksandar Mitrović and Dušan Vlahović up front, to form a dangerous strike team. And that’s without mentioning Fiorentina striker Luka Jović. .It’s a make-or-break game for both sides, coming off the back of losses in their opening matches: Cameroon to Switzerland and Serbia to Brazil. A second defeat for either would leave them on the brink of elimination from the World Cup. .Coach Dragan Stojković’s men will want a physical, aggressive game, but will need to keep their discipline. .Brazil managed to unpick Serbia in their first World Cup match in Qatar by constant prodding and poking, eventually prising open holes in their formation. Cameroon are unlikely to offer quite the brilliance and dominance of the five-time world champions, but Serbia can still be undone if they are not vigilant. .Cameroon had the best of the first half in their opening match against Switzerland on Thursday, showing they pose a threat on goal against even robust opposition. .Off the pitch, FIFA is investigating photographs that appeared to show a Serbian nationalist flag hanging in the team’s dressing room for that Brazil game last week. The outline of Kosovo can be seen on the flag under the Serbian national colours, which are emblazoned with the inscription: “We do not surrender.” .Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, has been a member of FIFA and EUFA – European football’s governing body – since 2016. .On Monday, Serbia will want to leave that controversy behind when they take the field. Or Cameroon may well make them pay.",346
347,Published On 28 Nov 2022,In the neighbourhood of Cameroon legend Samuel Eto’o,"The Cameroon star’s roots are in the impoverished community of New Bell, where they remember a prodigious child playing.",".Douala, Cameroon – There is a small football field in the district of New Bell that, at first glance, is not much to look at. The approximately 100-metre-long (330 feet) pitch is rough, unkempt, replete with puddles and bookended by small wooden goalposts dressed in torn green nets. .The field is not only a symbol of the impoverished nature of New Bell, but it also reveals the community’s deep attachment to the beautiful game. After all, it is the place where football legend Samuel Eto’o first learned to play. .At a very young age, his family moved here from Cameroon’s political capital, Yaounde – where he was born. Friends and community members watched Eto’o grow from a boy who kicked a ball around in the streets to one of the world’s most lethal strikers. .Dominique Essindi, a childhood friend, also grew up here and lives just a stone’s throw from the pitch, a constant reminder of their childhood. At 48, he still clearly remembers the matches he played with his competitive friend Eto’o before they were teenagers. .“Samuel never liked defeat,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that back then, neighbourhoods played each other in what is locally called Interquarter Football. .“I remember we had a match at Ecole Publique de New Bell Bassa, and he came late when we were two goals down. He wanted to enter the pitch, but the coach kept him on the bench. Eto’o was furious. But when he entered, he played exceptionally well and even scored a goal. The match finally ended in a draw.” .Initially, Essindi revealed, the community thought at the time that Eto’o‘s friends were more likely to break through. Not many imagined he would become a global star. .“People thought his friends, Ghislain Chameni, Jean Ondoa and even his younger brother David Eto’o would grow up to be better players,” he said. .But through robust training, hard work and determination, Essindi admitted, Eto’o‘s success was assured. “He had a New Bell mindset – never give up, despite tough times,” Essindi added. .“Eto’o wasn’t afraid to suffer. That has been his driving force ’til today. He has the mindset of a winner who knows where he’s from.” .Essindi, who prides himself on being one of the best defenders in New Bell in his early days, is among those who did recognise Eto’o’s football potential. Eto’o‘s ability to control the ball, dribble and score breathtaking goals was apparent before he played later for FC Barcelona or Inter Milan. He displayed these skills first in his home country as a striker for teams including Union Camerounaise de Brasseries (UCB) in 1996. .“We believed Samuel Eto’o would become a big player in this country, when he played in the quarter-final against the great Tonnerre Kalara Club of Yaounde in the Cup of Cameroon,” Essindi recalled. “Eto’o, very young and slim at the time, singlehandedly helped UCB thrash Tonnerre in the two-legged encounter. That was when we knew that boy had great potential.” .Eto’o told CNN during an interview in 2020 that he grew up at the hands of the people in this neighbourhood and that elders took care of him and advised him because they felt he had something and could end up successful. .New Bell is a place reputed for delinquency. Its enduring legacy, the Douala New Bell Prison, is a facility built in 1902 for a capacity of 800 inmates, but now holds more than that. .“If we go a little further, we will see that the Central Prison is nearby. It seemed more likely that I would end up in that prison,” Eto’o told CNN in 2020. .But the player did not end up there. Instead, he left Cameroon at 16, bound for Europe, where his illustrious career took off. .Eto’o‘s family lived in a modest house. The building, secured by a grey gate, has a fence that’s tiled mid-way. It is perched between a church and other small houses. Since Eto’o and his family left the neighbourhood, the apartment has been rented out. .In this neighbourhood in New Bell, it is no surprise to see laundry ropes tied against pillars, with clothes spread out in front of people’s homes. Some who live in buildings spread their washed clothes on guardrails. A few metres away from the former Eto’o family home is the residence of the leader of New Bell Block 10, Chief Emmanuel Tonye, who watched Eto’o play football as a young boy. .Sitting outside a local bar just beside his residence, the ruler reminisced about Eto’o‘s passion for the game. .“Eto’o … is a footballer created by God. He’s a born footballer. That’s because even though his mother was just a trader, he still dreamed of becoming a football player,” Tonye told Al Jazeera. “Just like other mothers [in New Bell], Eto’o‘s mother would beat him up and send him back home when she saw him playing football.” .At the time, he said, most parents in New Bell considered the sport a waste of time. .But now, things have changed. .“Thanks to Samuel Eto’o‘s image, some parents are now motivating their children to play football,” Raymond Mbeleck, who resides in New Bell, told Al Jazeera. “Today, everybody wants to be a footballer because they all dream of becoming an Eto’o someday. There are so many talented kids here who play the game. .Their icon, Eto’o, who retired from the game in 2019, has also accomplished another milestone in football management – becoming the president of the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot). His December 2021 victory signalled a new dawn for the sport in Cameroon, according to many New Bell residents. .“When the Fecafoot election results were released, the entire New Bell community was in a festive mood. There was joy everywhere; it was enormous and fantastic … People here in New Bell shouted from all corners of their homes,” Essindi said. .“We have always wanted Eto’o at the helm of Fecafoot,” Mbeleck added. “That’s because we knew he would change many things. I recently learned that some of our compatriots who played football abroad have returned to the country to play in the Cameroonian championship. This shows that Samuel Eto’o‘s presence in Fecafoot played a big role.” .At one point, Mbeleck added, Cameroonian football was going down the drain: “But in Eto’o‘s close-to-one-year stay at Fecafoot, we now see a bright future for football in this country.” .This is just one of the reasons the people of New Bell hold the football legend in such high esteem. .“He is a giver. He helps people in need and solves people’s problems here. We have many rich people in New Bell, but Eto’o is the only rich one who gives. He helps everyone without discrimination, we are always proud of Eto’o,” Tonye said. .As he speaks these words, people seated around him nod in agreement. It speaks volumes of how much the community values the man they call “The New Bell Kid”.",347
348,Published On 28 Nov 2022,‘Very proud’: Indonesia makes mark in Qatar with official ball,"Al Rihla, the official match ball for Qatar 2022, is being manufactured in Indonesia’s East Java province.",".Medan, Indonesia – Indonesia’s boys in red may not have qualified for the World Cup, but one Java-based company is leaving its mark as the maker of the tournament’s official souvenir match ball. .The souvenir Al Rihla, the official football for Qatar 2022, is being manufactured in Madiun Regency, East Java province, by PT Global Way. The local sporting goods manufacturer opened its factory in 2019 and employs more than 2,000 workers, according to the company’s website. .Ahmad Dawami, the regent of Madiun, said the football is a source of pride for the region and has provided a much-needed boost to the local economy since 2020. .“When we had the launch of the factory in 2020, we had an overwhelming sense of pride. The factory has been immeasurable for us,” Dawami told Al Jazeera. .Al Rihla, meaning “the journey” in Arabic, is being made in partnership with Adidas. PT Global Way also works with PUMA, UHLsport and Mizuno to produce sports equipment that is exported worldwide. .Dawami said that one million souvenir footballs have been made at the factory and will be sent to Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and the United Arab Emirates as part of the World Cup celebrations. .He said the factory and orders for millions of footballs have provided employment to thousands of young workers in Madiun during a precarious time for the economy amid challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics, the economy of Madiun grew 3.34 percent from 2020 to 2021, something which Dawami credits in part to the factory. .Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has championed the export of the footballs, saying it gives the people of East Java a chance to “become part of the world’s economic resonance”. .East Java is known as a hub of commerce, contributing more than 15 percent of Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to government statistics. Yet, while East Java has always been known for its large-scale industries, such as shipbuilding, paper milling and cement manufacturing, Dawami said that the pandemic had raised fears of economic slowdown and widespread job cuts. .“Fortunately, the factory became our symbol of the economy recovering after the pandemic,” Dawami said. “We feel now as if the region has had new life breathed into it. The factory and the World Cup has provided a consistent source of work.” .Dawami, a Liverpool supporter, said that Madiun Regency is keen not to be left out of the excitement and, despite Indonesia’s absence from the field, watch parties have been organised so residents can enjoy the games. .Al Rihla is the 14th official World Cup ball and, according to FIFA, the fastest and most accurate ball yet. The ball features a panel design inspired by a Dhow, a traditional Arab boat, with a blue, red, and yellow colour scheme that is meant to represent the landscape of Qatar. .The Al Rihla balls are also the first World Cup ball made exclusively with water-based ink and glue, which are less harmful to the environment. .“Al Rihla’s worldwide journey will represent the incredible reach of the FIFA World Cup and give fans a unique opportunity to engage with the event,” said Jean-François Pathy, FIFA’s director of marketing. .Ilham, 23, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, has been working at the factory for the past five months after struggling to find employment opportunities elsewhere. .He said he enjoys his work and feels a sense of satisfaction making the balls used for such a high-profile event. .“I love watching and playing football,” Ilham, who glues the balls together, told Al Jazeera. “So, thank God, I’m so happy working in this job. It’s a really good thing for the local community to have an employment opportunity like this. I like it because I’ve made so many friends at the factory.” .Ignatius Indro, the head of the Indonesian National Team Supporters Association, said he is proud that an Indonesian product is achieving global recognition for its high quality. .“As supporters of Indonesia’s national team, we are proud of the Al Rihla ball. Yes, even though our national team has not been able to attend the World Cup this time, our local products have still gone global,” he said. .Indro said the Indonesian government has worked hard in recent years to market Indonesian products to the world to rival regional peers such as Vietnam and China, and the World Cup is an important stage for Indonesia to show its wares. .“We have world-class apparel that is no less good than that of other brands. This makes us very proud,” he added. .Now, Indro said, Indonesia’s national team just needs to match the success of the country’s sporting apparel to take to the pitch at the next World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico in 2026. Indonesia has not qualified for the competition since gaining independence, with its sole appearance in 1938 taking place under the banner of the Dutch East Indies. .“We as fans hope this can also spur the achievements of our national team in the future,” he said.",348
349,Published On 28 Nov 2022,World Cup fans remind Germany of racism towards ex-teammate Ozil,Images of Mesut Ozil were displayed at the Germany vs Spain game following the German side’s protest over the ban on ‘One Love’ armband from World Cup.,".Football fans in Qatar have appeared to hit back at the German team’s World Cup protest over the ban on “One Love” armbands by holding pictures of Germany’s former team player Mesut Ozil who became a target of racist abuse in Germany. .The group of fans at the Spain vs Germany match on Sunday covered their mouths while holding copies of hand-drawn sketches of Ozil and pictures of him in action for Germany. .The coordinated display was apparently in response to the German team players’ protest gesture last week when they covered their mouths during a pre-game photo to protest against the FIFA — world football’s governing body — clampdown on “One Love” armbands at the World Cup. .In covering their mouths, the fans on Sunday appeared to be referencing Germany’s own questionable treatment of Ozil, their former player who quit the German national team after becoming a target of racist abuse and a scapegoat for Germany’s early World Cup exit in 2018. . .Ozil, a German-born descendant of Turkish immigrants, accused Germany’s football federation, fans and media of racism in their treatment of people with Turkish roots. .“I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,” Ozil said at the time of his departure from the German national team. .Ozil was considered one of the greatest midfielders of his generation and his surprise retirement from the German team in 2018 caused shockwaves. .“It is with a heavy heart and after much consideration that because of recent events, I will no longer be playing for Germany at international level whilst I have this feeling of racism and disrespect,” he wrote on Twitter at the time. .“I used to wear the German shirt with such pride and excitement, but now I don’t … Racism should never, ever be accepted.” .Ozil also cited statements from German politicians, racist taunts from fans and hate mail as examples of the hostile climate he and his family faced leading up to his decision. .The abuse started before the 2018 World Cup when Ozil and Germany teammate Ilkay Gundogan posed for photographs with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Gundogan also has a Turkish family background. He was subsequently jeered by German supporters during a World Cup warmup game. .The abuse of Ozil, in particular, increased after the tournament, helped by incendiary statements from Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff and the federation president at the time, Reinhard Grindel. .Grindel later said he should have given Ozil more support. .After playing in Sunday’s game at Al Bayt Stadium, in which Germany and Spain drew 1-1, Gundogan said he just wanted to focus on football from now on. .“Honestly, my point of view is: now the politics are finished,” Gundogan said. .“The country of Qatar is very proud to host the World Cup, also the first Muslim country, and I come from a Muslim family. So the Muslim community is proud. So I think now it’s just about football.”",349
350,Published On 28 Nov 2022,"World Cup recap, Day 8: Morocco beats Belgium, Germany still in","Morocco wins over Belgium, Japan in surprise defeat to Costa Rica, Croatia knocks out Canada, Germany draws with Spain.",".Day eight of the World Cup in Qatar has delivered another shock to the footballing world with Morocco scoring a stunning victory over Belgium, beating the Belgians 2-0 at Al Thumama Stadium and putting the Atlas Lions a step closer to qualifying for the Round of 16. .Germany has earned a crucial 1-1 draw in their exciting and energetic match against Spain after the Germans had teetered on the brink of elimination in the group stage for their second World Cup in a row. Their draw with Spain combined with Japan’s surprise loss to Costa Rica now moves the Germans into more positive territory for qualification. .And it was a surprise 1-0 win by Costa Rica over Japan in a game where Los Ticos had been mostly on the defensive until putting away a goal in the 81st minute that now keeps their qualification hopes alive. .Canada were not so lucky, as their 4-1 defeat to Croatia means they are out of the World Cup. .Here is a quick guide recapping all you need to know from day eight — Sunday, November 27 — of the Qatar World Cup 2022. .Going into their game against Costa Rica on Sunday, Japan knew they could have sealed their spot in the Round of 16 if they defeated the Costa Ricans, who had suffered a 7-0 thrashing by Spain in their first game of the tournament. .The four-time Asian champions, who stunned Germany with a 2-1 win in their Group E opener, squandered a perfect chance to advance to the tournament’s next phase. .Japan looked sluggish, static and out of ideas on how to beat a Costa Rica side that went for a rigid back-five defence to prevent goals getting past. The Samurai Blue had controlled the ball 57 percent of the match, had five corner kick opportunities and put three shots on goal, but they just could not take advantage of their domination of the pitch and play. .Then came Costa Rica’s Keysher Fuller with a surprise goal in the 81st minute that gave Los Ticos their 1-0 victory over the much favoured Japan at Al Rayyan, Qatar. Fuller’s goal was the first shot on target by Costa Rica in the match. .The loss has denied Japan a chance to move straight to the group of 16 knockout stage of the tournament. .Still bruised by their 7-0 defeat to Spain, Costa Rica now has an improbable chance to advance out of the group stage. With two matches down, Costa Rica and Japan now have three points each. .Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu said after the match that he believes his team still have a shot at the Round of 16 despite their dismal 1-0 defeat to Costa Rica. .The Samurai Blue can still qualify for the next round, but will need to pull off another feat of giant slaying when they meet Spain on Thursday, a scenario made far less likely by Sunday’s tepid showing in Al Rayyan. .“Against Spain we are going for the win and that’s what we need to focus on,” Moriyasu told a news conference. .“The next match against Spain will be a very intense game. We need to improve the odds for Japan,” Moriyasu added. .Japan have been a permanent fixture at the World Cup since debuting in 1998 and have reached the last 16 three times, more than any other Asian side. .Moriyasu said he would approach the Spain game differently and analyse how they performed against Germany in Sunday’s later Group E match. .“We have respect for them. Spain are a young team but I believe there’s a good chance we can win; with confidence, we will go for the next match.” .Morocco pulled off another World Cup shock on Sunday by defeating Belgium 2-0. .Sunday’s win by Morocco was the second big upset involving an Arabic nation at the first World Cup in the Middle East. It follows Saudi Arabia’s stunning defeat of Argentina in the opening set of group games. .Morocco, roared on by thunderous noise from its fans at Al Thumama Stadium, went into the game on Sunday knowing they had started in Qatar with a promising 0-0 draw with Croatia. .But, the Atlas Lions had to make a change right before kickoff when goalkeeper Yassine Bounou felt unwell. The North Africans were unaffected and went on to clinch their first win at a World Cup since 1998 and only their third ever. .Morocco captain Romain Saiss gave his team the lead with a barely noticeable deflection off his hip after a free kick from Abdelhamid Sabiri in the 73rd minute that got under the body of the Belgian goalkeeper. Sabiri was initially credited with the goal from his free kick, but FIFA later amended the official match report to give it to Saiss. .Morocco’s Zakaria Aboukhlal guided a shot into the roof of the net off a pass from Hakim Ziyech in stoppage time to make it 2-0 as Belgium’s defence was beaten by a speedy 22-year-old forward playing at his first World Cup. .“We are delighted with that after Croatia and Belgium,” Morocco coach Walid Regragui said after the match. .“That’s absolutely outstanding for Morocco.” .Morocco has moved to four points and Croatia is also on four points after beating Canada later on Sunday. Belgium has three points, and Canada has been eliminated. .Morocco has only ever been past the group stage once at a World Cup, in 1986. .Their 2-0 win now leaves Belgium in peril of a group-stage exit at what is likely the final World Cup for a highly-talented group of Belgian players known as the ageing “Golden Generation”. .Belgium could have become the second team behind defending champion France to advance to the last 16 if it had beaten Morocco. Belgium now drops from first to third in Group F and will next play against 2018 World Cup finalist Croatia and try to avoid its earliest elimination from a World Cup since 1998. .The final group games are on Thursday, when Morocco will come back to Al Thumama Stadium to play Canada. Belgium will face Croatia at the same time. .Croatia scored a 4-1 victory on Sunday over Canada, who have now been eliminated after two matches at the World Cup in Qatar. .Croatia’s hackles were up going into the match after Canada coach John Herdman had said ahead of the game that his side were going to “eff” them, a pithy comment that undoubtedly supplied the script for his counterpart Zlatko Dalic’s team talk ahead of the match. .But the early stages of the contest suggested Canada were the ones who had been given the pre-match rocket and the game opened with Canada putting away the first score when Alphonso Davies headed in a goal a little more than a minute into play. .Davies, who plays for Bayern Munich, headed a cross from Tajon Buchanan just out of goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic’s reach 1 minute and 8 seconds into the game. The goal had the swath of red-shirted Canadian fans chanting “Can-a-da! Can-a-da!” at Khalifa International Stadium. .Yet it was a first half in two parts, as Croatia — thoroughly outplayed in the early stages — eventually shifted into gear. Croatia’s Andrej Kramaric appeared to score the equaliser for Croatia in the 26th minute, but he was ruled offside. His second chance counted about 10 minutes later, making it 1-1. .Marko Livaja put Croatia in front with a blast from outside the penalty box in the 44th minute, Kramaric added his second in the 70th, and Lovro Majer scored in stoppage time. .The victory moved Croatia to the top of Group F on four points. They now need only a draw in their final game on Thursday against third-placed Belgium, who are a point behind, to be guaranteed a spot in the Round of 16. .“We made a small step here but we are far from our ultimate goal,” said Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic. “Croatia demonstrated power, strength and quality and nobody is happier than me about that.” .The defeat means Canada can not advance out of the group stage. .Canada coach Herdman said the experience of Qatar had set his team in the right direction for 2026, when Canada co-hosts the World Cup with the United States and Mexico. .“I’m proud of what they achieved tonight, which was to make some history for our country,” Herdman said. .Germany’s substitute Niclas Fullkrug’s close-range goal on Sunday was described as rescuing Germany, who took away a 1-1 draw against Spain in their World Cup Group E showdown. .The match was one of the most anticipated of this year’s World Cup tournament and a loss would not have eliminated Germany immediately, but it would have left the team in a much more difficult position to advance. .Spain had the better of the first half and looked more likely to break through with the flair and style of their younger players. The Spanish were rewarded for their efforts early in the second half when substitute Álvaro Morata put the team in the lead in the 62nd minute with a nice one-touch from close range after a well-placed low cross from teammate Jordi Alba. .Germany only threatened sporadically with a few breakaways and set pieces, but the team improved gradually and eventually, Füllkrug scored in the 83rd minute to give Germany a 1-1 draw at Al Bayt Stadium. .Germany’s fate will be decided on Thursday against Costa Rica, who defeated Japan 1-0 earlier on Sunday. But even a win may not be enough for Germany, who lost to Japan in their opener and are in last place in Group E. They need the other results to go their way. .“I hope this will give us a boost,” German coach Hansi Flick said, adding that he was satisfied with the result and his team’s attitude. “We know that this was the first step and we want to see against Costa Rica if we can craft the conditions to go through to the Round of 16.” .Spain coach Luis Enrique said the draw was not a bad result for Spain. .“We are still leaders of the group of death,” Luis Enrique said. “We still depend on ourselves and a draw will be enough against Japan, but we will try to go and win that match.” .Germany’s draw leaves Spain top of the group and needing just a single point against Japan to guarantee a spot in the final 16 of the tournament. .Germany, who lost 2-1 in their opener against Japan, are at the bottom of the table on one point. .The Germans now need to win against Costa Rica on Thursday, and their hopes then depend on Japan losing against Spain. If Japan draw with Spain on Thursday, it will all come down to goal difference.",350
351,Published On 27 Nov 2022,Qatar 2022: Who needs to do what to get to the Round of 16?,All the group permutations you need to know.,".Each nation dreams of lifting the World Cup. Not one squad has come to Qatar just for the fun of it — they are all in it to win. .But the first stage of eliminations is nearly upon us as the tournament’s group stage draws to a close. Half of the 32 teams that started in Qatar will be packing their bags and heading home. .So, who needs what to survive into the Round of 16? .Group A .Host nation Qatar, finding themselves fourth of four in their group, had the ignominious honour of being the first team knocked out of this year’s tournament. But at least they do not have far to get home. .The Netherlands have now qualified, following their 2-0 win over Qatar in the group’s final game. Senegal narrowly beat Ecuador 2-1 on Tuesday afternoon to take the second qualifying spot for the Round of 16, while Ecuador join Qatar in elimination. .Group B .This was always likely to be the most competitive group as well as the most politically charged. The remaining matches see old rivals and geopolitical enemies facing off, and any of the four teams can still qualify, even if Wales — in their first World Cup since 1958 — only stand a mathematical chance. .England top the table with four points from two games. Iran are second with three, after two injury-time goals against Wales on Friday. The United States are third in the group table with two points from two draws, while Wales have the toughest battle for qualification with just one point. .Group C .This is another open group in which all four teams could still qualify. Mexico have just one point at the bottom of the group table, while Saudi Arabia and their shock victims Argentina have three points each. Poland, with four points, lead the group but they are not safe yet. .Group D .World champions France, with six points from two games, were the first team in Qatar to book their place in the Round of 16. That makes the rest of the group permutations a little less confusing. .Australia have three points, while Denmark and Tunisia have one each. .Group E .Everyone expected Spain and Germany to sail through Group E. And everyone was half-right, at least, with Spain cruising comfortably at the top with four points from two games. Germany, however, languish at the bottom of the group, as coach Hansi Flick’s mission to recover Germany’s pre-2018 football glory appears a longer-term project than first hoped for. .Japan and Costa Rica have three points each after their meeting on Sunday, meaning any of the four teams could still qualify. .Group F .Canada were the second team to be booking their flights home. That means Croatia, Morocco and Belgium can still qualify. The Belgians, ranked second in the world, were expected to top this group, but their 2-0 mauling by Morocco on Sunday changed everything. .Group G .Brazil’s win over Switzerland put the five-times world champions through with a game to spare. The Swiss, having also picked up a win in their first game, are most likely to follow suit. But Cameroon and Serbia both still stand a chance after their entertaining draw did neither any real favours. .  .Group H .Portugal joined the Round of 16 with their 2-0 win over Uruguay on Monday, though the rest of the group is still wide open.",351
352,Published On 27 Nov 2022,Iran lodges protest with FIFA over US Soccer flag post,Iranian football federation slams ‘unprofessional act’ as US football body uses modified flag in social media posts.,".Iran’s football federation says it has lodged a complaint to FIFA over the removal of the word “Allah” from the Islamic Republic’s flag on social media posts by its counterpart in the United States, ahead of an upcoming World Cup game between the two countries. .“In an unprofessional act, the Instagram page of the US football federation removed the Allah symbol from the Iranian flag,” state news agency IRNA reported on Sunday. .“The Iran Football Federation sent an email to FIFA to demand it issue a serious warning to the US federation,” it added. .There was no immediate public response from world football’s governing body to the reported complaint, which came as the US prepares to face Iran in a decisive World Cup match on Tuesday — a fixture already burdened by the decades of enmity between the countries. .The US and Iran cut diplomatic relations in 1980. .The United States Soccer Federation (USSF) said in a statement on Sunday morning it had decided to forego the official flag on social media accounts in a show of solidarity with the “women in Iran fighting for basic human rights” in the wake of the death of 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in police custody.
The Islamic Republic’s flag consists of three horizontal bands in red, white and green with the word “Allah” appearing in stylised script in the middle. .The Twitter account of the US men’s team displayed a banner with the squad’s matches in the group stage, with the Iranian flag only bearing its green, white and red colours. The same was seen in a post on its Facebook and Instagram accounts laying out the point totals so far in its group. .By Sunday afternoon, the normal flag with the emblem had been restored in the Twitter banner, and the Facebook and Instagram posts with the altered flag had been removed. .“We wanted to show our support for the women in Iran with our graphic for 24 hours,” the federation said. .The United Nations says more than 300 people have been killed amid a crackdown on the protests which erupted in the wake of Amini’s death in September, and some 14,000 have been arrested, including children. Iran has accused the US and other foreign states of fomenting the demonstrations, without providing evidence. .Iran’s Tasnim news agency said on Twitter that the US team had “breached the FIFA charter, for which a 10-game suspension is the appropriate penalty”. .The US team “should be kicked out” of the World Cup, it added. . .It is not expected that FIFA will take any such action. .Meanwhile, the two nations’ prospects on the pitch at the World Cup remain finely posed. .Iran’s dramatic 2-0 win over Wales and the US team’s tense goalless stalemate against England on Friday set up a tantalising final round of Group B matches. .England, sitting top with four points, face the bottom side Wales, meaning the Iran-United States contest will decide which team goes through to the round of 16. .The eagerly awaited meeting is a rematch of the 1998 World Cup group stage contest, dubbed the “mother of all games”, which Iran won 2-1. In a symbolic moment before that match at Lyon’s Stade Gerland, the Iranian players gave white roses, a symbol of peace in the country, to their American opponents.",352

A powerful seventh-minute effort from Dani Olmo was forced onto the crossbar by Germany’s Manuel Neuer. .Antonio Rudiger did find the net for Germany with a powerful headed free-kick conversion – but the goal was ruled offside by VAR. .Spain were rewarded for their creativity early in the second half. Substitute Alvaro Morata beat his marker and flicked the ball in at the near post past goalkeeper Neuer following a low cross from Jordi Alba in the 62nd minute to give Spain the lead. .Head coach Hanzi Flick rang the changes, swapping out three players. Just 13 minutes after coming on, Niclas Fullkrug equalised for the Germans in the 83rd minute, smashing home a loose ball inside the box. .From then until the six minutes of added time were complete, both teams had chances to win in a frantic finish, but had to settle for a draw. .“Germany have an amazing team, and I think it was an amazing game. [With these] two teams, it could have been a semifinal or a final of a World Cup,” Morata told BBC Sport after the game. .“The most important thing is to win, and tonight they scored an amazing goal, and we were unlucky not to have the win, but tomorrow we go back into training.” .The result was “fair, against a very tough Spanish side”, Germany’s Ilkay Gundogan told the BBC after the match. .“And now it’s all about the final game of the group. In a World Cup, you already know it’s going to be dramatic, full of ups and downs, and then the way Niclas [Fullkrug] scored – the finish was unbelievable, a typical number-nine, he stepped up when we needed [it].” .Their draw leaves Spain top of the group, needing just a point against Japan to guarantee a spot in the final 16 of the tournament. .Germany, who lost 2-1 in their opener against Japan, are at the bottom of the table on one point. They need to win against Costa Rica on Thursday and their hopes then depend on Japan losing. If Japan draw, it will all come down to goal difference.",354

Still, she wanted Morocco to win and predicted a 2-1 victory. .“I’m a little bit lost because my two nations are playing,” said Abajadi, who held a Berber flag for the indigenous group in North Africa. .Abajadi said she was divided over which team to support. But after hearing Belgian captain Kevin De Bruyne say in an interview that his team was “too old” to win at the World Cup, she was now hoping for a draw because of his pessimism. .“It’s because of Kevin I’ve changed my mind,” she said. .When the game began, the crowd quieted down. .“Allez Ziyech!” hollered the teenage boys dressed in all-black and hoodies sitting towards the back, referring to Morocco midfielder Hakim Ziyech. .Capital youth centre founder Hassan al Hilou, 23, himself of Iraqi-Dutch origin, said that one of the centre’s functions is to act as a safe space for people of different backgrounds to gather. .Throughout the match, al Hilou walked around with a big smile, occasionally yelling “Belgium!” good-naturedly teasing the viewers who largely supported Morocco. .Youssef Faraj, 40, a teacher and youth mentor at Capital overseeing the event, said he was cheering for Morocco but worried they weren’t playing at their best. .“We are outsiders. We are not contenders,” he said, noting that Belgium was ranked second in the tournament, while Morocco was ranked 22. .The crowd erupted when Ziyech scored on a free kick, but cheers turned to boos when the goal was called back due to an offside penalty. .At half time, Ayoub, 17, a tall high school student draped in a Moroccan flag, said he was very disappointed that Morocco was not awarded the goal. .“It was disrespectful. It was clearly a goal,” he said. “I feel sad.” .“The second half, we’re going to score two goals,” said Ayoub with conviction. He was easily one of the most dedicated and emotive Morocco fans in the audience. .Ayoub’s prediction turned out to be correct, and Morocco won the game 2-0, and the crowd at the youth centre cheered. .“We didn’t go to Qatar to show that we were bad. We came to Qatar to show Africa was there,” he said. That a “small club in Africa wins [against] a big club in Europe”. .As the room quickly thinned out, Ayoub joined his friends to celebrate and set off some red and green coloured flares for Morocco. The sounds of celebratory car honking could already be heard on the main road outside. .“We are going to say we are here – to say Morocco is not Belgium,” Ayoub said as he walked out, a bounce in his step and with a big holler. .Mesmaoui said she was happy that her 2-1 prediction was close. .“They [Morocco] tried to attack several times. Perseverance is the word of the day. They were very determined.” .For her friend Abajadi, it is also a victory for Belgo-Moroccans. .“Today Belgium is going to explode,” she said, referring to how it is an emotional win for Moroccans. “In any case, it was a win-win.”",357

Everyone said Belgium will humiliate us. But we beat them,” Othmane Benjelloun said, fighting back tears after Morocco stunned the Belgians 2-0. .“This is a dream for us. We were brave and did not sit back. We believed in our team and our players felt our strong support. What you see here is history,” he added, tears finally streaming down his cheeks. .The showdown was Morocco’s 18th World Cup match and their 14th against European opposition. The North Africans have won two and drawn six of their last 11 World Cup group-stage matches against European countries. .The last World Cup Morocco won was against Scotland in 1998. .The Belgium lineup was filled with household names: Manchester City’s midfield maestro Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings in the middle of the pitch; Real Madrid’s Thibaut Courtois, the reigning winner of the Yashin trophy given to the best-ranked goalkeeper in the world; and Courtois’s teammate Eden Hazard leading the attack. .But that did not deter the thousands of Atlas Lions fans clad in green and red – or their team. They felt it was their moment. They cheered, sang, and waved the blue-and-green national flag without a break. The noise inside the arena was eardrum-splitting. .“Amazing day. Our tactics were spot. We attacked at the right time and defended when we needed to. We got them tired,” said Adel Ez-Zaidi, who came from Frankfurt in Germany to watch the match. .“All day you could feel today will be special day. We were very positive even before kick-off. This means everything to all of us. It is like a very good dream. You don’t want it to end or wake up from it,” he added before rushing off to join fellow fans at the entertainment zone outside the stadium. .From the first whistle, it was clear the Moroccan players were up for the challenge of overcoming one of the tournament’s most feared teams. .They flew into the tackles and closed down the Belgians at every opportunity. Achraf Hakimi, the Paris Saint-Germain right-back, set the tone with his lung-busting runs, his long strides covering every inch of the green turf as they sought to break down the Belgian back line. .“These players, with their performance today, showed how much they care and how much it means to play for our country,” said Hanan Rahho, who flew in from Neuss in Germany for the showpiece. “Hakimi was everywhere. With players like we can go far. Anything is possible. It is very promising. I will not be surprised if we win the World Cup.” .“It is the best feeling ever. We didn’t just win but showed we deserved to win against a great team. I feel like crying,” she added, putting her hands over her face. .It was not only Moroccans who were rooting for the Atlas Lions to overcome Belgium. There were plenty of Tunisian, Palestinian, Saudi and Omani flags in the crowd cheering for the North Africans. .“It is wonderful what they did. I’m very proud of them. No one will ever forget this day. No single Arab will forget,” said Imad Azaizeh, a Palestinian who travelled from Dammam in Saudi Arabia to support Morocco. .“They are the dark horse of the World Cup. They can achieve anything they want and we will support them no matter what.” .Next up for Morocco is Canada on Thursday, and the fans celebrating at Al Thumama Stadium can’t wait for the showdown. .“Canada will not want to face us after they see how we played today. No team will want to face us. We are the lions from the Atlas Mountains,” Benjelloun said, wiping the tears of joy.",358

It was the earliest goal of the tournament so far and a historic moment for Canada –  their first-ever goal at a World Cup. .Despite the early setback, Croatia soon asserted themselves in the match, with Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic pulling the strings in midfield. In the 36th minute, they drew level when Ivan Perisic, a growing influence on the left wing, slid the ball through to Andrej Kramaric, who shot the first time into the far corner of the goal. .Croatia were buoyant and took the lead eight minutes later, when a lovely build-up from the back ended with Marko Livaja firing right-footed low into the net from the edge of the area after being fed by Kovacic. .Canada’s coach John Herdman rang the changes at halftime in an effort to claw back the initiative, and substitute Jonathan Osorio curled an effort just wide shortly after the restart. .Canada went close again when Jonathan David’s shot was superbly tipped over by Dominik Livakovic. .Yet, their hopes of getting back into the contest were dashed when a curling cross from Ivan Perisic on the left was controlled by Kramaric, who shifted the ball onto his left foot and dispatched it low into the bottom corner in the 70th minute to double his tally. .Lovro Majer netted in stoppage time via a breakaway counterattack as Canada continued to press for a consolation goal, wrapping up a victory that moved Croatia to the top of Group F on four points. .It was an especially sweet success for Croatia after Canada boss John Herdman irked Zlatko Dalic’s side with his profane attempt to inspire his players after a 1-0 defeat against Belgium in their group opener. .In a television interview, Herdman said he had told his players following the loss that “they belong” at the World Cup and were “going to go and ‘eff’ Croatia”. .Dalic had taken exception to Herdman’s rant, insisting on Saturday that his team deserved “respect” from their opponents. .Croatia now need only a draw in their final game on Thursday against third-placed Belgium, who are a point behind, to guarantee a knockout spot. .Canada, meanwhile, are now condemned to exit at the group stage after consecutive defeats in their opening two games. .They are also in action on Thursday when they will face Morocco, who are level with Croatia on four points but behind on goal difference. .The Canadians will be looking to finish their tournament on a high before hosting the next edition of the FIFA games in 2026, alongside the United States and Mexico.",359

They work the referee, you saw the bench always jumping up, always working the linesman, constantly in their ears, they’re constantly in your face. .“This is their culture. They kind of make you lose your focus, make you lose your concentration and what’s really important to you,” he said, adding that Queiroz fits in this pattern very well. . .In a post on his social media accounts, the Iranian coach hit back and said: “No matter how much I can respect what you did inside the pitch, those remarks about Iran Culture, Iran National Team and my Players are a disgrace to Football.” .He invited Klinsmann to visit the Team Melli camp to speak with the players and learn more about the team and the country’s culture. .“At the same time, we just want to follow with full attention what will be the decision of FIFA regarding your position as a member of Qatar 2022 Technical Study Group. Because, obviously, we expect you to resign before you visit our camp.” .A statement published on the Iranian football federation’s website on Sunday said the federation has called on FIFA to clarify the comments and on Klinsmann to resign. .The federation also made sneering comments about a controversial chapter of Germany’s presence at the 1982 World Cup, when it was accused of fixing a match against Austria in a way that both teams would advance. .“Since Klinsmann is a German, he is promised not to be judged for the most shameful chapter of World Cup history, the 1982 Disgrace of Gijón, when West Germany and Austria fixed a match, and he is also promised not to be judged for his infamous dramatic dives as a former player,” the statement said. . .On Sunday, Klinsmann said he wanted to “calm things down” with Queiroz, before adding that “there was stuff really taken out of context. I will try to give him a call and calm things down”. .“I have never criticised Carlos or the Iranian bench. Some even thought I was criticising the referee because he didn’t do anything about the way they were behaving on the bench,” he said on BBC Breakfast. .“All I described was their emotional way of doing things, which is actually admirable in a certain way. The whole bench lives the game. They’re jumping up and down and Carlos is a very emotional coach, he’s constantly on the sidelines trying to give his players all his energy and direction.” .Earlier, a clip of Klinsmann making the comments is also circulating on social media, with users criticising the former footballer as well as the BBC hosts for not only not challenging him but fervently agreeing with him. .Some users online pointed out that Klinsmann himself was so well-known for his flare for the dramatics during his playing time that his goal celebration was a fake dive. .They posted a clip of Klinsmann playing in the 1990 World Cup, where he is tackled by a defender and dives, prompting the referee to show a red card to the defender. .As Klinsmann is dramatically rolling on the ground and the medical team is called onto the pitch, a replay shows there was no contact between Klinsmann and the defender. . .The BBC has also come under fire for its World Cup coverage, with some users calling it “racist”. .Following Klinsmann’s comments, another pundit on-air asked him if the result in the Iran-Wales match would have gone differently had it been judged by a European referee. .Klinsmann agrees and points out that the referee was from Guatemala. At that moment, host Logan jumped in and enthusiastically pointed out that the linesman was also from Trinidad and Tobago. .This comes days after the BBC confirmed it received nearly 1,500 complaints over its coverage of the opening World Cup game between hosts Qatar and Ecuador. The BBC also came under fire for not airing the opening ceremony. .The win over Wales gave Iran three crucial points after a crushing 2-6 defeat to England in their opening match. .All now rests on the match on Friday against the United States, where a win would mean Iran will advance beyond the group stage for the first time in its World Cup history. .Earlier this week, the Iranian coach expressed his anger over political pressure on himself and his players as Iran continues to experience protests that began over 70 days ago after Mahsa Amini’s death in police custody. .Some fans have also been seen protesting at the World Cup.",364

We have loudspeakers, drums… the songs, the flutes. That’s all part of our culture, not something we’ve imported.” . .Al-Ittihad is one of the biggest Saudi clubs. Its Jeddah derby against Al-Ahli is one of the most hotly anticipated events in Saudi Arabia each year. .At those games, fans create an atmosphere that is among the most impressive in world football. .That explains Saudi fans’ passionate celebrations after the Argentina win – including a viral clip of a group dancing in joy to the 1997 dance track Freed from Desire. .Yasin says the scenes at the World Cup have been quite common in the Saudi league for years, a fervour now transferred to the national team. .“The fan groups have united,” Yasin said. “We sing along to our club teams tunes, but we’ve changed them to represent the national team. We’ve started to represent our national team more. Before we’d come with club shirts, now we’re all wearing the green of Saudi Arabia.” .“It’s organised. We have tifos [choreographed visual display] prepared beforehand, the colours, the chants. We get everything ready before we come. That has all come in the last 10 years. We’ve taken what we had traditionally and made it better.” .When Qatar was awarded the World Cup, it billed it as not just a tournament for itself, but for the Arab world and the Middle East as a whole. .That narrative took a knock during the boycott of Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. But since the end of the three-year boycott in 2021 and the restoration of ties between the countries, there has been evidence of it turning into a reality. .A World Cup in the region has allowed fans from not just Saudi Arabia, but also as far away as Morocco and Tunisia, to come and support their teams in numbers never seen before at a tournament. .Ali, a Bahraini who has just finished studying in Newcastle in the United Kingdom, says the World Cup has been a great opportunity for Saudis, and Arabs in general, to show off their own fan culture and educate people about it. .“The idea that we don’t have a football culture in the Gulf and in the Arab world is wrong, and this World Cup is the biggest piece of evidence,” Ali told Al Jazeera. “Saudi fans, in their love and support for football, are representing Arab fans in general. They’re a great representative. .“I think that it’ll get even better now after the World Cup and that Saudi Arabia can even host the World Cup in the future,” Ali added. .As for Saudi football, Rashid, who was also at the fan zone, says the developments in recent years, such as new academies for youth players, will only improve the league and the national team and further entrench the Ultras fan culture that has developed. .“Saudi football is developing, especially in recent years,” Rashid said. “There’s more attention on it, and youth players are being developed in organised national academies. We won’t benefit from this now, but much later down the line. It’s our job as fans to keep the culture of our support strong and keep pushing the team forward to more success.”",365
366,Published On 27 Nov 2022,Belgium v Morocco: Can’t choose ‘between my father and my mother’,"In the Belgian capital, some residents of Moroccan heritage say it is ‘hard to choose’ a side in the upcoming match.",".Brussels, Belgium – On a warm, blue-skied Sunday afternoon, Aït Ahmed Abdelouhad, 46, was kicking a football around a small concrete football field with his eight-year-old son. .Nearby, teenagers ran across a basketball court while others zoomed by on skateboards and families played table tennis in the park in the neighbourhood of Saint Gilles. .Abdelouhad, a sanitation worker with the local municipality, came to Belgium in 2005 from the Moroccan capital Rabat. .On November 27, his country of origin and the country he now calls home will face each other at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .The last – and only – time Belgium’s Red Devils and Morocco’s Atlas Lions played each other in the World Cup was in the US in 1994. Morocco lost. .Abdelouhad, who was wearing track pants and a cap, was unequivocal about which team he will support. “Morocco, of course, my country,” he said. .But if Morocco gets knocked out, he’ll support Belgium. “They play well. They have good players,” he said, referring to footballers like Manchester City superstar Kevin De Bruyne, considered one of the best midfielders of his generation. He’s also a fan of Argentina. .Abdelouhad said it was natural that he would support the Red Devils. “This country has given me a lot,” he said, smiling, a band on one wrist saying Belgium. “I’m happy, I have a job. My son is at school with his friends.” .Nearly 20 percent of Belgium’s more than 11.5 million people are of foreign origin, with roughly 500,000 people of Moroccan descent, constituting the country’s largest non-European Union population and one of the largest Moroccan diasporas. .For people in Belgium with identities linked to both countries, the choice of which team to support is not always an easy one and for some, it seems less about picking a side than the order in which to support the two national teams. .In another park nearby, Nassim Chouirfa, a 26-year-old software engineer, was sitting with two leaders from a local Muslim scouts group and 10 kindergarten-aged children, all dressed in matching khaki jackets and blue and white scarves. .Chouirfa, who was born in Brussels, lives in Molenbeek, a vibrant multicultural, inner-city neighbourhood home to a sizeable Moroccan-origin population. He’s still nursing heartbreak after Portugal knocked Morocco out of Russia’s 2018 World Cup during the tournament’s group stage. “[Cristiano] Ronaldo is my favourite player and he destroyed Morocco,” he said. .Although Belgium is the country he knows best, Chouirfa said he’ll support Morocco because that is where his parents are from and it is this heritage that he feels more connected to, especially when it comes to food, traditions and culture. But if the Atlas Lions, 22 in the FIFA rankings, lose their matches, he will support the Red Devils, ranked second. .A short stroll away, teenagers were setting off little firecrackers near an “agora”, one of the small outdoor, fenced football pitches found around the city. .Sumaya Riane, a slight 23-year-old with braces and a teal-coloured headscarf, walked by carrying a bag of chocolates and flowers with three girlfriends after a brunch to celebrate her upcoming marriage. .She was excited about the looming match between the two nations that are most important to her. Like Chouirfa, she was born in Belgium but plans to support her country of origin. “If Belgium wins I won’t be completely gutted,” she said, as her friends joked about preferring certain of the teams’ players for their looks over how they play. .Mohamed, who only wanted to give his first name, was in the agora shooting penalties with some teenagers from the neighbourhood. He hopes both teams will progress, adding that it’s the last chance for Belgium’s golden generation with players like De Bruyne, Eden Hazard – the Belgian captain, and Romelu Lukaku, to make football history. The team have yet to claim silverware, having been knocked out by France in the 2018 semi-finals, and by Argentina in the 2014 quarter-finals. .“It would be a shame if they don’t win it,” said the 25-year-old secondary school maths teacher. “It would be great to see Kevin De Bruyne get the cup.” .Fatima Zibouh is a civil society activist whose work and sociological research focus on inclusion and tackling discrimination against minorities. She was born, raised and lives in Molenbeek, where she is the president of a youth centre. .She described the Moroccan diaspora in Belgium as diverse. “It’s not homogeneous, it’s not monolithic,” Zibouh explained. .The diaspora has been shaped by different stages of migration. A 1964 bilateral labour agreement between the two governments led to the first big wave of mostly young men who came from northern Morocco to work in Belgium’s coal mines and later its steel and car sectors, then the country’s primary industries, according to Nadia Fadil, an associate professor in anthropology at KU Leuven who researches North African diasporas in Western Europe. .Across 10 years, about 25,000 Moroccans arrived, until labour migration was halted in 1974. After that, Moroccan students could come to Belgium on visas linked to study while wives and children were able to join the men on the grounds of family unification. Not much is known about the Moroccan communities from the period until 1974, Fadil said, although cultural contributions like mosques had already started to appear. .With the arrival of families, Moroccan migrant communities took root wherever there was work, said Fadil. Families established themselves in cities like Liege in the south where there were coalmines, in Brussels, around the canal in neighbourhoods like Molenbeek where there were smaller industries, and in the northern Flemish-speaking port city of Antwerp. .In 2008 and 2009, younger but also older migrant Moroccan workers, many of them undocumented, came to Belgium from Spain and Italy – along with many nationals from those countries – which were harder hit by the financial crisis. Moroccans had previously followed work opportunities in those countries in sectors like agriculture. In Belgium, they entered the agriculture, hospitality, cleaning and construction industries. .More recent arrivals often face precarity, including living below the poverty threshold and being undocumented, according to Fadil. In 2021, undocumented migrant workers, many of whom are Moroccan, went on a hunger strike to demand the right to live and work in Belgium. .Today, the diaspora represents a range of socioeconomic backgrounds – from business owners to lawyers, teachers and undocumented workers – but the majority are working-class, she explained. .Zibouh offers the term “Belgo-Moroccan” to describe people of Moroccan origin in Belgium. This has nothing to do with your passport, she said: “It’s a feeling of belonging,” and is marked by degrees of belonging to both identities. .Choosing a football team comes down to where one feels a greater sense of belonging, the 41-year-old suggested, and this differs even between two people who share the same background. .Zibouh, herself a third-generation Belgian citizen of Moroccan origin, polled her family over WhatsApp about who they will support. “One [sister] said Morocco, the other one said Belgium. My father said both,” she said. His words were: “C’est kifkif,” French, then Maghrebi Arabic for, “It’s the same.” .An avid football fan, she plans to watch the match with her family. “It’s a party for us,” she said, showing pictures on her phone of boisterous family gatherings during the last World Cup. In one she wears a garland in the colours of the Belgian flag while celebrating a Red Devils victory in the city centre. .Although picking a side is difficult, “I have more connection with Belgium,” Zibouh concluded. If Belgium is knocked out, she echoes what her sister told her: “We have the privilege to be happy if Belgium wins [or] if Morocco wins.” .In the 2018 World Cup, two players of Moroccan origin led Belgium to a decisive victory in a nail-biting match against Japan to advance to the quarter-finals. .In this tournament, Belgium has no players of Moroccan heritage in its squad. Morocco has several players born in Belgium. Eighteen-year-old Bilal el Khannouss, born in a Brussels suburb and a native of the Belgian capital, plays for the football club KRC Genk under-18 division in the country’s northern region of Flanders. He was asked to play for the Belgian national team but has said he chose Morocco as he wanted to make his “grandparents proud“. .When it comes to fans picking a national team, how people self-identify is key, according to Fadil. .“I know quite a lot of people who also in their identification, the way they see themselves, would use the term ‘Belgian Moroccan’ or even just Moroccan even if they’re a second or third generation,” she said. .“If they say I’ll support both, it’s an expression of the dual identities,” Fadil added. .Identity, she suggested, is also more fluid in a country like Belgium, composed of the French-speaking south and the Flemish-speaking north, and where national unity is something “exceptional”. .“People put all kinds of things in Belgianness,” Fadil explained. .“I think Belgium, in difference to France, is not a thick nation-state. It’s a very thin nation-state, which also allows people to have these kinds of hyphenated identities.” .Back on the football pitch, Abdelouhad, the municipality worker, said he just hopes that the day of the match will go smoothly. .In 2017, when Morocco beat Ivory Coast 2-0 in a World Cup qualifying match, street celebrations in Brussels turned into riots in which shops were looted and windows smashed. .He worries about any trouble that could stigmatise people of Moroccan background. .Discrimination against people of Moroccan heritage persists in areas such as employment and housing. .A study published in 2021, for example, found that potential tenants with Moroccan-sounding names were 28 percent less likely to be called back to visit a property. .Belgian government socioeconomic monitoring statistics from 2019 that Zibouh cited indicate that while the labour market situation has improved for people of Maghrebi origin, their chances of finding a job remain lower than the national average. .“Moroccans have become this kind of, you could say, go-to kind of figure when it comes to racism and othering,” Fadil explained. .She said this stigmatisation and stereotypes of urban delinquency go back to migration and multiculturalism debates from the 1980s and 1990s where rhetoric revolved around immigrant communities as not deserving of social welfare. .“I really hope that there won’t be any problems,” Abdelouhad said, turning to head an orange football back to a boy in a grey hoodie. “Football is about having fun, getting along, understanding each other.” .His favourite player in the Moroccan national team is Netherlands-born Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech, who overcame difficult teenage years after the loss of his father when he was 10 years old to become a top footballer. Ziyech’s story has a message for others, believes Abdelouhad. “You never let go,” he explained, as he headed off to his weekly Sunday football match with friends. .Across the city and over the canal in Molenbeek, it was early evening as people walked down a busy street packed with grocery, fashion and pastry shops. .Aya Hami, 19, a student who juggles studying with working in a restaurant, a retirement home and as a boxing coach, walked by wearing big headphones. When asked which team she will support, she sighed. It’s a tough decision between her country of origin and her birthplace. “It’s hard to choose,” she said, before deciding she will support lower-ranked Morocco which she thinks has a promising lineup. “They are kind of the underdog.” .Inside Le Fair Play Molenbeekois, a sport café on a street corner, men were sitting at tables drinking tea and coffee. A television screen aired a Premier League match between Manchester United and Fulham and pictures of local football players decorated the walls. .Mohamed Akkouh, 36, a Moroccan living and working in Brussels, who was dressed in a red hoodie and drinking a coffee, planned to watch the Belgium vs Morocco game at the café. For him, there was no “clear-cut choice” about who to support. Instead, Akkouh, who plays football with friends and does kickboxing, said he is interested in how the teams play and strategise. “The team that plays the best I’m going to go for,” he said. “I’m going to enjoy the game as it is.” .Ben Ali Abdelmalik, 54, a heavy vehicle driver who came to Belgium in 1991, sat with three friends at an adjacent table. “Belgium and Morocco are the same thing,” he said. “Morocco is the mother, Belgium is the wife. You can’t choose.” .They will be on the streets celebrating whoever wins, he said. “If we draw we win everything. It’s perfect. It’s a win-win situation.” .Zibouh also hopes for a draw. “A lot of people say: How can I choose between my father and my mother?”",366
367,Published On 27 Nov 2022,What Messi means to Argentina and the World Cup,"He turned up, he led, he scored. Argentina survived and stayed in the World Cup.",".Doha, Qatar – It wasn’t the way Lionel Messi scored but the way he seized the moment and made it his own in front of 88,000 people. .Lusail Stadium needs to be a no-fly zone when Argentina play there with Messi in the ranks. .The passengers on any airplanes above the stadium when Messi scored would’ve felt the turbulence caused not by the dirty air but the peacefulness of a late November evening destroyed with utter disdain by Argentina fans celebrating a Messi goal in a must-win match. .The crowd had been loud all evening. But perhaps the fine margin between Argentina’s survival and elimination kept the sound levels in check somewhat. Or maybe they were saving their voices for Messi’s goal, certain that the maestro would deliver when it mattered and that it would all go according to plan. .Two days ago, I compared low-flying F16s to 60,000 celebrating Brazilian fans and how the latter would arguably win in a contest to gauge the loudest. .On Saturday night, I was proven wrong. .Messi scored, and the stadium erupted. If sound waves could turn into flames, pour scorn on everything around them – that by now was little bits of nothing – and leave them to burn before taking over the space left behind, that was the moment. .In Brazil eight years ago, that 7-1 was in a semi-final. This year, Argentina had been clinging on. The loss to Saudi Arabia not only rattled them but left them humiliated – and facing an early World Cup exit. In a group match. .But Messi scored. And now Argentina were dreaming again: On the pitch, in the crowd, in Buenos Aires many thousands of kilometres away and in Rosario a couple of hours up the road where this little boy still lives in murals and memories of residents. .“How do you want me to answer that?” said an Argentina fan after the game when asked to describe if he was relieved the team survived or impressed by Messi. .“It’s Messi. It’s football. Football was made so that Messi could come and honour it. It’s Messi. I don’t think I can say much more. You saw what he did.” .And it was not just the Argentinians who were left in awe. A young Mexico supporter, draped in the greens of her team, interrupted her father who had just said that “Messi’s performance wasn’t enjoyable”. .“Yes it was!” she exclaimed, then calmed. “I got to see a Messi goal. I’m a Mexican supporter and I got to see a Messi goal in real life and not on TV. It was nice to see Messi score.” .“Now we’re supporting Argentina and Messi to beat Poland and help us reach the knockouts,” chuckled her father. .For Cristina, an Argentina match and being able to watch Messi live in action was a dream come true. A Messi goal, given what was at stake, was extra icing with a cherry on top, to cherish for eternity. .“I landed in Qatar yesterday [from the Philippines],” she said. I’ve always been a huge Messi fan. And oh my gosh, I was so nervous given that if they lost, they would’ve been eliminated. Not the result I would’ve wanted. But then I got what I came here for: a Messi goal! .“My life is complete,” she added, glancing towards her cousin Det who admitted she was not a football fan but had come to witness the culmination of long years of construction work she had witnessed during her six years in Qatar. .“Qatar is not a now-or-never World Cup for Messi, it’s a postscript for a movie that was supposed to have ended in Russia,” Shubi Arun wrote on Al Jazeera earlier this month. .Diego Maradona is no more. For Argentina, and football, it’s Messi carrying the flame. .For him, it’s now or never as he’s likely playing in his last World Cup. .Before the match, Saudi and Mexican fans continued taking jabs at Messi, looking around and “checking” each other’s pockets outside the stadium and exclaiming: “Where is Messi? Where is Messi?” .The goal against Mexico will not make it into the top 10 goals of the tournament. But it will surely be one of the talking points. Because it was Messi, he scored and Argentina survived.",367
368,Published On 27 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Germany vs Spain match preview,Two of Europe’s top teams battle it out in Group E.,".It’s a must-watch meeting of two footballing giants. .Spain, absolutely flying from their remarkable 7-0 demolition of Costa Rica on Wednesday meet Germany who are still smarting from their defeat at the hands of Japan on the same day. .A new generation of Spanish youngsters directed by veteran midfield general Sergio Busquets, will star again delivering pin-point passes across the pitch. .The speed of 18-year-old Barcelona star Gavi matched with Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres out wide is just one devastating weapon in Luis Enrique’s armoury for this game. .Enrique also has a star-studded case in Yeremy Pino, Ansu Fati and Nico Williams and the more experienced Rodri, Marcos Llorente and Alvaro Morata to keep Spain buzzing. Together, they bring youth and experience to play. .Spain have lifted the World Cup once, and are among the favourites to do so again this year. .But while they are in truly imperious form, their opponents are desperate to put their defeat to Japan behind them and retake their place in world football. .The current German squad has Thomas Muller and Ilkay Gundogan who at aged 33 and 32 respectively, are veterans in this team. Its spine, meanwhile, is the Bayern Munich contingent who make up half the team, some of whom achieved Bundesliga and European glory with Hansi Flick before his appointment to lead the national team. .Bayern’s own wunderkind, 19-year-old Jamal Musiala, is expected to shine soon at this tournament. A former England youth international, Stuttgart-born Musiala can play on either wing and across midfield. Watch out for him popping up everywhere. .Apart from taking half the Munich team to Qatar, Flick has also brought Borussia Mönchengladbach’s mercurial midfielder Jonas Hofmann, whose versatility is key to Die Mannschaft’s plans for a reversal of fortunes. Behind them is Manuel Neuer, one of the world’s best goalkeepers – and in front of them is the talented Kai Havertz. .Having won the World Cup four times, the Germans are seeking a fifth star on their shirts. But they will need to roll back the disappointments at the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020 to retake their place among the world’s greats. .Will that be enough against a Spanish team that just seems to score for fun?",368
369,Published On 27 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Croatia vs Canada match preview,Croatia and Canada look to get their World Cup campaigns started after frustrating results in their opening games.,".Who: Croatia vs Canada, Group F .Where: Khalifa International Stadium, Doha .When: November 27 at 7pm (16:00 GMT) .Croatia and Canada will both feel they should have won their opening fixture. .The 2018 finalists were held to a frustrating nil-nil draw against Morocco as they struggled to find the cutting edge in a game where chances were at a premium. .Canada’s opening match, their first in a World Cup since 1986, proved to be more entertaining. The Maple Leafs’ performance belied their experience on this stage as their high press and sharp movement suffocated Belgium. The Belgians conceded a penalty in only the 10th minute of the game, but Canadian star Alphonso Davies had his attempt saved by Thibaut Courtois. .Canada’s verve didn’t wane. Despite having Belgium on the back foot for a majority of the first half, they conceded late in the first half. Their intensity fell off in the second half, and Belgium held on for a 1-0 win. . .Canada manager John Herdman pulled the players into a huddle on the pitch after the final whistle, where he lauded their performance and, in rather colourful language, told them they’d defeat Croatia. .While Herdman’s rallying cry came in the heat of the moment, it isn’t a far-fetched prospect. While Mateo Kovacic, Luka Modric and Marcelo Brozovic are all excellent midfield technicians, they may struggle against a team as pacy as Canada. The Maple Leafs overran the Belgian midfield to such an extent in the first half that manager Roberto Martinez was forced to bring on two defensive midfielders at half-time. .Unsurprisingly, Modric still holds the key for Croatia. Against, Morocco, he dictated play and was judged man of the match for his performance. But the bluntness of his team’s strike force remains an issue: In their past eight games, Croatia have managed just 10 goals. .And while Canada’s fledgling group of youngsters is beginning to take flight, Croatia’s golden generation has begun its descent after spending the past few years flying high. .Will Croatia’s experience and wiliness be enough to overcome plucky Canada?",369

The age of players such as Real Madrid’s Eden Hazard is beginning to show on the pitch during action for club and country. .This game could present a well-drilled, passionate Moroccan team with a real opportunity to beat an increasingly inconsistent Belgian side. .The Atlas Lions’ first match against Croatia was a cagey affair that ended in a nil-nil draw. However, there were flashes of brilliance from Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech and PSG’s Achraf Hakimi. The latter is a doubt for Sunday’s match after picking up a thigh injury against Croatia. .A number of players on the Moroccan squad were born in Belgium, including Selim Amallah, who is likely to start on the left wing. .Romelu Lukaku is expected to start on the bench for Belgium after recovering from a thigh injury that has limited his appearances for Inter Milan this season.

It was the joint biggest loss in their history and their worst in the World Cup. A defeat had been expected but not a drubbing of this nature. .These opening fixtures completely changed the complexion of this tie. Japan will enter the game knowing that a win will secure qualification to the next round while Costa Rica are playing to win back pride. .In the past few World Cups, Japan have been the “almost team”. In 2018, they got out of a tricky group featuring Senegal, Poland, and Colombia and fell 3-2 to Belgium in a Round of 16 game that they had been leading 2-0. In 2010, they reached the Round of 16 before agonisingly going out on penalties to Paraguay. .While their defeat of Germany sent shockwaves across the country, it’s worth noting that this Japan side has defeated USA, Ghana, Australia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia in this calendar year. . .Costa Rica have taken the adage “don’t fix what isn’t broken” far too seriously. Six of the players who were part of the 2014 World Cup squad that reached the quarterfinal are in Qatar. Five of them started against Spain. None of them is under the age of 30 and that may be showing on the pitch. .Keylor Navas, one of the best goalkeepers in the world at one point, looked hapless against Spain and could do nothing to stop the onslaught. Navas and the rest of the Costa Rican team will have to dig deep against Japan to avoid suffering the same fate. .Form and history don’t seem to be on Costa Rica’s side; the two sides have met twice before, with Japan winning both times.",371

Canada head coach John Herdman described his squad as “light, bright and clear, ready to go” into what effectively is a ‘must-win’ game for the Canucks. .They currently lie at the bottom of the standings after the narrow 1-0 defeat to Belgium in their opening fixture on Wednesday. .The game will also mark Canada skipper Atiba Hutchinson’s 100th appearance for his country. .Croatia drew their opener against Morocco 0-0, and Croatia head coach Zlatko Dalia has called on his team to adopt a more aggressive attitude, be more energetic and raise the tempo when they face Canada on Sunday. .Following their tame goalless draw with Morocco on Wednesday, Croatia were criticised for their lacklustre performance, but Dalia said on Saturday that he is confident the ‘real face’ of the team will come to the fore against the Canadians. .“We are Croatia, let’s face it,” Dalia said. “If we just play our game, we will have a positive performance, a positive outcome.” .Germany and Spain were in training on Saturday ahead of their Sunday showdown, with the Germans facing a second consecutive World Cup first-round exit should they lose to the Spanish. .Since Germany’s shock 2-1 defeat to Japan on Wednesday, coach Hansi Flick has been working overtime to pick his players up off the floor after the opener loss. .Flick’s team have now won just two of their last nine internationals across all competitions and they will now seek to avoid losing successive group-stage games at a World Cup tournament for the first time. .But they are up against a powerful Spanish side playing with real freedom, as exemplified by Spain’s 7-0 hammering of Costa Rica. .Flick had nothing but praise for Spain coach Luis Enrique on Saturday. .“I really like talking to him. He’s set up this new young team with young players with a fantastic quality,” he said. .For his part, Enrique, who on Saturday described Germany as the team that was the most similar to Spain, said he expected an open contest between the two European rivals. .  .Should Japan avoid defeat against Costa Rica in the earlier kickoff on Sunday, Germany must beat Spain if they wish to avoid back-to-back group-stage eliminations at the World Cup.",372
373,Published On 27 Nov 2022,"World Cup recap, Day 7: France through, Argentina survive","France beat Denmark, Argentina defeat Mexico, Poland win over Saudi Arabia, and an Australian victory over Tunisia.",".On day seven of the World Cup in Qatar, France has become the first country to earn their spot in the knockout stages after beating Denmark 2-1 on Saturday in a game that saw Kylian Mbappe put two goals away for the French. .With their victory over Denmark, world champions France now have six points at the top of Group D and are the first team to be guaranteed a place in the Round of 16. .Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Enzo Fernandez earned Argentina a 2-0 win over Mexico and kept their World Cup dreams alive, while the Mexicans must now beat Saudi Arabia to have any chance of entering the Round of 16. .It was also 2-0 for Poland in their tense match against Saudi Arabia, which saw the Saudis dominate the game for long periods, but the gritty Poles held the backline, and excellent goalkeeping saved them the day. .Australia earned their first World Cup victory in 12 years in a 1-0 win over Tunisia. The Tunisians are still hoping to advance from their group stage but must now beat France to achieve that goal. .Here is a quick guide recapping all you need to know from day seven — Saturday, November 26, 2022 — of the Qatar World Cup 2022. .  .France vs Denmark .France’s Kylian Mbappe scored two goals and put the defending champions into the knockout stage of the World Cup with their 2-1 win over Denmark in a game that early on seemed as if it could end in a deadlock. .Les Bleus attacked with might from the kickoff, and Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel just about tipped a dangerous header from Adrien Rabiot. Denmark also had their first chance with Andreas Cornelius shooting wide right. .It was France who finally broke through with fine attacking when Paris Saint-Germain star Mbappe gave his team the lead in the 61st minute. The French forward swapped passes with Theo Hernandez down the left flank and poked the ball past Schmeichel for the first goal. .But that was quickly cancelled out by Denmark’s Andreas Christensen, who scored an equaliser just seven minutes later. .Not to be outdone, Mbappe then scored the winner in the 86th when he jumped acrobatically to guide in the second after a cross from Antoine Griezmann to make Les Bleus the first team to advance to the round of 16. .Mbappe scored four goals when France won the World Cup four years ago, including one in the final. He now has 31 goals for France, moving him one ahead of Just Fontaine — the all-time leading scorer at a single World Cup with 13 goals at the 1958 tournament. .“I’m very happy with the way my players have responded,” France Coach Didier Deschamps told broadcasters TF1. “We are sure to be qualified after two games. It brings peace of mind,” he said. .“We have a strong and solid group of players who want to do great things.” .Denmark defender Victor Nelsson said after the match: “Right now I’m very disappointed with the late goal. It is unacceptable to let in a goal so late in the game … We need to win over Australia on Wednesday.” .Argentina vs Mexico .Argentina were aware that another defeat would have sent them out of the tournament on Saturday, and they started poorly against Mexico as they struggled to cope with the pressure the Mexicans unleashed from the first kick of the ball. .That struggle continued at Lusail Stadium until Lionel Messi found the bottom-right corner of the Mexican net from more than 20 metres (66 feet) out in the 64th minute, firing a low shot through a crowd of defenders into the back of the goal. .Messi was almost in tears as he grabbed and shook his jersey in front of Argentina’s celebrating fans, then blew a kiss and looked to the sky. It will go down as one of the most important goals of his career as it has reignited his team’s World Cup chances. .Argentinian fans inside the 89,000-seat Lusail Stadium hugged each other. Some cried. Argentina defender Lisandro Martinez fell to the ground and appeared to bury his face in the turf. .Argentina’s substitute Enzo Fernandez then added a second goal in the 87th minute, ensuring the team has bounced back from their 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia that now ranks as one of the World Cup’s biggest-ever upsets. .Fernandez — who is 21 years of age — also became the youngest player to score at a World Cup for Argentina since Messi himself in 2006. .“It’s a weight off our shoulders,” Messi said after the match. “It gives us joy and peace of mind to start again.” .“We lived with discomfort and kept the defeat in the opening match in our minds,” Messi said. “We were eager to have the chance to turn the situation around and luckily we won,” he said. .“All of our matches are finals now. We can’t mess up.” .Poland vs Saudi Arabia .It looked like Saturday’s Group C match was not going to go Poland’s way, with Saudi Arabia riding on a wave of confidence after their historic defeat of Argentina earlier this week. .Poland were playing before a deafening, overwhelmingly Saudi crowd that was excited, rapturous and raucous, booing and jeering nearly every Polish move. .In a first half dominated by slick Saudi counterattacking and large amounts of gamesmanship from the Gulf side, Poland received three yellow cards in the space of four minutes and were on the wrong end of a VAR penalty decision the Poles will deem harsh. .But it was Piotr Zielinski who opened the scoring for Poland in the 39th minute with a smart finish against the run of play. .Salem Aldawsari had a chance to bring Saudi Arabia back on level terms towards the end of the half, but his penalty kick was superbly saved by Wojciech Szczesny. The Polish keeper then saved a follow-up by Mohammed Alburayk, too. .With just eight minutes left in the game, Polish striker Robert Lewandowski dispossessed Abdulelah Almalki of the ball and slotted home the second of Poland’s 2-0 win. .Saturday’s win mattered. Poland needed at least a draw to stand any real chance of getting to the last 16 for the first time since 1986, and with Argentina left to play, few would fancy their chances. .“I think the older I get, the more emotional I get, and I’m aware that when it comes to the World Cup, it might be my last World Cup actually,” Lewandowski said after the game and what was his 77th international goal. .“The result of the team was most important … There’s another day and we need to get ready for the next match because we don’t know what’s going to happen next. We need to do all we can.” .Saudi Arabia coach Hervé Renard said he was proud of his team’s performance; Saudi Arabia had twice as many shots at goal as Poland did. .“I don’t think a lot of people [thought] Saudi Arabia was able to play this kind of football,” he said. “This is the reason why I’m proud of them,” he said after the match. .Renard referred to the vocal support the Green Falcons received at Education City Stadium, where the enthusiastic Saudi fans turned the game into a home one, and he hopes for more of the same for the final group game against Mexico on November 30 back at Lusail, where his team beat Argentina. .“I hope they won’t give up,” Renard said of the Saudi fans. .“Because when you are fans, you need to support your team when it’s a fantastic day, but you also need to support your team to make the history during the third game.” .Tunisia vs Australia .It was a scrappy start to the match between Tunisia and Australia until the “Socceroos” went ahead when striker Mitchell Duke scored midway through the first half with a glancing header past keeper Aymen Dahmen to give Australia the lead. .Duke’s goal came after he collected a goalkeeper’s pass near the middle of the field and made a quick touch to set Craig Goodwin down the left flank. Duke then sprinted forward to nod Goodwin’s deflected cross into the far corner with his back to the goal. .Duke celebrated scoring Australia’s winning goal by forming a “J” with his fingers in a tribute to his son Jaxson, who was in the stands. .The score quieted the large contingent of Tunisia fans among the crowd of 41,823 inside Al Janoub Stadium and sent the small pockets of Australian supporters dressed in yellow into delirium. .Tunisia had impressed when they held European Championship semi-finalist Denmark to a 0-0 draw in their opener, but only occasionally threatened against Australia until the Aussies sat back and defended towards the end. .Tunisia’s best chance came when skipper Youssef Msakni shot just wide. .It was an emotion-filled day for Australia, whose 1-0 victory over Tunisia was only their third win in 18 World Cup matches. .Tunisia is still seeking to advance from the group stage for the first time in its six World Cup appearances but now needs to beat France. .“This edition of the World Cup has had surprises for everyone. The larger squads have been defeated,” Tunisia coach Jalel Kadri said. .“We still have one more match to go and we’ll play our hearts out.” .",373

Fernandez followed it up in the 87th minute with a wonderful curling effort to secure the win. .The victory took Argentina up to second place on three points, one point behind leaders Poland, who they will play in their last group match.",374

More than 5,000 Argentina fans already live in Qatar. .Enzo Fernandez sealed the victory in the 87th minute with a wonderful arcing strike. From an Argentinian corner won on the left side, Fernandez was able to slalom himself towards the corner of the penalty box before unleashing a strike of some quality that curled into the top right of the goal. .In doing so, Fernandez became the youngest player to score at a World Cup for Argentina since Messi himself in 2006. .“Today starts another World Cup for Argentina,” Messi said after the final whistle. “I tell people the same thing, that they continue to believe. .“The first half we didn’t play as we should and in the second, when we calmed down, we started to play the ball better.” .Mexico, who have now lost all four of their World Cup clashes with Argentina, have one point and must beat Saudi Arabia, who have three points, to have any chance of making the Round of 16, as they have in the past seven World Cups. .With the prospect of an Argentina elimination ahead of this game, tensions were high on and off the ball in a scrappy first half, with the two sets of fans creating an electric atmosphere inside and outside the stadium. .The opening period did not live up to the match’s billing, with neither team wanting to commit too many players forward, and, save for a free kick by Mexico’s Luis Chavez in the ninth minute that sailed past the goalmouth, there were few chances. .Mexico’s high-pressing game stifled most of their opponents’ attack and Argentinian talisman Messi struggled to find any space to manoeuvre in a congested midfield. .But in a serious blow to Mexico, skipper Andres Guardado, a veteran of five World Cups who until then had been a commanding presence in midfield, was taken off injured in the 42nd minute. .The Mexicans still carved out two more chances before the break with Alexis Vega first curling a free kick over the wall for keeper Emiliano Martinez to save and, minutes later, thundering a shot over the bar. .The South Americans looked more determined after the break but had no real chance before their 35-year-old captain dragged them out of trouble with his second goal of the tournament, reviving his chances of winning a first-ever World Cup title.",375

Albanian-majority Kosovo claimed independence from Serbia in 2008 and is now a FIFA member, but Serbia does not recognise its sovereignty. .“The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has opened proceedings against the Football Association of Serbia due to a flag displayed in their dressing room on the occasion of the Brazil v Serbia,” FIFA said in a statement on Saturday. .“The proceedings were opened on the basis of Article 11 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and Article 4 of the Regulations for the FIFA World Cup 2022.” .The Kosovo Football Federation (FKK) said it “strongly condemns Serbia’s aggressive actions” against Kosovo. .“The World Cup is an event of joy and unity, it should send messages of hope and peace, not messages of hate,” the FFK said in a tweet. “We call on FIFA to take measures against such actions.” .The flag with the inscription “We do not surrender” was also displayed by several Serbia fans in the stadium during the opening 2-0 World Cup defeat against Brazil in Qatar on Thursday. .The image of the flag went viral on social media when it was shared by Hajrulla Ceku, Kosovo’s Minister of Culture, Youth and Sport. .“Disgraceful images from Serbia locker room, displaying hateful, xenophobic and genocidal messages towards Kosova, while exploiting FIFA World Cup platform,” Ceku said on Twitter, referring to the country by its Albanian name. .“We expect concrete actions from FIFA considering that the Kosovo Football Federation is a full FIFA and UEFA member.” . .No player can be seen in the photograph of the flag in the dressing room, which was hanging above the jerseys and lockers of defender Milos Veljkovic and midfielder Andrija Zivkovic. .Veljkovic plays for Werder Bremen, and a spokesperson for the Bundesliga club told the Deichstube website that the player only found out about the photo after the match. .When the Serbia players returned to the dressing room, there was no flag hanging there, the spokesperson added. .Serbia, who lost 2-0 to Brazil, next play Cameroon on Monday.

But here, we would like to promote who Mexicans are. We want to be ambassadors.” .Abel Costa, 61, told Al Jazeera that progressing out of the group stages would be a “huge win” for Mexico and provide a boost to a country facing difficult economic and security issues. .“People back home have so little … There is lots of poverty and violence. People are just trying to make it one day at a time,” said Costa, who travelled to Doha with several male members of his family. .“Football takes their minds off all the problems they have,” he said, adding that if Mexico wins a game in the tournament, “it will be a huge party in the street.” .On Saturday evening, Mexico faced Argentina, a team it has never beaten in a World Cup tournament.

The Polish keeper, who was arguably Poland’s best player in the game, superbly saved the follow-up by Mohammed Alburayk, too. .A late Robert Lewandowski goal, his first in a World Cup, added gloss to a hard-fought Poland win. .“You have to be efficient, but we weren’t,” said Saudi Arabia coach Herve Renard after the game. “But I am very proud of my players. We are not finished yet.” .After two matches, Poland have four points and Saudi Arabia have three. Mexico and Argentina, who face off later on Saturday, have one and zero points, respectively, after one match. .Riding on the confidence of their win over Argentina and cheered on by a sellout Education City Stadium crowd, predominantly in green, Saudi Arabia dominated the game for large periods of the game. But, a resolute Poland backline and an inspired goalkeeping performance kept them at bay. .The inflection point of the game was Szczesny’s penalty save. Saudi Arabia deserved a goal for their efforts in the first half where they had Poland on the ropes. But the Juventus keeper’s double-save knocked some of the air out of them. .Still, the Green Falcons continued to be dangerous as the game progressed and it took another sensational save from Szczesny with his legs to deny Aldawsari in the 55th minute. .Poland then was able to feed off the tension festering in the stands and the frustration in the Saudi players and began to wrest back control of the game. .While Saudi Arabia’s performance featured many elements from their victory against Argentina – the high line, the energy in midfield, the pace on the wings – they were vulnerable in transition as Poland hit the woodwork twice, first with Arkadiusz Milik’s diving header and then a close range shot by Lewandowski. .The Barcelona forward, arguably one of the best in the world, found the net in the 82nd minute when he pounced on a mistake by Abdulellah Almalki and found himself in a simple one-on-one situation that he comfortably finished. .Lewandowski had tears in his eyes as he celebrated scoring his first World Cup goal.

I want people to come for the Word Cup and leave with our culture,” Naimi said. .For many customers, including Jouad from Morocco, this is their first dip into wearing a ghutra. “I never tried … this is the first time I have tried it and I have lived in Qatar for 10 years,” he says. .“When you see the Moroccan team and people here you feel proud, especially on Arabic land here for the first time. I feel like I am home, in the capital of Morocco” .Ashraf, a resident of Singapore and the proud owner of a ghutra in the Brazilian colours, says it’s not really the full World Cup experience unless you get the scarf. “[It’s] just like if you go to Brazil, you wear all the nice Rio Carnival stuff … it amplifies the culture,” he said. .Tunisian fan Belgacem agreed, trying on a ghutra as his wife took photos. .“I am buying it [the ghutra] as a souvenir,”  he said. “When I go back to my country, I will remember this marvellous event and I will celebrate my presence here.” .With the tournament in full swing, Naimi is proud of his task and beaming with pride, even if he is missing live games during the tournament. .“It means the world to host this tournament in Qatar,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is the time we show the world how we shine. Qatar may be small in size, but it is big in acts, and hopefully, this tournament shows that.”",384

Quickly, it turned into an all-Middle Eastern party. .At the heart of it all was Doha’s Souq Waqif, where fans from different countries had gathered in a large group with their respective flags, joining in the singing and dancing. Chief among them were Qataris, who were happy to play second fiddle at their neighbours’ party after the hosts’ national team lost to Ecuador in the tournament’s opener. .“We are not sad that Qatar lost, we are happy that Saudi Arabia won,” said Bassam Muhammad, a Qatari student, as others walked by waving the flags of both countries, which restored full relations in early 2021 after a years-long diplomatic rift. .Just hours after the Saudi win on Tuesday, Tunisia pulled its own weight to hold the higher-ranked Denmark to a surprise 0-0 draw at the Education City Stadium. .Most of the more than 40,000 or so fans in attendance were rooting for the team from North Africa. .Amine, a Tunisian fan, thinks that the Arab unity on display among the supporters is not strange to see. .“Politics is different and people are different,” he said. “People are always united, even when leaders aren’t.” .Amine said he is a regular at Souq Waqif, where fans from Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia congregate in the evenings to have one big party. .“Even Egyptians, Algerians, Lebanese and Omani fans are here, even though their teams didn’t even qualify for the tournament. But nobody cares.” .On the morning of Morocco’s first match of the tournament against Croatia, Doha’s central metro train station turned red as fans of the Atlas Lions set off for the Al Bayt Stadium in al-Khor. .“This is the best Mundial (world cup), and we are happy that it is in Qatar,” Rachid, and his group of friends from Oujda, Morocco said ahead of the match. .Morocco, the highest-ranked Arab team at the tournament at 22, went on to hold 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia to a 0-0 draw in what was seen as a win by their fans. .On Saturday, Saudi Arabia play their second match in the tournament at Education City Stadium, squaring against Poland in a highly anticipated affair to determine whether the Green Falcons can build on their shock opening win. .It would certainly feel like playing at home. Saudi Arabia ranks third on the list of ticket-purchasing countries for the tournament, according to FIFA sales numbers. .Some optimistic Saudi fans, like al-Dabbagh who travelled from Riyadh, say they will consider staying longer in Qatar if their team progresses. .“This is just like my country, it feels no different,” he said of Qatar. “And if my team continues winning, who knows, I might just spend the whole month here.” .Tournament organisation rules do not allow non-ticket holders to enter Qatar during the group stage matches, but they will be allowed on certain terms once the knock-out stages begin. .But, Qataris, despite the disappointment from their team’s early exit, promise to continue supporting the Saudi team and the rest from the region. .“We are proud of all Arab teams and we will cheer for them as they go along in the tournament,” said Asma. .In addition to the support received by participating Arab teams, the Palestinian cause has also received vociferous backing during the tournament. .Amine, from Tunisia, said it is because all Muslims identify with the cause. .“Wherever you go [in Qatar], you will see a Palestinian flag because we want to remind the world that Palestinians are not alone,” he said, adding that Tunisians typically show solidarity with Palestine whenever their team play in a major tournament. .Asma, who attended Qatar’s match against Ecuador, said every member of her family carried and waved the Palestinian flag at the stadium because they feel it is their responsibility as Muslims to tell the world about Palestine. .“I hope we can bring attention towards Palestine, and I also believe that this World Cup will help change the Western world’s perception about this about the Arab world, and not just Qatar.”",385

When you come here you need to know where you’re coming from [as a country]. If this is a failure and disappointment, that depends on expectations,” Sanchez told reporters on Saturday. .“Our goal was to be competitive … We’ve been working for so many months to be able to give a good performance. But sometimes the match does not play out as you expect. It also depends on the opponents’ performance. We didn’t play at our top level. We were competitive but didn’t improve.” .With a final game against group favourites the Netherlands looming, Qatar are in danger of becoming the first World Cup hosts to fail to win a single game. .“We are aware of how tough this competition is. We wanted to go far but we know we had limitations as a country,” Sanchez added. .“It’s a small country, not a very large population. The local league is not a very competitive one. It’s our first time at the World Cup. If we can take part again, that would be great. It’s always useful to get more experience.” .When asked if the team had reached the end of a cycle, Sanchez disagreed but admitted there could be changes when they defend their Asian Cup crown next year. .“We have some young players and more experienced players … Our goal is very clear, we will have a generational shift. Some players will leave, others will come,” he said. .“We might have new players at the Asian Cup next year, some players cannot play at their best for such a long time, but it’s not the end of a cycle.” .Sanchez added that the early World Cup exit will not be fatal for the country’s football development. .“The World Cup will finish but football will continue here,” said the Spaniard, who led Qatar to the 2019 Asian Cup title. “It’s a football country and they want to keep developing young talent so they can reach the senior team. We can keep on competing within our limitations in Asia. .“By doing that, we’ll get more experience and we’ll be able to play in more competitions like this.”",387
388,Published On 26 Nov 2022,Nine of 11 Saudi starters play for same club. Who are Al Hilal?,The Riyadh-based club is the kingdom’s most successful football team.,".Doha, Qatar – As the announcer blared one after another the names of the Saudi players – to loud cheers inside Lusail stadium – a distinctive pattern emerged. .Of the 11 players lined up on Tuesday up to play against Argentina, nine were from Saudi champions Al Hilal – a rare occurrence for a modern-era football World Cup. .What’s more, two of the five substitutes that took to the pitch for the Green Falcons also play for the same club. .And crucially, Saleh al-Shehri and Salem al-Dawsari – the scorers of both Saudi Arabia’s goals in the historic upset against the Lionel Messi-led Argentina – are also Al Hilal players. .Founded in 1957, Riyadh-based Al Hilal are the kingdom’s – and Asia’s – most successful team, attracting big names from home and abroad. .In June, the team nicknamed the Blue Waves were crowned champions of the Saudi Pro League for an 18th time. .Their roster included Nigerian international and former Watford and Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo, who scored the two decisive goals in the last match of the season that helped them clinch the title. .Since the top Saudi league was established in 1976, Al Hilal are among only four teams to have participated in every season. .They have also won the Crown Prince Cup, the oldest domestic football competition in the kingdom, a record 13 times. .And last year, Al Hilal became the first club to win four Asia Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League titles. They have also scooped the Asia Cup Winners Cup and the Asian Super Cup twice. .In international football, players, busy with club commitments, hardly get time to train with their national team peers and develop a close understanding of each others’ movement on the pitch. .In the run-up to the World Cup, the first to be played at this time of the year, many players joined their national teams just a few days before the 32-team global tournament got under way on November 18. .Managers preparing for months had little time to put their final stamp on their teams or assess their players adequately. .But for the Saudis, it was a different story. .Eleven of the players that stepped onto the field against Argentina train with each other daily. And in a rather interesting twist, these footballers are all coached at Al Hilal by an Argentinian: Ramón Díaz, an experienced manager who has been in charge of several teams in his home country, as well as the national team of Paraguay. .Aside from having almost all their starting 11 from one team, the Saudi national team has a coach who has made a name for himself turning unfancied teams into killers of giants. .Frenchman Herve Renard, 54, burst onto the international scene in 2012 when he led Zambia to the Africa Cup of Nations title for the first time, beating in the final an Ivory Coast team that included English Premier League legends such as Didier Drogba and brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure. .Renard, a powerful motivator, then headed to Ivory Coast where he led them to the continental trophy before setting up camp in Rabat. He then guided Morocco to the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the first time in 20 years the North Africans qualified for the tournament. .Saudi Arabia are next in the World Cup action on Saturday against Poland, looking for a win that will get them to the next stage. And with a group of players who have trained together for so long and a coach who has mastered the art of overachieving, the Green Falcons can hope to be able to scale new heights.",388

A loss against Mexico, and Lionel Messi’s men will be booking an early flight home from Qatar. .Until Saudi Arabia blew this group wide open with their shock victory over La Albiceleste on Tuesday, Argentina’s form had been truly imperious – unbeaten in more than 30 games, and one of the favourites to lift the trophy at the Qatar World Cup. .If Argentina fail to regroup after the devastating upset, it will mean an ignominious exit and the sourest of notes on which end to Messi’s international career. .Argentina’s defence is (usually) rock solid, and it would be a surprise if Mexico manage to break through on goal. Likewise, as we saw in their 0-0 draw against Poland on Tuesday, Mexico’s defence is good, though certainly permeable. .And goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, appearing in his fifth World Cup, who saved a penalty from Poland’s Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski, will still be tough to beat. .Argentina have Messi, Angel di Maria, Julian Alvarez and Inter teammates Lautaro Martínez and Joaquin Correa all available in attack. .Mexican hopes will largely rest on the shoulders of striker Raul Jimenez, who has only started a handful of times for the Wolverhampton Wanderers this season. Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez has been left at home. .According to the FIFA rankings, Mexico (13th) are a far better team than Saudi Arabia (51st). They have played in eight consecutive World Cups and their fans in Qatar are among the loudest. But Argentina remain a top team, and they have their backs against the wall. Expect fireworks.",389

Where: Stadium 974
When: Saturday, November 26, 7pm (16:00 GMT)
Head to head: France (8), Denmark (6) and two draws .Denmark are somewhat of a good luck charm for France, who encountered them at the group stage in 1998 and 2018 – the last two victorious World Cup campaigns for Les Bleus. .Denmark had been labelled “dark horses” by many pundits for the tournament, having been on a recent fine run of form that included beating France twice in the nations league. .However, perceptions of the Scandinavians have changed after they were bullied by Tunisia in a chest-thumping, high-octane opening match. .The Eagles of Carthage played with an intensity that took the spark out of the “Danish Dynamite” who slowly grew into the game, with Andreas Cornelius missing a gilt-edged chance in the final minutes. .France rampant against Australia .Meanwhile, France enjoyed a fine start to their World Cup campaign swatting aside the Socceroos 4-1 courtesy of an Olivier Giroud brace. .There will be slight concerns that they allowed Australia, who lacked real quality in their team, to open the scoring. .Just before the tournament began, Karim Benzema had to withdraw after failing to recover from a thigh injury. Still, France boast an embarrassment of riches up front with Kylian Mbappe, Antione Greizmann and Giroud as starters. .Denmark’s Thomas Delaney had to come off just before half-time on Tuesday and is a doubt for the match. He has been a stalwart of the Danish midfield over the past years and also impressed atthe .club level for Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla. .The Danes will look to Christian Eriksen to orchestrate Danish play against a strong France team. He did show flashes of brilliance against Tunisia but will need to raise his game against superior opposition. .Besides Benzema, France are missing several key players, including Pogba and Kante, who were unable to travel to Qatar because of injury. However, they will feel confident that their replacements, Real Madrid’s duo of Aurélien Tchouaméni and Eduardo Camavinga as well as Juventus’ Adrien Rabiot, who scored against Australia, will be able to fill in the gap. .A win will see France secure a spot in the last 16. If Denmark win instead, they will fancy their chances of coming second in the group, as they will face an Australian side next that looked disjointed and lacking any real quality in their opening match.",390

It was also the first time that the Green Falcons won their opening match at the world’s biggest footballing spectacle. .The confidence-boosting win may provide the required boost for the team to extend their hot streak when they meet the Poles. But the team’s French coach Herve Renard has called on his players to remain focused on the task ahead. .“Our celebrations in the dressing room lasted only 20 minutes or less,” Renard told reporters after the match. .“We have two more games and we have to concentrate on those. The players have worked very hard and always maintained good team spirit, never complaining. Now they just need to keep their feet on the ground,” he added. .Ahead of them stands Poland and Barcelona’s goal-poacher Robert Lewandowski – the 2020 FIFA Men’s Player of the Year. .Team captain and talisman, Lewandowski missed a penalty in the team’s first match against Mexico which ended in a nil-nil draw. If the Red and White are to progress, Lewandowski, who has more than 600 career goals for club and country, needs to find his scoring touch again. .If they are to progress from the group, which also includes South American heavyweights Argentina, the Poles will need a positive result this time.",391

Australia beat the Carthage Eagles 3-0 in a 1997 friendly, but it was a reversal of fortunes for the latter at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup where they beat Australia 2-0. .After a goalless draw in their opening fixture against Denmark, semi-finalists at the last European Championships, Tunisia have secured their second clean sheet out of a total of 16 World Cup matches. .They are competing in the finals of the World Cup for the sixth time in their history, and they are looking to reach the knockout round of the competition for the first time. .Coach Jalel Kadri is likely to retain most of Tunisia’s starting XI against Denmark, as there are no new injury concerns. .Wahbi Khazri was a surprise omission for Tunisia in that game. But as the team’s leading goal scorer, the experienced attacker should return to the starting eleven against Australia. The 31-year-old will likely replace Anis Ben Slimane, joining Youssef Msakni and Issam Jebali in a show of more pronounced attacking ambition. . .Captain Msakni made his mark against Denmark, and is expected to be instrumental in the final third against Australia along with his strike partners. .And 19-year-old Manchester United midfielder Hannibal Mejbri will be hoping to play more minutes, after being brought on as a late substitute against Denmark. .Tunisia’s last and likely toughest game at the group stage will be against France next Wednesday, so their chances of qualifying for the knockout round could largely depend on their result against Australia. .In their opening game, the Socceroos were at the receiving end of a 4-1 drubbing by Les Blues, and if they lose again on Saturday, they will have crashed out of the World Cup at the group stages for a record third time after 1974 and 2014. .Australia, who have lost 11 of their 17 games at the World Cup and have failed to win in their last seven outings on this stage – their longest winless streak in the competition. .Still, coach Graham Arnold is not expected to make any radical changes to his team.

Its exit was confirmed a few hours later when Netherlands and Ecuador drew 1-1 in the other Group A game. .That left Qatar at the bottom of Group A with no chance of progressing. .South Africa had been the only other home team to fail to make it out of the group stage in 2010. .“If you expected us to go very far in this tournament, then it will be a disappointment,” Qatar coach Felix Sanchez said before his team was officially out. “Our goal was to be competitive.” .In other day-six fixtures, Iran scored a spectacular 2-0 win over Wales in stoppage time and the United States team frustrated England in a 0-0 draw for its second consecutive draw in the World Cup. .Here is a quick guide recapping all you need to know from Day 6 – Friday, November 25, 2022 – of the Qatar World Cup 2022. .With World Cup futures on the line, the footballing stakes could hardly have been higher for hosts Qatar and African champions Senegal. .Qatar’s opening-night nerves were nowhere to be seen as they quickly got to grips with Senegal and should have had a penalty when Senegal’s Ismaila Sarr bundled over Akram Afif, but Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz waved away their pleas and the VAR (video-assisted referee) did not intervene. .With Qatar defending well, it was going to take either a moment of magic or a catastrophic mistake for Senegal to break the deadlock. Unfortunately for Qatar defender Boualem Khoukhi, it turned out to be the latter. .His attempt to clear a routine low pass into the box by Senegal’s Krepin Diatta went disastrously wrong as he fluffed his clearance, allowing Boulaye Dia to pounce and rattle home the opening goal just before the break. .It got worse for Qatar early in the second half, with Famara Diedhiou doubling Senegal’s advantage with a brilliant glancing header from an Ismail Jakobs corner in the 48th minute. .It was a cue for the home team to play their best football of the tournament so far. .Mohammed Muntari reduced the deficit in the 78th minute with a first-ever goal for Qatar at a World Cup but Senegal were unruffled as they continued to out-muscle their opponents in midfield. .Six minutes after Muntari’s strike, Bamba Dieng swept home a pass from fellow substitute Iliman Ndiaye for the African side’s third goal of the match. .That consigned Qatar to the bottom of Group A with no points, while Netherlands and Ecuador have four points and the Senegalese three. .Qatar’s hopes of progressing are now over. .Even a win in their final game against three-time World Cup finalists Netherlands will not be enough to see them progress. .It was Enner Valencia’s third goal of the tournament that helped Ecuador earn a draw with the Dutch in Group A, thereby sealing Qatar’s fate. .Netherlands took the lead early on in the game with Cody Gakpo putting them ahead with a quick strike in the sixth minute. .But after that, Ecuador dominated. .After having the apparent equaliser overturned by VAR just before the half, Valencia leveled the match in the 49th minute. .Iran recovered from their thrashing by England with a superb 2-0 win over Wales, leaving their World Cup destiny in their own hands. .Iran’s Roozbeh Cheshmi broke the goalless deadlock in the 98th minute and Ramin Rezaeian scored in the 101st against a 10-man Welsh squad, which lost goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey to a red card in the 86th minute. .Hennessey initially drew a yellow card after his high challenge against Iran’s Mehdi Taremi but the referee showed him the red card after a VAR check. .With three points going into Tuesday’s game against the United States, Iran has a shot at advancing to the World Cup knockout stages for the first time. .Cheshmi said it was “the solidarity between the team members” that helped them win the game. .The outcome leaves Wales’s chances of reaching the last 16 hanging by a thread.

The team’s doctor said that talisman Neymar and ever-reliable full-back Danilo would only miss the Swiss game. .“Neymar and Danilo went through an MRI on Friday afternoon and we found ligament damage in the ankle of both of them,” Rodrigo Lasmar said in a statement shared by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) on Friday. .“They will miss the next game for sure, and we will be cautious as they will undergo treatment in order to try to get them in shape so they can play again in the World Cup.” .Neymar has had problems with his right foot and ankle for several years and looked distraught when he left the pitch late in Thursday’s match. .In the 2014 World Cup, he suffered a back injury in the quarter-final victory over Colombia, ruling him out of the 7-1 semifinal defeat by Germany. .At Russia 2018, injuries again hampered his dream of winning the World Cup. Early in 2018, Neymar suffered a sprained right ankle that affected the fifth metatarsal in his foot. .He missed 16 games for Paris St Germain at the end of the 2018-19 domestic season and was never fully fit as he played through pain for Brazil in Russia until they were knocked out by Belgium in the quarter-finals. .The forward suffered similar injuries in 2019 and again last year. .His replacement should be Real Madrid prodigy Rodrygo. However, the biggest question mark is regarding Danilo’s replacement, as 39-year-old veteran Dani Alves is the only right-back available. .The former Barcelona man played his last game for Mexican side UNAM Pumas in September and sustained a knee injury that has been troubling him since. .Brazil coach Tite tested Real Madrid centre-back Eder Militao as a full-back in their friendly match against Ghana and could be another option along with Liverpool midfielder Fabinho, who also has played as a right-back before. .Winger Antony and midfielder Lucas Paqueta are both ill and could also miss the match against Switzerland on Monday.",395

The youthful American side, full of pace and skill, kept England on the back foot for much of the game. .The Three Lions, famously defeated by the US at the 1950 World Cup, didn’t manage a shot on goal in the second half until the 87th minute, with only three shots on goal in the whole match. .“It wasn’t our best performance for sure,” England captain Harry Kane told ITV Sport after the match. .“It was a complete contrast with the game against Iran. We had two or three opportunities, and we didn’t put it away. They pressed really well. We knew before the game they would come out and make it difficult for us. .“We know we can play better than that … no game is easy in a World Cup. We were playing against a really organised team with some quality players and you have to respect that.” .The US were bolder than in the 1-1 draw with Wales and dominated in the first half. Haji Wright, the only new name in the starting line-up, headed wide before Weston McKennie fired over and Christian Pulisic rattled the woodwork. .Kane had one early effort blocked and Mason Mount had England’s best first-half chance saved. .The US dropped back in the second half and defended as a unit when needed, giving England little room to work with. .“Every time you can get a shut out in the World Cup it is a good thing,” said US coach Gregg Berhalter. “We know five points gets us in. We have to concentrate on the five points.” .Even with this result, England – now on four points – will qualify for the Round of 16, unless Wales beat them by four or more goals when they face off next Tuesday. .The fate of the USA, currently on two points, is now somewhat out of their control; a win for the Stars and Stripes against Iran, combined with England maintaining their unbeaten run against Wales, will see the Americans through to the knockout stages. .Other combinations of results get complicated quickly, meaning that goal differences could prove decisive. Iran and the USA have only played once before in a World Cup – a 2-1 victory for Iran in 1998. .With tempo lacking on Friday night from the starting eleven who had performed so decisively against Iran in their opening match, England coach Gareth Southgate put on winger Jack Grealish, and replaced Raheem Sterling and Jude Bellingham, whose anticipated fire never seemed to spark, with defensive midfielder Jordan Henderson. .England had more possession as the game progressed into the final quarter, but struggled to convert this into decent chances. Captain Harry Kane headed wide, while the introduction of Marcus Rashford also failed to help. Some England fans were heard booing at the final whistle.",396
397,Published On 25 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Why Americans call it soccer,Al Jazeera looks into the origins and history of the debate around the name of the ‘beautiful game’.,".In the 2022 World Cup anthem “Tokoh Taka”, US rapper Nicki Minaj proclaims: “Some say football, some say soccer.” .While many fans around the world find the term “soccer” strange, if not objectionable, that’s what Americans – as well as Canadians, South Africans and some Australians and Irish – call the sport. .As the US team took on England in their second match in Qatar, the familiar football-versus-soccer debate was reigniting off the pitch. .Ahead of the US-England game on Friday, posts and memes stressing that “it’s not soccer” flooded social media, and a video shared by the publication Sports Illustrated showed US fans chanting, “It’s called soccer”. .Here, Al Jazeera looks at the origins of the discrepancy in what the two English-speaking countries call the sport. .It may sound counterintuitive, but the term “soccer” was not originally American. Like the modern sport itself, the name originated in Great Britain. .As authors Silke-Maria Weineck and Stefan Szymanski explain in their book, It’s Football, Not Soccer (And Vice Versa), the formal name of the sport is “association football”. British university students in the late 19th century nicknamed it “soccer”, a twist on the second syllable of “association”. .But while British people stopped using the nickname decades ago, Americans stuck to it. .In an interview with Al Jazeera, Szymanski, a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan, stressed that as much as Britons may loathe the term “soccer”, its origins are indisputable. He tracked its use in the United Kingdom well into the second half of the 20th century. .For example, the 1973 autobiography of the legendary Manchester United coach Matt Busby is titled Soccer at the Top: My Life in Football. .Szymanski has a theory to explain the decline of the word “soccer” in England: “anti-Americanism”. .“When it became widely known in the UK that Americans called it soccer, it suddenly becomes what we call an ‘exile word’ in British English,” he said. .Throughout sports history, the term “football” has been used to describe several sports involving a ball and running, including rugby, which is formally called rugby football. .As association football and rugby football were taking shape in the UK in the 1800s, another football genre was developing in North America, combining elements from both sports. It came to be known as gridiron football. .Several versions of gridiron football would spring up, including Canadian football, but American football became the dominant one. It evolved to include an oval-shaped ball and pauses after each tackle. That sport came to be known in the US simply as “football”, and was embraced as a national pastime there. .So as the world largely moved on from the word “soccer”, for Americans, another sport had taken the honour of being called football. .“Calling soccer ‘football’ would invite confusion” in the US, said G Edward White, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of Soccer in American Culture: The Beautiful Game’s Struggle for Status. .White pointed to gridiron football’s prevalence in many US institutions, where it is “played extensively in high schools, colleges and the professional National Football League“. .With the Hispanic population among the fastest-growing demographics in the US, an increasing number of Americans know the sport not as “soccer” but as “futbol”. The Spanish word is becoming more popular among non-Spanish speakers as well.  But efforts to rebrand “soccer” are still a long way from making a meaningful dent in the term’s use. .After all, the official name of the American team playing in Qatar is the “United States Men’s National Soccer Team”. .Szymanski dismissed the entire football-soccer debate as silly. .“In countries where you have other versions of football, the word soccer is just the most sensible word to use,” he said. “And that’s the funny thing about it. Why would you object to people trying to avoid confusing language? So it’s all part of the craziness.”",397

It left Qatar with zero points after losing 3-1 to Senegal hours earlier. .Ecuador dominated much of the game after Cody Gakpo fired the Dutch into a sixth-minute lead.

Senegal beat Qatar 3-1 earlier in the other Group A match of the day. .Cody Gakpo, the PSV Eindhoven forward who has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester United, put the Netherlands in front with a superb strike in the sixth minute at the Al Khalifa International Stadium. .But with a large and vociferous support behind them, Ecuador fought back with such ferocity that the Dutch were rattled – and an Ecuador goal disallowed just before half-time gave an indication of the one-way traffic which was to follow in the second half. .Minutes into the second period, Enner Valencia became this World Cup’s highest goal scorer – so far – with a goal in the 49th minute. It was the captain’s third goal of the campaign after his brace in his country’s opening win over Qatar. .With the Netherlands and Ecuador now both on four points in Group A, followed by Senegal with three, Qatar cannot now qualify for the knock-out stages as they stand at the bottom of the table with zero points ahead of their last match against the Dutch side. .Very few would have expected the hosts to get out of the group, but they will be disappointed to go into the last group game with nothing on the line. .Ecuador could even have won this game, with Gonzalo Plata crashing a shot off the crossbar just before the hour mark. La Tri put in 23 crosses to the Netherlands’ seven in a sign that if anyone was about to net a winner, it wasn’t going to be the Dutch. .An encouraging evening for Ecuador was marred by the sight of Valencia coming off on a stretcher late on and then sitting with ice around his right knee, and they will hope their all-time top scorer can recover quickly. .Ecuador play Senegal in the last round of their group matches on Tuesday, while the Netherlands face Qatar, knowing a draw is all they need to guarantee their place in the round of 16.",399

At the same time, the home supporters turned out in maroon shirts, with many of the men opting for the traditional Middle Eastern thobe, a pristine white ankle-length tunic. .Qatar showed some flashes of exciting attacking play, but the reigning Asian champions were undone by sloppy defending that was harshly punished by a Senegalese side that was just that little bit better in every department. .With Qatar defending well, it was going to take either a moment of magic or a catastrophic mistake for Senegal to break the deadlock. Unfortunately, for Qatar defender Boualem Khoukhi it turned out to be the latter. Striker Boulaye Dia scored Senegal’s first goal after Khoukhi tried to make a clearance under no pressure before falling down. .Senegal’s second goal came just three minutes after the break delivered by former Bristol City striker’s Famara Diedhiou header. .Mohammed Muntari reduced the deficit in the 78th with a bullet header from Ismail Mohamad’s cross for Qatar’s first-ever goal at a World Cup in their debut tournament, but Senegal was unruffled as they continued to out-muscle their opponents in midfield. .As the Qatari fans were hoping for the equaliser, Senegal’s Bamba Dieng scored his team’s third goal, leaving the host team bottom of the group without a point after two games played. .In truth, with the Dutch still to come, the Qataris have next to no chance of making it out of the group, but coach Felix Sanchez told reporters that he and his team had never expected to set the world on fire, despite being at home. .“Expectations were set to give a good performance and organise a good World Cup, and that is the case,” he told a news conference, praising his players for their efforts.",400

I don’t know the reason, he might have some other plans for them. .“But I believe the selection of players was not good in our first game, even today, as well. We won in the last minute. It was not that great of a win. I hope in future games the coach will let other players on the team play.” .“The whole of Iran knows we could have done better in the opener – 6-2 is not very Iran standard. Whenever I think of that match, my heart breaks. I am very pleased but I expected at least a 6-0 win today, we deserve more, Iran deserve more. .“We have to win the US match and we will definitely go to the knockout stage without a doubt. We are going to prove to the world. .“We lost the first game because of many reasons, our goalkeeper got injured in the first few minutes, fans were upset, everything bad happened that day.

In a little more than a decade, roads, highways and bridges were constructed, easily connecting the entire country. .Since being awarded hosting rights in 2010, Qatar has spent more than $200bn on developing and improving infrastructure, including building seven new football stadiums. .“We only had 12 years to build the infrastructure, build these highways, make sure [Qatar] has public transportation and roads for easy access for all the stadiums,” says al-Ali, a mother of three in her 40s. .“Getting from my new house to my in-laws or parents, back then it would take me half an hour, now it takes me 15 minutes,” she says, referring to the highways and roads built over time. .“We are so proud of hosting the World Cup and the achievements that Qatar made,” says al-Ali, adding that the event itself is a “moment” she has been waiting for since 2010. .As it’s the first time for an Arab, Muslim country in the Middle East to host “a grand event such as the World Cup … it is our time to shine,” al-Ali said. .“It is our time to show the world that we are a part of you, we are as good as you to host it. Sports unites all nations together. .“It’s not only Qatar that is hosting the World Cup, it’s the whole region that is hosting it.” .Sheikh Suhaim al-Thani, 31, a manager at Qatar Free Zones Authority, which helps foreign businesses wanting to work in the country, told Al Jazeera the sporting event is not just a Qatari accomplishment but one “for all Arabs, Muslims, and anyone who genuinely enjoys football”. .“Qatar is the smallest country to ever be able to accommodate the needs of such a tournament,” a visibly proud al-Thani said. .The entire country comprises just 11,586 square kilometres (4,473 square miles), making it smaller than the Australian city of Sydney. It is just a 200km (124 mile) drive to reach the northernmost point in Qatar from the very south of the peninsula. .Al-Thani will be watching eight matches in the stadiums but has planned fun evenings with his friends for other games at his majlis, a traditional room in Qatari homes where friends, family and community members gather to socialise. .The aroma of Arabic incense popularly known as bakhoor fills the air at his majlis, an extended part of his home on the outskirts of the Qatari capital, Doha. .Al-Thani believes that the event can show Western sceptics how an Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern country can successfully pull off such a big event. .He said he feels the overarching narrative in the Western media about Qatar hosting the Cup has been negative and lopsided. .“These [media] accounts do not describe how much Qatar has transformed over the years,” he said. .“Qatar has transformed beyond recognition in the past few years, we are greener, there’s so much innovation, digital transformation. All of it has come together just in time for the World Cup. This is celebration time,” he said. .For Maha Kafoud, 21, a student who has been studying psychology in Melbourne, Australia, it is not just the country’s infrastructure that she has seen change noticeably over the years. .Since she last returned to Qatar for a visit in January 2020, she has started noticing shifts within Qatari society. .“Before, if a Qatari woman wasn’t wearing an abaya, everyone would freak out, look at her and judge her. But since I’ve been back, I’ve been wearing hoodies and going around Doha to all the new venues and stuff, and really no one cares,” Kafoud said. .“I’ve been seeing [Qatari] men and women together and no one bats an eye when they see that, either,” she said, adding that with so many people from around the world arriving in Qatar, the change is “an expected thing”. .Since returning earlier this month to watch the World Cup, Kafoud said the country feels “even more progressive and welcoming … all of this while still holding onto our culture and traditions”. .Kafoud attended Sunday’s opening ceremony with her father, an avid football fan who played the sport for 20 years when he started his own local team in Qatar called Al-Matar Al-Qadeem. .“That was a historic event that I’ll remember for the rest of my life,” Kafoud said. .“We truly showed our culture to the entire world … Knowing that millions of people saw the way we dance, heard our songs, heard the Quran being played; it was just such a beautiful thing.” .Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman narrated the opening segment, telling viewers, “We all gather here in one big tribe.” .Presenting alongside Freeman was Ghanim al-Muftah, a 20-year-old Qatari man who was born with a rare condition that impairs the development of the lower spine. He recited a verse from the holy Quran calling for global unity. .“O humanity! Indeed, we created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may get to know one another,” he recited. . .For the opening match where Qatar played Ecuador, around 60,000 fans were packed into the Al Bayt Stadium in the city of Al-Khor, whose exterior was designed to resemble a traditional Bedouin tent. .Fireworks, singing and dancing marked the opening ceremony, with performances mixing themes of Qatari tradition with other cultures. .“It was such a moment of pride for me and I think to all Qataris as well, even foreigners … we were all left in tears,” Kafoud said. .“I don’t think that’s ever been done before, where we [Qataris] were able to show a part of our Arab and Muslim heritage to the entire world.” .Even after the World Cup is over, Kafoud said she is “looking forward to seeing the change” that she hopes will follow. .“I’m hoping that these 28 days will influence [Qatari] society to become more open minded and more welcoming of foreigners in general. Although there are a lot of foreigners here – there are more foreigners than Qataris – but there’s a divide, a separation, and I’m hoping that after the World Cup, it will be more united.” .The al-Ali family and their three children are excited to see the football games in person, and have bought tickets to six different games at various stadiums to get “the full experience”. .Their house, which they once worried was too isolated, is now near one of the stadiums hosting the tournament in Lusail including matches with Portugal and Argentina, teams the family will be cheering for from the stands. .“We are a fan of [Argentina’s Lionel] Messi and [Portugal’s Cristiano] Ronaldo and I understand it’s their last World Cup … so it’s nice to come and see,” al-Ali said. .“I’ve been to the Arab Cup, and I’ve been to the Asia Cup, so it’s so exciting to now attend a World Cup … Qatar brought the World Cup to us so we have to take advantage, attend it and experience it.”",406

However, despite the task on hand, fans have come out in support of the home team. .“We don’t want to bring them under any pressure that they must win, we just want them to have a good game,” Ali Ghanem, a teenage fan of the home team, told Al Jazeera. .Qatar, one of the lowest-ranked teams in the tournament, is making its World Cup debut by virtue of being the host. .Despite being the current Asian champions and having improved their rankings in the last few years, Al Annabi have been unable to cope with the pressure the tournament brings. .While captain Hassan Al-Haydos, Akram Afif, Saad Al-Sheeb and Almoez Ali may be household names in the Gulf state, none of them has played club football outside Qatar and are relatively unknown to the outside world. .According to Amine, a Tunisian fan, having the world’s eyes on them for the first time made the team nervous. .“It was a historic moment for them. Now, with the first match gone, Qatari people should let the team go and enjoy themselves instead of expecting them to win,” he said. .Ismaeel Mohammad, a Qatari team member, called on the fans to get behind the team. .“Our team needs its fans now more than ever,” he said during a news conference on the eve of the match. .Fans duly obliged and turned out to support their team in Doha’s Musheireb area on Thursday evening. They walked down to the Al Annabi Village, a fan zone for Qatar’s supporters at Musheireb, with their maroon and white Qatar flags. .Large video screens at the fan zone showed the team’s achievements at the Asian Cup and the Arab Cup as fans sang along to popular songs. .Qatar’s coach Felix Sanchez admitted his team crumbled under pressure against Ecuador. .“We hope that now we are free from all this pressure that we had in the opening match,” he told reporters on Thursday. .“I hope we can compete and show that we can be more competitive than the other day, regardless of what is the result.” .If Qatar fails to win, it will become only the second host nation after South Africa (2010) to crash out at the first hurdle. .The team said it will try to take inspiration from Saudi Arabia, which beat Argentina 2-1 in their opening match as well as the other Arab teams who have done well in the tournament. .Sonia Nemmas, a Jordanian mother of three football-mad girls, said her family has always supported Qatar and has high hopes for the team. .“If they manage to get at least one win and one draw from the remaining two matches, we may still [have] a miracle,” she said. .Nemmas thinks Akram Afif and AbdelKarim Hassan will be the stand-out players for Qatar. .“Even if they manage to come away from the group stage with a point, we will be happy.”",407

But a loss for the US could leave them struggling.,".Who: England vs USA, Group B .Where: Al Bayt Stadium .When: Friday, November 25, at 10pm (19:00 GMT) .Ranking: England (5), USA (16) .Buoyed by their sparkling 6-2 victory over Iran, England will go into Friday’s fixture against the USA brimming with confidence and knowing another win will secure their progression to the World Cup’s knockout phase. .Gareth Southgate’s squad will be looking to build on Monday’s promising performance and has been boosted by news that captain and star striker Harry Kane is expected to be fit to play after the 29-year-old recuperated from an ankle injury picked up in the Three Lions’ opening fixture. .Expect Kane to be assisted by Bukayo Saka, who scored twice in the win against Iran, and 19-year-old midfielder Jude Bellingham, who notched his first international goal in England’s opening game. .For their part, the USA will be seeking an improved showing after an initially promising start against Wales on Monday gave way to a disappointing 1-1 draw, with Gareth Bale’s second-half penalty cancelling out Timothy Weah’s 36th-minute opener. .“Captain America” Christian Pulisic, who plies his trade for Chelsea in England’s Premier League, will again lead the side from the front. Several other members of the squad are also Premier League regulars. .But familiarity will count for nothing on both sides of the Atlantic and inside the confines of the Al Bayt Stadium, where the so-called “special relationship” between the two countries will be put on pause for 90 minutes as they battle for supremacy on the pitch. .England are expected to come out on top, with their opening win demonstrating a dramatic return to form after a pre-tournament dip in results saw them go six games without a victory. .Southgate’s decision to employ a more-attack-minded 4-3-3 formation – a switch away from his previously-favoured 3-5-2 system – paid dividends, with the midfield trio of Bellingham, Declan Rice and Mason Mount offering dynamism and creativity in abundance. .Other positives for the side saw winger Raheem Sterling, who was under pressure coming into the World Cup following a string of limp displays for Chelsea, cap off a lively display with a 46th-minute goal. Substitutes Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford also found the back of the net late on. .However, alarm bells were raised after the match by both Southgate and several of his players over basic defensive lapses which allowed Iran to beat goalkeeper Jordan Pickford twice. .They know that the USA possess the quality to capitalise on any repeat of those errors and are also likely to offer greater resistance at the back than the Iranians could muster. .But the pressure is overwhelmingly on USA coach Gregg Berhalter’s players. A loss on Friday will leave them needing to win their last game – against Iran – to stand any chance of progressing past the group stage.",408

When: Friday, November 25, 7pm (16:00 GMT) .The Netherlands Oranje team – a mix of veterans like Liverpool centre-back Virgil van Dijk and youngsters like forward Cody Gakpo, assembled by coaching legend Louis van Gaal – are seeking to reannounce themselves as a force to reckon with after missing the 2018 World Cup in Russia. .“In my opinion, the team we have is a great mix of experience and talent, and the team spirit is incredible,” van Dijk said in a GQ interview just before the tournament began. “We don’t have superstars and in some ways that could help, but so far we have been really enjoying playing with each other as a team, as a group.” .“I think everyone within the camp and within the group and the manager, is confident,” the Oranje captain added. .Two late goals by Cody Gakpo and Davy Klaassen against Senegal in the first game on November 21 helped put their mission on a good path. .The team will be hoping to use their dangerous counterattacking style to inflict more pain in their second game against Ecuador, who are buoyed by their 2-0 defeat of hosts Qatar. .The game kicks off at Khalifa International Stadium at 7pm. .Both teams go into their second match knowing that a win would consolidate their positions ahead of any final match-day blues. .Barcelona attacker on the Dutch side, Memphis Depay, whose runs peppered the Senegalese defense in the second half of the first match, came on from the bench having not played since mid-September because of a hamstring injury. .He is expected to play this second game from the start and spearhead the quest to get a good result going as early as possible, rather than leave it late as was the case with Senegal. .Gakpo, one of the hottest prospects in world football, could be just as dangerous as he continues with what pundits are calling an audition for Europe’s biggest club sides. .But Ecuador Manager Gustavo Julio Alfaro will be banking on two-goal hero Enner Valencia to help the South American team attempt to pull off a third key upset in Qatar – after Japan’s defeat of Germany and Saudi Arabia’s humiliation of Argentina.",409
410,Published On 25 Nov 2022,Swag? Success? Why Brazilian football is loved across the world,Brazil’s opening World Cup win saw an enormous crowd cheer the men in yellow. And most of them were not even Brazilians.,".Doha, Qatar – There are low-flying F-16s and there are more than 60,000 Brazil fans celebrating a World Cup goal. Which is louder? .I got my answer after Richarlison scored Brazil’s second goal against Serbia in the teams’ opening World Cup match at Lusail Stadium on Thursday. And there were no F-16s present. .In between roughing up the opposition and inviting fouls, Brazil continued to mesmerise the 89,000-something present at the stadium. For either of those two goals, the noise levels would have far exceeded what Lusail Stadium has witnessed during a handful of football matches and concerts that have taken place there. .Brazilians love their football. By the show of hands on Sunday, so does the rest of the world. And this is no secret. .When Kozhikode in India and Lyari in Pakistan bring out murals, flags and replica t-shirts bearing the names of Brazilian greats past and present, you know it’s the World Cup. .And now, Doha has been added to that list. .Most of the Brazil supporters inside Lusail Stadium on Thursday evening were not from Brazil. They have been labelled “fake fans” by some segments of Western media, but there was no fakeness about the authenticity and integrity of this group that knew, and lauded, what Brazilian players have given football for decades. .Brazil has won the World Cup five times, more than any other team. They lost two finals, and also finished third twice. It’s definitely the success that brings the fans to the yard … but it’s also the swag and the skills. .“The way they play, oh my God, it’s beyond fantastic, the pace, the attack, the style, it’s breathtaking,” Ashiq, who hails from Kerala state in India, told Al Jazeera after the scintillating show on Thursday. .He trembled while thinking of the most apt adjective to describe the performance before carrying on. .“I don’t remember when I started supporting Brazil but I’m glad I did. It’s astonishing how they keep producing the class of players.” .Laeth from Jordan did remember when he started following the men in yellow and also why. .“We’ve been watching them play since we were young. It’s just fascinating to watch them play: the ability, the skills,” he told Al Jazeera. .“You see the second goal [Richarlison with a scissor kick after a deft show of pure control] and you’ll know what I’m talking about. No other team can score a goal like that. Only Brazil.” .Karina and Merari are two Mexican friends visiting Qatar for the World Cup. While their national team remains their true footballing love, on Thursday Carina donned the yellow of Brazil with both turning up to support Brazil. .“It’s because they are part of the Americas but also because of the football,” said Carina. .“I like them because of the players, the star quality they have. We’re Mexicans but we love football. That’s the main reason we came to watch this match,” replied Merari. .To see all this love pouring in from across the world has surprised Brazilians, including Juliana. .“It’s amazing to see how popular the team is across the world,” she said. “The impact it has, it’s amazing. We saw a lot of non-Brazilians support Brazil. Words can’t describe how we feel when our team is being supported like this. To see other people supporting Brazil, it’s beautiful.” .Brazil have not won the World Cup since 2002. The closest they came was at home in 2014. .However, memories of that semi-final will not bring much joy to the fans. They are instead hoping that the samba will bring joy to the desert this year.",410

Where: Ahmed bin Ali Stadium
When: Friday, November 25, 7pm (16:00 GMT)
Head to head: This is the first competitive fixture between the two nations. .Qatar, the first host nation in World Cup history to lose their opening fixture, will be keen to prevent another loss and consequently, an early exit from the competition by getting a good result against Senegal, who also lost their first game. .To keep hopes of staying in the tournament alive, both sides must avoid a loss at the 40,000-capacity Al Thumama Stadium, ahead of the last Group A matches on November 29. .There is a gulf between both sides on the FIFA rankings, with Senegal in 18th place, far above Qatar in 50th. .The Senegalese will look to translate this to on-the-pitch success and take advantage of the weaknesses the Ecuador team exploited in the opening game. .On their part, the Teranga Lions who conceded two late goals to the Oranje due to a goalkeeping error and defensive frailty will have to step up their game. .Qatari goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb who had a worse time in the first game than Senegal’s Edouard Mendy had in his, will have to stop an expected barrage of attempts from Senegalese attackers. .Left winger Ismaila Sarr who relentlessly troubled the Dutch defence with his mazy runs, dribbling, and shooting, may particularly fancy his chances in a bid to cushion the loss of injured talisman Sadio Mane. .Mane, a two-time African Footballer of the Year, was injured while playing for Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, after being expected to shoulder the expectations of the West African nation. .Coach Aliou Cisse will be hoping his forwards who are present in Doha are less profligate on Friday against the Qataris who succumbed easily to Ecuador. .  .Ecuador and Netherlands, who both racked up convincing wins in their first game of the 2022 World Cup against Qatar and Senegal respectively, will each be hoping to pick another three points from this game. .Both sides go into the game knowing that a win for either will send that team into the Round of 16, likely as top of the group.",411

Yet that came right after their dramatic World Cup qualifying campaign, during which they lost only one match in 10 – and that was to Belgium, who are among the favourites to lift the trophy in Doha on December 18. .So what does that tell us? When on form and without injury, the Welsh veteran trio of Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen can make life very difficult for opposing teams. .But that is no small caveat. Allen continues to slog on in Swansea – where he injured his hamstring less than a month ago. Meanwhile, Ramsey, who picked up a hamstring injury in September, and Bale, who also had a recent leg injury, have traded in the rugged mountains and valleys of Wales for the warmer climes of Nice and Los Angeles – where they both struggle to get game time. .The Welsh reliance on its experienced stars was on show in the team’s opening game of the World Cup, where a late Bates penalty ensured they got a point through a draw against the United States. .Iran, meanwhile, want to make a round of 16 appearance for the first time at a World Cup. And this game is key to those hopes after Team Melli – as they are known – were trounced 6-2 by England in their opening game of the World Cup. .Like Wales, they will depend on an experienced hand – or rather, foot. Since the 2020-21 season, Mehdi Taremi has been the top scorer in Portugal’s football league, with 42 goals. The 30-year-old, who scored both of Iran’s goals against England earlier this week, has 18 months of experience playing in Qatar. .Taremi will be leading Iran’s front line, along with Alireza Jahanbakhsh of Feyenoord Rotterdam and Sardar Azmoun from Bayer Leverkusen. Azmoun was injured while playing for Leverkusen in early October, but is fit to play in Qatar. .In the two games since Iran’s Coach Carlos Queiroz has been reinstated, the team have played a 4-1-4-1 defensive formation with a floating player ahead of the defenders, allowing the midfield to press further up the pitch. In attack, they have switched to 4-3-3. .This flexibility in formation and counterattack give Team Melli a similar style of play to the Dragons – the nom de guerre of the Welsh side. Expect fast breaks along the wings from both teams. These are not teams interested in possession for its own sake. Don’t be expecting much tiki-taka in this game. Do be expecting pacy, box-to-box action.",412

Attacking midfielder Lucas Paqueta played alongside Casemiro, the lone defensive midfielder. .But Serbia had several players back and were able to keep the men in yellow from creating many significant opportunities.

One sentence reads: “At the time of their arrest, the Ukrainians made no resistance.” Such a phrase would not have escaped our copy editors. .Mnar Adley, editor of MintPressNews, a left-wing website, was among those who sent out a tweet with the video. .At the time of writing, her post had been shared by more than 2,000 Twitter users. .“Ukrainians were arrested in Qatar after they drew swastikas on football posters,” she wrote, alongside the video, to her following of 23,300 users. . .  .User @LogKa11, who has almost 14,000 followers, wrote “Nazi Ukrainians were arrested in Qatar after they drew swastikas on football posters”, as they shared the video.

422,Published On 24 Nov 2022,Yemenis divided over support for Saudi Arabia after World Cup win,"Several leaders of the Houthi rebels initially congratulated the Saudi team, before retracting their comments.",".Among the thousands of tweets that were sent out celebrating Saudi Arabia’s shock 2-1 victory over Argentina in the World Cup on Tuesday, there were a few from unexpected sources. .“A thousand congratulations for the victory of the Saudi national team over its Argentina team. This victory put Arab football back on the map,” Dhaifallah al-Shami, a member of the political bureau of Yemen’s rebel Houthi movement, tweeted. .Why unexpected? .The Houthis have been actively fighting a war against Saudi Arabia since 2015, with the latter conducting thousands of air attacks in support of the Houthis’ enemy, the Yemeni government. .In fact, the Houthis have described Saudi Arabia as the “devil’s horn”. .So it was not surprising when al-Shami soon deleted his tweet. .Abdulqader al-Mortada, the Houthi chairman of the National Committee for Prisoners’ Affairs, was another who deleted his tweet congratulating Saudi Arabia. He also tweeted “a thousand congratulations” to the Saudi team for their win in a post later deleted. .Al-Mortada later explained that his tweet was a message of brotherhood to the people of “Hejaz and Najd”, using the names of two well-known regions in Saudi Arabia, rather than the country’s name itself. .“The wounds of our people from the House of Saud are deep … I offer my deepest apologies,” al-Mortada added. .The Houthi members’ initial posts reflect a degree of support for the Saudi team during the World Cup, which has spanned Yemen’s political divide. .Some Yemenis even took to the streets in celebration of celebrations and joy on the streets. .Videos of the celebrations have spread widely across social media, with one Yemeni user saying the Saudi win had “warmed our hearts and raised the Arabs’ head [made us proud], making Yemenis happy everywhere, as if it were the Yemeni national team”. . .Some anti-Houthi Yemenis shared the videos, with one user saying, “celebrations in Arabia Felix [Yemen], even after the air strikes exhausted them”. . .Yemen has been mired in conflict since 2014, when the Iran-allied Houthi rebel movement seized much of the northern part of the country, including the capital, Sanaa, as the government fled. In March 2015, a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia intervened in the war with the aim of restoring the government. .The conflict has devastated the country, created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and over the years turned into a regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. More than 150,000 people have been killed, including 14,500 civilians. .For some Yemenis, that simply cannot be ignored. .Mohammad Abdelwasi al-Wajeeh, a TV anchor for the Houthis’ Al Masirah channel, said he was offended by Yemeni support for Saudi Arabia. .“Whoever said that football is a soft war [soft power] method by which Westerners pass on whatever they want to billions of people … is right,” al-Wajeeh said. .“It offended me a lot when the majority congratulated the Saudi team because they are Arab … they can all go to hell.” .Another Houthi supporter on Twitter said he “did not, and will not, celebrate the Saudi national team’s win over Argentina”, before referring to the support of members of the Saudi national team for the country’s military. .",422

There was no Israel until it occupied Palestine.” .Nearby, a group of men and women gathered in a circle and a loud cheer went up as music began playing from a speaker. As the lyrics rang out, they began singing and dancing along to a popular Palestinian song called Dammi Falastini (My Blood is Palestinian). .Bader explains that the song tells the story of Palestine. .“The lyrics are heart-wrenching and sad, but because the Israeli occupation and our inability to be in our homeland is a part of our lives, we celebrate our identity by singing and dancing along to such songs.” .Bader, who was barely audible over the loud singing and cheering, pointed out a few Moroccan, Tunisian, Egyptian and Qatari flags amongst the crowd. .“They are not Palestinian but when they hear this song or spot our flag, they are pulled towards it, as being Muslims they support our cause and feel our pain,” he explained before going on to join the group. . .The Palestinian support has not just been limited to singing and dancing. .Social media posts show fans who, upon realising that they are being interviewed by Israeli media, have walked away from reporters. Meanwhile, others have seized the opportunity and shouted “viva Palestine!” into their microphones. .For the first time, direct flights between Tel Aviv and Doha have brought fans to the World Cup, despite the lack of official ties between Israel and Qatar. .“Putting our identity out there when the whole world is watching helps our cause,” said Asma Jaber, a Palestinian who has travelled to Qatar from the United States for the tournament. .Jaber, too, had a keffiyeh draped across her shoulders and a small Palestinian flag in her hands. .“To be able to show our identity openly and with pride is a unique feeling for Palestinians,” Jaber said, as she explained that she carried a Palestinian flag wherever she went, despite there not being many places in the world she feels comfortable waving it. .Her son Safwan had a large Palestinian flag tied around his neck. He held it up over his head and said, “this is my cape. It makes me feel like superman”. .Jaber grew up in a Jordanian refugee camp until she finished high school, and then moved to the US. .“My grandparents moved to Jordan in 1948, following the Nakba [catastrophe],” she said, referring to the forced expulsion of Palestinians in 1948 upon the creation of Israel. .Like millions of other Palestinian refugees, Jaber has never been to Palestine. .She looked around her as she stood in the middle of Lusail Boulevard, a wide road that runs from Lusail Stadium to the town centre. It has been pedestrianised and decorated with flags from participating nations. .“I can’t put into words how I feel when I see my flag being raised by so many people who are not from Palestine,” Jaber said. .She took a moment to hold back her emotions and said, “It’s as if all these people from around the world are saying, ‘We love you, we know you exist, and we are by your side.’” .“Palestinians often feel that they are facing the strongest powers in the world and fighting for their cause all on their own. .But seeing this support makes us feel stronger.”",423

427,Published On 24 Nov 2022,Criticism of Qatar ‘excessive’ says French football chief: Report,French Football Federation President Noël Le Graët defends the decision to host the World Cup in Qatar.,".French Football Federation President Noël Le Graët has defended Qatar as the host of the 2022 World Cup, saying there has been “an excessive campaign” against the country. .In an interview to the French channel RTL, Le Graët said: ” I believe this country [Qatar] is what it is. I look at the football side. It is up to the politicians to do their job.” .His comments mirror a similar sentiment to the one FIFA President Gianni Infantino has expressed, requesting participating countries to “focus on the football”. .Qatar won its bid to host the global football tournament in 2010 but has since faced a barrage of criticism on the rights of workers, the LGBTQ community and others. However, many experts have also accused the West of hypocrisy in the manner in which Qatar has been targeted. The country has also faced racist stereotyping — including in a French cartoon recently. .In his interview, Le Graët pointed out that Qatar and France have a strong economic partnership. “The two governments get along not so badly,” he said. He later used the Qatari businessman Nasser bin Ghanim al-Khelaifi’s ownership of French football club Paris Saint-Germain as an example. .Le Graët also hailed the World Cup as a success so far, “the proof is that the [TV] record was beaten on Tuesday evening; the bistros and cafes were full everywhere”. The French football boss had earlier said he would rather France captain Hugo Lloris not wear the “One Love” armband at the World Cup. .The captains of seven European teams had planned to wear the rainbow-coloured armbands as part of an anti-discrimination campaign but backed down after FIFA threatened disciplinary action. .“It’s not that I’m not in favour of this armband, but sometimes I think we want to lecture others so much that we should also look at what’s happening in our country,” Le Graët had said.",427
428,Published On 24 Nov 2022,"The rise of Mohammed Kudus, pride of Nima and Ghana’s golden boy","How dedication, ability and hard work led the footballer from his hometown to becoming a key member of the Black Stars.",".Accra, Ghana – In Nima, Mohammed Kudus commands god-like status. In the dense neighbourhood of Accra that he calls home, there is pride in the locals’ voices when his name is mentioned. .Fans of his club Ajax know him for scoring goals, dribbling, creating chances and occasionally pulling off a cheeky piece of skill on the football pitch. .To the people of Nima though, he’ll always be that innocent-looking, scrawny kid who captivated them with his magical left foot at craggy Kawukudi Park for years. .One episode from his time there with his boyhood club Strong Tower FC is fondly etched in the minds of many of his hometown fans. .During a high-profile friendly against Powerlines FC at junior level, an 11-year-old Kudus carried the team on his shoulders, dominating the game and showing an innate precision rare in footballers his age. In the end, he netted all six goals as Strong Tower drew 6-6 with their opponents. .To date, the memory of the young star outclassing his opponents on that day in 2011 remains an anecdote held dear in these parts. .“I first saw Kudus play on the street, and I immediately saw a good player in him,” says Joshua ‘Ayoba’ Awuah, the manager of Strong Tower, who discovered Kudus and set him on a path to greatness. .“I invited him to my training ground, and he was fantastic from day one,” Awuah said. “I named him ‘world’s best’. He was only 10 years when I met him, but his quality was clear.” .Nima, a slum community in Accra, is typically associated with gangs, crime and drug abuse. Until recently, anyone born or raised there was stereotyped as bad company. .In recent years, a number of its residents have defied these stereotypes, including President Nana Akufo-Addo, and Kudus who has been using football to shine a light on the neighbourhood. .To King Osei Gyan, a director at Right to Dream Academy in Akosombo in eastern Ghana where Kudus eventually went, he “represents the next generation of top talent from Africa who really know their self-worth and they’ll fight for it and stand for it”. .The athlete’s willingness to combine football with education also helped in his breakthrough, those who know him said. Young Kudus was gifted on the pitch and brilliant in the classroom. Something that helped him do both was a football tournament organised in Nima by a nonprofit called Books and Boots. .The NGO specifically targets communities faced with poverty, crime, drug abuse and teenage pregnancy with the aim of using football to encourage children to adopt a culture of reading. .Nima ticked all the boxes. .“Kudus must have been around 12 years and he was very smallish,” recalled Yaw Ampofo-Ankrah, the CEO of Books and Boots. “He wasn’t necessarily a standout player, but he had the skills. Apparently, he crossed the road from Nima with his brothers and cousins and played.” .“Those who watched him closely were, however, very impressed, and after the event, a Right to Dream scout approached me and asked permission to talk to the boy’s representatives,” he said. .That was how Kudus ended up at the Right to Dream Academy. He was raw but fit seamlessly into his new surroundings, his coaches said. .“Kudus showed great potential the first day he walked in,” said Oman Abdul Rabi, Right to Dream’s skills development coach. “The way he was taking his touches, his movement and general play, you could see that he had potential.” .In his six years at the academy, Kudus gave it his all, playing across midfield and occasionally being moved up top due to his versatility. Beyond his talent, his strong character made him a popular figure among his teammates. .Gyan, one of the first batch of players who enrolled at the academy when it launched in 1999, went on to play for Fulham and was capped once by Ghana before eventually returning to the academy in an administrative role. .All that experience taught the 33-year-old to see that Kudus had the right mix of attitude, football ability, and hard work – traits that Gyan says have shaped him into the player he is today. .“From the very first day, Ayoba kept saying if Kudus would become the world’s best player,” Gyan said. “For me, the connection was his ability to try things, to flip the ball over people’s heads and to try to create things in the game and to make a difference.” .Of his many fond memories of Kudus’s time at Right to Dream, one, from a division two game, stands out. .“You know how lower division games are in Ghana with grown men,” Gyan said. “If you miss the ball, don’t miss the man. Kudus was around 16 then, but what made him special was his technical ability being so high against men and having that kind of grace to still compete physically and not necessarily get pulled into any fight or irritation, despite being constantly kicked, and still be the best. It said a lot about him as a teenager.” .Kudus was a key member of the academy team that went unbeaten during its European tour, winning four trophies, including the Nike World U15 Premier Cup. .“He was very tough to play against,” said Emmanuel Ogura, Kudus’s former teammate at Right to Dream. “He was very scary because he always wants to dribble and create something. I’m expecting to see him stand out more.” .By the time FC Nordsjaelland came calling in 2018, Kudus was ready to take on the world. A few days after his 18th birthday, he became Nordsjaelland’s ninth youngest debutant ever and ended up netting 11 goals in his only full season with the club .In the middle of 2020, 18 months into his stay in Denmark, he got a dream move to Ajax and has since grown in both status and mentality. .In 2020, he was nominated by Italy’s Tuttosport newspaper for its Golden Boy Award for being one of the most impressive youngsters playing in Europe that year. .Although niggling injuries blighted his first two seasons at Ajax, he has finally regained full fitness and is playing some of the best football of his career. .New manager Alfred Schreuder has deployed him as a false nine, rather than in his favoured playmaking role. Still, the 22-year-old has shone, netting 10 goals and two assists in all competitions this season, including four strikes in the UEFA Champions League. .Such has been Kudus’s rich vein of form that Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described him as an “incredible” player. French legend Thierry Henry has also been impressed, saying: “He came from the academy Right to Dream from Ghana, and he is living the dream.” .For Ghana, Kudus has also developed into a key member of the Black Stars since scoring on his international debut against South Africa in a 2021 AFCON qualifier and seems set to be influential at the Qatar 2022 World Cup. .In Nima, his story continues to inspire many people, and he often visits his boyhood club, Strong Tower, to donate boots and other items. .“Kudus now doesn’t just belong to the family, he’s for everybody,” said his uncle Abdul Fatawu Alhassan. “When you enter Nima, they call him ‘The Pride of Nima’, and we’re happy he’ll be representing us at the World Cup. .“He’s a big inspiration to kids too – not just upcoming footballers. Many see him as a role model. A few years ago, he was with them here, so when they see him playing for the Black Stars, in the UEFA Champions League and scoring, it inspires them to know that they can also make it.” .Nine-year-old Ramadan Osman, who frequently trains at Kawukudi Park in Nima, echoed Alhassan’s sentiments. “I’m a number 10, and I want to be the next Mohammed Kudus,” he confidently declared. .Friends and family say he remains grounded in reality but on the pitch displays the type of arrogance and temperament that many top players have in their locker. .Gyan, who has closely monitored Kudus’s footballing odyssey, credits the youngster’s humble background for this. .“In terms of personality or character, I’ll say Kudus brought Nima with him,” he said. “The can-do spirit of Nima – they’re known to be stubborn people. It’s that stubbornness balanced with flexible, applicable methods of getting to success.” .More than 30 million Ghanaians will be cheering Kudus and the Black Stars on in Qatar, but the loudest hurrah will probably come from Nima. While the world sees Kudus as a talented playmaker, they see him as far more – a torchbearer, an idol.",428

Can they ever get back to that old form? Maybe not, but they are likely to cause upset to others during their campaign. .Cameroon had a rocky route to World Cup qualification in what is their eighth appearance in the tournament, the most ever by an African team. .It will be a Trojan task for Cameroon to get out of the grouping with Switzerland, Serbia and pre-tournament favourites Brazil. .But, they’ve campaigned well before: The Indomitable Lions made history in 1990 when they qualified for the World Cup quarter-finals, the first team from the African continent to do so – only Senegal (2002) and Ghana (2010) have done so since. .Cameroon had to beat defending champions Argentina 1-0 to get there. .Switzerland is led by Granit Xhaka and the team possesses experience and quality in key midfield and defensive positions. But it will be Xhaka, 30, who is critical to Swiss success in Qatar. .But his temperament will be under scrutiny, particularly when the Swiss face off against Serbia on December 2. .Xhaka, who is of Kosovo-Albanian heritage, is notoriously feisty on the pitch and was fined by FIFA for making an eagle hand gesture four years ago while celebrating scoring in a 2-1 win over the Serbs at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. .The nationalist gesture symbolises the double-headed eagle on Albania’s national flag. .If Cameroon are to leave their mark on this World Cup that achievement will be led by goalkeeper Andre Onana and star midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa who both play in the Italian Serie A, as well as captain and veteran forward Vincent Aboubakar of Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr FC. .  .Uruguay vs South Korea  .The road to Qatar was not an easy one for Uruguay – La Celeste – who were at risk of missing out entirely and not qualifying at one stage. But they have arrived, and with high hopes – and with good reason. .Uruguay are in their group alongside Portugal, Ghana and South Korea, which will be hard work but La Celeste have beaten each of these three teams in previous World Cups, including knocking Portugal out of the tournament in 2018 and beating South Korea in their round-of-16 encounter in 2010. .The Qatar World Cup 2022 will be South Korea’s 10th consecutive appearance at the tournament and 11th in total. .No team from Asia has played in as many World Cups as the Taeguk Warriors. .South Korea have only made it past the group stages once in four attempts since 2002 and have won just three of their past 13 World Cup matches. One match was in 2018 in Russia, where they famously defeated defending champions Germany 2-0 and knocked them out of the tournament. .Their only appearance in the round-of-16 in the past 10 years came in 2010 when they were defeated by Uruguay, their opponents in their opening game on Thursday. .Luis Suarez was the star performer for Uruguay in the qualifiers, and while the presence of Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez bolsters their attack, the Uruguay front line continues to be led by the two veteran forwards. .Suarez and Edinson Cavani, both aged 35, have also been the protagonists of Uruguay’s success in the past decade, and this World Cup could be their final act. Between them, they have scored nine of Uruguay’s last 13 World Cup goals. .  .South Korea’s and Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min is hailed as an icon of South Korean football. .Though Son has struggled with his form with Tottenham this season, he enters this World Cup having scored four goals in his past six international appearances. .Portugal vs Ghana .Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo is on a mission. This is his last chance to win Portugal its first World Cup. .Portugal have reached the Euro semi-finals (2012), won their first major trophy (Euro 2016) and also lifted the inaugural Nations League title in 2019. .Yet, the team have been abysmal in World Cups and Portugal has not made it to the quarter-finals since 2006. .So, again, Portugal’s fate at the World Cup is closely tied to one man: Ronaldo – though his World Cup form raises some questions. .Doubts were cast over Ghana’s – the Black Stars – prospects in Qatar even before they arrived, as going into the World Cup, public sentiment on the streets of Accra and Kumasi was overwhelmingly negative. .How things have changed in just 12 years when back then Ghana become the third only-African side to reach the last-eight and only the second African team to advance to the knockout phases in back-to-back World Cups. .That momentum appears to have abandoned the squad and in their grouping, they will face some of the best attackers in the world of football: Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo, Uruguay’s Edinson Cavani and South Korea’s Son Heung-Min. .One word: Ronaldo .Brazil vs Serbia .In the World Cup qualifiers, Brazil chalked up an unbeaten route to Qatar, scoring 45 goals and conceding just five. .But the toughest battles are yet to come and Brazil has left the last four World Cups early after defeats at the hands of Europe’s footballing powerhouses: France and Zinedine Zidane in 2006, the Netherlands and Arjen Robben in 2010, Toni Kroos and Germany in 2014, and Belgium and Kevin De Bruyne in 2018. .Nevertheless, Brazil are five-time world champions and will be bursting with confidence in Qatar 2022 because they are no longer solely dependent on star striker Neymar, who is just three goals short of Pelé’s goal-scoring record for Brazil. .A new generation of Brazilian players has taken the weight off Neymar’s shoulders. .Serbia is making only its third appearance at the World Cup as an independent nation after debuting in South Africa in 2010. .Starting their campaign against Brazil – the World Cup’s perennial tournament favourites, Serbia will not be found wanting as they are a spirited and tight-knit side who are known for their strength in attacking. .They also qualified for the World Cup by beating Portugal away from home and topping their qualifying group. .Brazil has a new crop of footballing stars in Vinicius Junior, Richarlison de Andrade and Raphael Dias Belloli (Raphinha) – all ones to watch in this tournament. .Serbia’s Aleksandar Mitrovic, 28, is said to be in peak condition for this World Cup campaign. He was the top goal scorer in their World Cup qualifying group, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, with eight goals, and he also scored another six goals in the Nations League. .Mitrovic has a big role to play for Serbia in this campaign. .View the full 2022 World Cup schedule here and be sure to visit Al Jazeera’s AI match predictor to see how your team is projected to perform in Qatar.",430
431,Published On 24 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Brazil vs Serbia match preview,"With both teams heavily dependent on their attacks, a high-scoring affair is on the cards.",".Who: Brazil vs Serbia, Group G .Where: Lusail Stadium .When: Thursday, 10pm (19:00 GMT) .FIFA ranking: Brazil (1), Serbia (21) .Brazil and Serbia meet in the group stages of the World Cup for the second successive edition. A lot has changed for both teams since their clash in Moscow four years ago. .The evolution of Brazil’s squad is best evidenced by the fact that the opening goal in their 2-0 win over Serbia in 2018 was scored by Paulinho — who has not played for the national team in the last four years. Brazil’s midfield was run ragged by Belgium in the quarterfinal that year and the manner in which they were exposed kept manager Tite up at night. .Their midfield going into the current World Cup has been significantly shored up. In Fabinho, Bruno Guimarães and Lucas Paquetá – all of whom will be making their World Cup debuts in Qatar – Tite has found the perfect balance in the middle of the park. .Brazil was a team in transition in 2018, lacking a clear identity. The shadow of their humiliation in the 2014 World Cup they hosted – when they were thrashed 7-1 in front of their fans by Germany in the semi-finals – still hung over the team and the nation as a whole. .But, this time, there is a tangible enthusiasm around the squad of the perennial favourites that in large part has to do with the attacking talent at their disposal. .Neymar is playing arguably his best football at Paris Saint-Germain. Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli have been key to Arsenal’s resurgence this season. Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo are fresh off winning the Champions League with Real Madrid. Add to this Raphinha, Antony and Richarlison and this is a forward line made up of fire and flair in equal parts. . .The Seleção went unbeaten in their World Cup qualifiers, scoring 45 goals and conceding just five. .Like Brazil, Serbia too have undergone change since the last World Cup. The 2018 tournament in Russia was only their second-ever appearance in the World Cup. The squad was strewn with veterans evidently past their prime and youngsters lacking the experience of playing on such a global stage. Unsurprisingly, they crashed out in the group stages. .But the current side looks better equipped to handle the pressures of big tournament football. The old guard of Branislav Ivanović, Nemanja Matić and Aleksandar Kolarov have retired and the younger players who were a part of the 2018 squad have taken enormous strides in their development. .Aleksandar Mitrović broke the record for the most goals scored in an English season last year. He is currently one of the most feared strikers in the English Premier League. Filip Kostić played a starring role in Eintracht Frankfurt’s Europa League triumph last season and sealed a transfer to Juventus. .Lazio’s Sergej Milinković-Savić has consistently been one of the best midfielders in the Serie A. Serbian captain Dušan Tadić moved to Ajax after the 2018 World Cup and was a key member of their run to the Champions League semi-final in 2019. The emergence of striker Dušan Vlahović – reports suggest Real Madrid and Manchester United are among those eyeing him – furthers the potency of this Serbian attack. .Serbia topped their World Cup qualification group ahead of Portugal, scoring a phenomenal 18 goals across eight games. .Serbia and Brazil lean heavily on their attacks and possess chinks in their backlines. Serbia have kept just three clean sheets in their last 14 official games. Meanwhile Brazil’s squad is lacking in the wing-back positions: Danilo, Alex Telles, Alex Sandro and Dani Alves do not inspire confidence. Their attack-minded nature could be exploited by Serbia’s pacy wingers. .Brazil enter the World Cup in stellar form and are yet to lose a game since the Copa America final loss to Argentina last year. They have scored a staggering 18 goals in their last five games. Serbia has won four of its last five games, scoring 14 goals in them. .All of which points to one thing: On Thursday, expect a high-scoring affair.",431
432,Published On 24 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Portugal v Ghana match preview,Ghana will be eager to put their best foot forward to stop Ronaldo’s Portugal from winning a third trophy in six years.,".Who: Portugal vs Ghana, Group H .Where: Stadium 974 .When: Thursday, November 24, 7pm (16:00GMT) .FIFA ranking: Portugal (9), Ghana (61) .For all his off-the-pitch issues at Manchester United and the decline of his powers with age, 37-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo has remained one of the best to ever play this sport. .Portugal’s record goalscorer has had a bad season but will be keen to serve up a World Cup to remember, as this may be his swansong performance on a global stage. Never mind that he is fond of routinely silencing his critics, especially on big occasions. .Saudi Arabia’s defeat of Argentina, captained by archrival Lionel Messi, could also serve as a huge incentive for Ronaldo to propel his team as far as possible in this tournament, for the sake of his legacy and to get one over his rival. .A supporting cast of fellow veteran Pepe, AC Milan wonderkid Rafael Leão and a host of other stars including midfielders Vitinha and Bruno Fernandes will be on hand to help the team’s efforts towards winning a first-ever World Cup. .Fullback Joao Cancelo, who can play on both flanks and is known for his excellent delivery of crosses with the outside of his foot, will be behind them, looking to create magic from defence. .If they get as far as winning the trophy, it will be the third in a set of glorious outings in six years, after the European Championship (2016) and the Nations League (2019) trophies. .But first, they have to take on Ghana who they triumphed against 2-1 at the 2014 World Cup. .Star forward Mohammed Kudus of Ajax and defensive midfield linchpin Thomas Partey of Arsenal will spearhead the revenge mission, hoping to clip the wings of Ronaldo and company. .Despite being ranked 61 globally by FIFA, the Black Stars – as Ghana are known – have a reputation of springing surprises and repeatedly putting in good performances at FIFA age-grade competitions. .They will be eager to translate that youth success at this World Cup and advance to the quarterfinal as they did in 2010, or even beyond. .The Ghanaians secured qualification to Qatar 2022  – their fourth appearance – over rivals Nigeria due to the away goals rule, after a disastrous showing at the African Cup of Nations in January where they amassed only a single point in a group with Morocco, Gabon and the Comoros. .Fans will be hoping for a reversal of fortunes in the Middle East. .Their manager Otto Addo will be able to count on the experience of ex-Newcastle manager Chris Hughton in his backroom, to mount a decent challenge. .And if they can stifle what is on paper one of the most potent attacks in world football, they might also hope that they can overcome any barriers that Uruguay and South Korea – the other two sides in their group – pose in subsequent matches.",432
433,Published On 24 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Uruguay vs South Korea match preview,"Uruguay have some of world football’s biggest names, but South Korea have Son Heung-min.",".Who: Uruguay vs South Korea, Group H .Where: Education City Stadium .When: Thursday, November 24, at 4pm (13:00 GMT) .FIFA ranking: Uruguay (14), South Korea (28) .The opening game in Group H may be the one which resolves a question that’s on the minds of many: Who’s going to join Portugal from the group in moving into the round of 16? .The fourth team in the group, Ghana’s Black Stars, are ranked 61 in the world and aren’t favoured to make it out of the first round. And Cristiano Ronaldo will, barring some kind of natural disaster, be steering his Portuguese side into the knock-out stages in his fifth and likely final bid to lift the World Cup. .That means the remaining place is likely to be decided in a little over 90 minutes on Thursday. .This game might hinge on Edinson Cavani. The lean Valencia forward, formerly of Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain, is among the finest strikers of his generation, netting more than 200 club goals and 58 in an Uruguay shirt. .And Cavani is joined on Uruguay’s front line by Luis Suarez, who is always hungry for a bite of glory – when he isn’t chomping on opponents. All while Darwin Núñez of Liverpool will also be fighting for a place in coach Diego Alonso’s preferred two-striker formation. .Most of Uruguay’s national squad play outside of the country: 12 play in top European leagues. Nacional team-mates Suarez, defender Jose Luis Rodriguez and goalkeeper Sergio Rochet are the only players of Uruguay’s 26-man squad to play in Uruguay. .By contrast, 13 of South Korea’s players play in their country. The question is: Does individuals’ experience of top-quality European football count for more than the team cohesion achieved through a squad centred on a domestic league? .Son Heung-min, of South Korea and Tottenham, meanwhile, is a man who can be counted on to deliver for his country in big games. Exemptions from military service are offered to South Korean athletes who win gold at the Asian Games. Leading his team to the 2018 final, with the pressure on, Son provided both pinpoint goal-assists in South Korea’s 2-1 victory over Japan. .Nine from that 2018 Asian Games squad have joined captain Son in Qatar, including Olympiacos team-mates Hwang In-beom and Hwang Ui-jo. This is a team whose bonds stretch beyond any pitch. .For Uruguay, any result other than a win would be a disappointment. But South Korea, who knocked defending world champions Germany out of the 2010 World Cup, have shown they can cause an upset. And one team from Asia has already stunned a South American giant in this World Cup. Will there be a repeat on Thursday?",433
434,Published On 24 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Switzerland v Cameroon match preview,Switzerland’s Xhaka and Cameroon’s Chuopo-Moting weren’t always fan favourites. Now their teams depend on them.,".Who: Switzerland vs Cameroon, Group G .Where: Al Janoub Stadium .When: Thursday, November 24, 2022, at 1pm (10:00 GMT) .FIFA Ranking: Switzerland (15), Cameroon (43) .Redemption is the dominant theme in this opening fixture of Group G. .Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka has been one of the standout players in the Premier League this season for Arsenal. Positioned further up the pitch this season, he has already scored more goals this season (4) than he did in the previous three put together. Once a lightning rod of criticism for Arsenal fans, the midfield enforcer’s name is now routinely chanted by the fanbase. .Xhaka’s success in this advanced role shouldn’t come as a surprise, given he’s always operated there for Switzerland. In previous years, his performances for Switzerland have always been markedly better than those for his club. He was instrumental in their run to the quarterfinals of the Euro 2020 last year, where they famously defeated France in the Round of 16. .This time the Swiss fans will be hoping that Xhaka can carry his club form into the World Cup. Listen closely and you’ll hear the tables turning. . .But if there’s one player who could eclipse Xhaka’s redemption arc this season, it is possibly Cameroon’s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. .The 33-year-old forward has often been a figure of derision amongst fans who couldn’t understand how a player who was relegated with Stoke City in the Premier League, went on to play for European giants like Paris Saint-Germain and now Bayern Munich. .Chuopo-Moting’s role at both these clubs was often restricted to late substitute appearances. But at Bayern this season, he’s stepped out of the shadows to fill in the gap left by Robert Lewandowski’s departure over the summer. .He’s got 11 goals in all competitions, the joint second-highest with Sadio Mane for Bayern this season. In the Bundesliga this year, he currently averages more than a goal a game. .Once a punchline, Chuopo-Moting is now a protagonist in this Bayern team. He’ll be expected to reprise the same role for Cameroon in the World Cup. .“This is true that Eric is in the best shape of his career,” said Cameroon defender Jean-Charles Castelletto in an interview to SNTV. “He will be for sure an important player for Cameroon. We all need to get inspired by him to give us all the best that we can”. . .Switzerland and Cameroon too, have been on similar trajectories in the past year. .For starters, they both secured qualification to the World Cup in dramatic fashion. Switzerland held European champions Italy to a 1-1 draw in Rome in the penultimate qualification game in November last year, with Italian midfielder Jorginho missing a penalty in the 90th minute. They went on to beat Bulgaria in their final group game and finished ahead of Italy to qualify for the tournament. .Cameroon, too needed a late extra-time winner in their final qualification game against Algeria, which saw the Indomitable Lions seal the fifth and last spot for African teams at the World Cup. .They are both coming off strong showings in their most recent major tournament appearance. Switzerland reached the Euro 2020 quarter-finals for the first time in their history last year and came agonisingly close to making in into the semi-finals, losing to Spain on penalties. .Cameroon reached the semi-finals of the African Cup of Nations earlier this year, where they were knocked out by Egypt on penalties. .Interestingly, the two sides have never played each other before. Now they’ll met on the biggest stage of all.",434
435,Published On 24 Nov 2022,Ronaldo vs Messi: The numbers compared,Al Jazeera looks back at the careers of two of the most renowned footballers of their generation.,".Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will be playing their fifth, and probably last, World Cup in Qatar. .Argentina and Paris Saint-Germain player Messi, 35, announced in October that World Cup 2022 will be his last, while the 37-year-old Portugal and Manchester United player Ronaldo has yet to comment on his international future. .For more than a decade now, the football world has debated who is better. The discussion is likely to continue long after they hang up their boots. .As the two giants of the game reach the twilight of their careers, we take a look at their performances over more than 17 years of playing football at the highest level. .Ronaldo has played 191 international matches compared with Messi’s 164, prior to Argentina’s World Cup opener against Saudi Arabia. .The former Real Madrid star’s international career began in 2003, while Messi, who left Barcelona last year for Paris, played his first international game two years later against Hungary. .When it comes to their scoring record, Ronaldo is far ahead of his Argentinian rival. .The Manchester United star has scored 117 times, a record. Messi has 90 goals to his name. .Both players have one major regional competition at international level, with Ronaldo winning the European Championship in 2016 and Messi clinching the Copa America in 2021. .At football’s most prestigious event, Messi has played 19 matches, two more than his Portugese competitor. .Ronaldo again leads in the goal-scoring department with seven goals, one more than Messi. .However, between the two, only Messi has reached a World Cup final, at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The South American football giants lost to Germany in extra time 1-0. .There was some consolation for Messi as he took home the Golden Ball for the best performance at the World Cup in Brazil. In contrast, Ronaldo has reached the semi-final stage once, in 2006. . .Ronaldo has scored 701 goals at all club competitions while Messi has 695 – making them the leading goal scorers at club level in football history. .But the Portuguese has played 100 more games than Messi, giving the latter a better game per goal average. .However, when it comes to assists, the 35-year-old Argentinian far outnumbers Ronaldo, with nearly 50 percent more than the Manchester United player.",435

Despite his hard work, the end product was not goals. .While the encounter was low on action, it was at least high on intensity as both sides battled for midfield supremacy much to the delight of the loud supporters of the Atlas Lions. The Moroccan fans were in good spirits after the game despite the draw. .“I wanted a win badly,” Morocco fan Mohammaed El Yamiq, 42, from Mohammadiya near Casablanca, told Al Jazeera. .“It was very much a boring game … but this will do for now. It is a good booster for us when we play with others in the group,” he said. .Croatia’s Modric said after the match that it was “a tough game, especially in the first 15 minutes”, adding that his team had faired better in the second half. .Croatia will now turn their attention to their game against Canada on Sunday when Morocco will face Belgium. .Germany vs Japan .Germany against Japan got underway at 4pm (13:00 GMT) at Khalifa International Stadium and few could have expected what was about to unfold. .Japan created the second earthquake at the Qatar World Cup 2022 when they came from behind to deliver a stunning 2-1 win over the Germans. .Mirroring Argentina in their shock 2-1 loss against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday after being ahead by a goal, Germany had been in the lead following a first-half penalty by Ilkay Gundogan. .Several German chances then went unfulfilled and poor defending helped the Japanese to regain their composure and come roaring back. .With one goal down, the Japanese appeared to change their tactics and became more aggressive in the German half, taking the initiatives when the German’s tried to hold on to their lead. .But it was Ritsu Doan in the 75th minute and Takuma Asano in the 83rd whose goals gave Japan their biggest World Cup win to date. .“This is a huge disappointment and frustrating,” Germany’s Captain Manuel Neuer told broadcaster ARD after the game. “We made the opponent strong. The final desire made the difference. Japan believed they could win while we thought we could preserve the lead,” he said. .German coach Hansi Flick said: “It is brutally disappointing. We are annoyed we lost the game because we had the chances. We have to look forward. We have the chance for six points.” .Japan’s Maya Yoshida told BeIN Sports: “This is the beauty of football, sometimes it happens! Now the spotlight is on our side, it’s time to dance.” .Japan’s Coach Hajime Moriyasu said: “We knew that we had to defend better. That’s why I changed the system. The players knew immediately what I meant and how they should react.” .“We have celebrated a great victory but it continues. We will prepare as well for the next game,” Moriyasu said, looking ahead at Sunday’s game with Costa Rica. .With the loss, Germany likely now fear an early exit from the tournament. .“We have created history today!” Japan fan Kosuke told Al Jazeera, as fellow supporters exited Khalifa International Stadium waving flags. .Kosuke said he did not expect his team to beat Germany but now there was no stopping the Samurai Blue. .“They will be losing their heads back home, and maybe they will get a day off tomorrow, just like Saudi Arabia,” Kosuke said with a grin on his face. .Spain vs Costa Rica .The Spanish and Costa Ricans got their game underway at 7pm (16:00 GMT) at Al Thumama Stadium and it was a match of more firsts for the World Cup. .Not since Pelé in 1958 had someone as young as Spain’s Gavi scored a goal at the World Cup. The 18-year-old midfielder led the way on Wednesday as Spain pulled off the biggest World Cup victory in its history, delivering a 7-0 thrashing to Costa Rica. .With Gavi and 19-year-old Pedri starting in the match, Spain also became the first European nation with two teenagers in the line-up of a World Cup match in 60 years .“I could never have imagined it,” said Gavi, who was named the game’s most valuable player. “I know I’m the youngest in the team and I respect everyone, but on the field it’s different and I bring out my best,” he said. .Spain’s young squad avoided any chance of an upset with Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio and Ferran Torres scoring a goal each in the first half. Torres, Gavi, Carlos Soler and Álvaro Morata added to the tally in the second half. .Olmo’s goal was the 100th at World Cups for Spain, which became the sixth nation to score more than 100 times in the tournament’s history. It was also the first time Spain scored seven goals in a World Cup match and the first time a team completed 1,000 passes in a 90-minute game at the tournament, according to match statistics from the Opta Sports analytics platform. .Costa Rica looked overwhelmed throughout the game, failing to even get a single attempt scoring a goal. The team came to Qatar hoping to repeat their surprise run to the quarterfinals in 2014 in Brazil and avoid a repeat of their winless showing four years ago at the World Cup in Russia. .“We didn’t hold on to the possession as we should have done it,” Costa Rica coach Luis Fernando Suárez said after the match. “We couldn’t complete three or four passes.” .Only five countries have scored more goals than Spain at the World Cup – Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy and France. .Belgium vs Canada .The Belgian and Canadian sides squared off at 10pm (19:00 GMT) at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium where Canada outplayed Belgium on the pitch but did not win the match. .Canada lost 1-0 to the Belgian side who weathered a fierce Canadian storm of football prowess to put away a goal and take the game. .Against the world’s second-ranked side, Canada were unlucky to come away empty handed. Belgium managed only nine attempts at a goal while Canada had 21. .Canada failed to capitalise on several scoring opportunities but still stood up to their mighty opponents by preventing them from settling into the match. .Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saved a penalty early in the first half and teammate Michy Batshuayi scored on the stroke of halftime to give Belgium the win. .“They showed tonight that they do belong here,” Canada’s Manager John Herdman said of his team’s performance after the match. .“With a performance like this, I said to the players” ‘we just get on to the next task.’ I’m proud of what they did, really proud. They proved they can play here,” he said. .With their win, Belgium now lead Group F with 3 points. .Herdman said that he expects Canada’s performance against the Belgians will earn his team a little more respect from future opponents. .“Teams will know what we do and how we go about our business. The effort was unreal. If we can be more ruthless in that attack, we will get something out of these games. The group is wide open,” he said. .Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said after the game that the team had been second-best on the pitch but hailed the win as an important foundation on which Belgium could build its tournament campaign. .Canada’s come up next against Croatia on Sunday and Belgium is set to take on Morocco on the same day. .German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, who is also responsible for sports, wore a “One Love” armband in the stands at Germany’s game on Wednesday, where she was sitting beside FIFA President Gianni Infantino. .Faeser posted a photo of herself on Twitter wearing the band with the hashtag #OneLove. .News agency DPA reported that Faeser had the armband on under a pink blazer, which she took off during the first half. . .“In today’s times, it is incomprehensible that FIFA does not want people to openly stand for tolerance and against discrimination. It does not fit in our times and it is not appropriate towards people,” Faeser said during a visit to a German Football Association event in Doha before the game. .Germany’s players also covered their mouths during a team photo ahead of their World Cup opener against Japan on Wednesday in protest at FIFA’s threat to sanction players for wearing the “OneLove” armband. .The gesture, which took place in front of dozens of photographers, came after the world football body had threatened to sanction players for wearing the rainbow-coloured armbands. .The captains of seven European teams had planned to wear the armbands as part of an anti-discrimination campaign, but the footballers backed down after the threat of disciplinary action.",436
437,Published On 24 Nov 2022,Japan fans win praise for stadium cleaning at World Cup 2022,Japan’s football fans are earning respect for their tradition of staying behind to help clean stadiums after World Cup games.,".Doha, Qatar – Japan’s stunning victory over Germany left their football fans in a state of joyous disbelief on Wednesday. .Now, supporters of the Samurai Blue are earning praise in Qatar for an off-pitch tradition that appears to be uniquely Japanese: Cleaning up stadiums after other football fans have left. .In what is becoming an increasingly common sight, Japanese fans stayed behind after their team’s win over Germany on Wednesday and helped to clean up the Khalifa International Stadium. .As soon as the stadium started to empty, Japanese supporters could be seen taking out light blue disposable rubbish bags and getting to work. .While the sight of spectators staying back to clean up may be a surprise to many, for the Japanese it is not out of the ordinary. .“What you think is special is actually nothing unusual for us,” Danno, a Japanese fan, told Al Jazeera with a casual shrug. .Danno does not understand why people think the gesture is odd. . .  .“When we use the toilet, we clean it ourselves. When we leave a room, we make sure it’s tidy. That’s the custom,” he explained. .“We can’t leave a place without making it clean. It’s a part of our education, everyday learning.” .Social media posts featuring Japanese football fans with rubbish bags started doing the rounds in the days following the opening game of the tournament, between Qatar and Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium on Sunday. . .In one post, a man is expressing his shock at a Japanese fan cleaning inside the Al Bayt Stadium long after most spectators had left and in a match that did not feature the Japanese side. .Samurai Blue’s supporters have been cleaning up football stadiums for a while; even a defeat does not detract them from this important post-match task. .During the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Japan lost their round-of-16 match against Belgium with an injury-time goal. Japanese fans were heartbroken but that did not detract them from getting out their disposable rubbish bag and going to work. .Saysuka, who spoke to Al Jazeera ahead of the match against Germany, said she is aware people are taking notice of their tradition but noted the fans are not doing it for publicity. .“Cleanliness and tidiness is like religion to us in Japan and we treasure it,” she said, before opening her backpack to show a pack of rubbish bags she will use and distribute to others after the match. . .  .While social media videos of the stadium-cleaning Japanese may be relatively new, tidiness and organisation have deep roots in Japanese culture. These characteristics are gaining a worldwide following through books and television shows. .Japanese organising consultant Marie Kondo is now a global household name thanks to her books and a popular Netflix series on the topic. .Takshi, a Japanese football supporter who lives in the United States but grew up in Japan, says he learned the tradition of tidiness as a child. .“We had to clean our rooms, our bathrooms, our classrooms, and then as we grow up, it becomes a part of our lives,” he said. .After Japan’s victory over Germany, Takshi and his 13-year-old son Kayde stayed behind with their fellow supporter. .With Japan now having three points on the table and two more group matches to go, fans and spectators can expect to be treated to more Japanese aesthetics, on and off the football pitch.",437

In their only other World Cup appearance in Mexico in 1986, Canada lost all three matches and failed to hit the back of the net once. .Undeterred by the early setback, the Canadian attack continued to press throughout the first 45 minutes, with their speed creating havoc in the Belgian defence and keeping Courtois busy. .But against the run of play, Belgium took the lead when Batshuayi broke between two defenders, ran on to a long ball and shot past goalkeeper Milan Borjan just before the break. .Batshuayi was only playing because of first-choice striker Romelu Lukaku’s injury, which could have him missing the entire group stage. .The second half was more even, with both sides creating chances to score. .But overall, Canada had 21 shots at goal compared to the nine registered by Belgium, whose well-established, star-studded team was far from convincing. .There were six players in their 30s in the starting lineup, four of them having accrued more than 100 international appearances. .Courtois and key midfielder Kevin De Bruyne might also reach three figures at this World Cup, in what increasingly looks like the last hurrah for this group, who have often been described as a “golden generation” of Belgian footballers. .Coach Roberto Martinez admitted after the game that his side had been second-best across the board but hailed the victory as an important foundation on which Belgium could build its tournament campaign. .Indeed, all the best moves came from a mobile and attacking Canadian team in front of their loud, maple leaf-waving fans. They had 14 shots in the first half alone – the most in 16 years by a team at the World Cup that failed to score. . .Davies stood out with his driving runs from left back while captain Atiba Hutchinson, at the age of 39, became the oldest outfield player to start a World Cup match. .But their failure to convert the slew of chances they generated leaves them bottom of Group F, propping up Morocco and Croatia, who have one point apiece, and first-placed Belgium. .Canada’s next outing will see them come up against Croatia on Sunday, with Belgium set to take on Morocco on the same day. A win for Martinez’s charges would guarantee their passage through to the knockout phase.",439

The patient Japanese were waiting to see if an offside would be called. .Then, after the goal stood, it was bedlam. .“I was jumping. I was screaming. I fell and hurt myself, but I don’t care,” Kayde, a 13-year-old Japanese fan, told Al Jazeera outside the stadium after the match ended. .Japan came from a goal down to beat Germany 2-1 in the first game of Group E in Doha on Wednesday, following in the footsteps of Saudi Arabia’s shock win over Argentina with the same scoreline on Tuesday. .Germany had taken the lead in the 33rd minute when İlkay Gündoğan netted a penalty to cap a dominant performance. But they then failed to convert several chances and were made to pay by two second-half goals in the space of eight minutes from Ritsu Doan (75′) and Asano (83′). .Kayde and his father Takashi flew into Qatar from the United States to support the national team of their country of birth. .“It was unbelievable. When Japan scored the first goal, we were anxious because the Germans always come back stronger – but they didn’t,” said Takashi. .His anxiety didn’t end there. “When added time was shown on the screen, I set a timer on my phone and kept staring at it until the referee blew his whistle.” .Another Japan fan, Knichi, who has travelled to Qatar on his own, said he needed a moment to take in what had just occurred. .“Maybe I will go to the FIFA Fan Festival and find some Japanese fans to celebrate with, but I need a breather. My heart is going up and down,” he said, his hands moving in a wave. .Japan made its World Cup debut in 1998 but was unable to go past the first round. It crossed that hurdle when it co-hosted the tournament with South Korea in 2002, and then again in 2010 and 2018. .The overriding feeling among the fans of the Blue Samurai was that of disbelief, and Knichi said the win against the 2014 world champions will go down as Japan’s best in the tournament’s history. .“If you asked me for a prediction before the match, I would have said Japan will lose. At best, a draw. A win? Not happening.” .Kosuke, another Japanese, said his compatriots back home would be up all night. .“They will be watching, partying and then waiting for tomorrow to be announced as a day off, just like Saudi Arabia,” he said in a nod to the Saudi government’s decision to declare Wednesday a public holiday after their upset win over Argentina. .The Japanese fans who travelled to Qatar from their home country and other parts of the world got their money’s worth on Wednesday, and now cannot wait for Japan’s next game against Costa Rica on Sunday. .Germany, meanwhile, will face Spain, who later on Wednesday thumped Costa Rica 7-0. .The defeat to Japan brought painful flashbacks of their last World Cup campaign four years ago in Russia, when they did not make it past the first round. .“Everything that could go wrong, went wrong for us,” Thomas, a German fan, told Al Jazeera, as more of his fellow fans trudged off in silence with drooped shoulders and flags folded away.",440

It does not fit in our times and it is not appropriate towards people,” Faeser said during a visit to a German Football Association event in Doha before the game. .Fans should also be allowed to “openly” show pro-LGBTQ symbols, Faeser told reporters, adding that supporters should “make a decision for themselves” about whether they wanted to wear them. .The criminalisation of same-sex relations in Qatar, the tournament’s host country, has been a long-running controversy in the build-up to the World Cup. .Qatar has repeatedly stated that everyone is welcome to attend the tournament. The government has also accused critics of “double standards” and of engaging in an “unprecedented campaign” unlike that faced by any other host country. .Moments after the team photo, the German Football Association tweeted it with the message: “It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. .“Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position.” . .German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said earlier in the day in Berlin that FIFA’s decision to bar captains from wearing the armbands was “very unfortunate”. .“The rights of LGBTQ people are non-negotiable,” Hebestreit told a press conference. .Security staff at the World Cup have ordered spectators to remove items of clothing featuring rainbow logos. .Underlining tensions at the tournament over the issue, Belgium player Jan Vertonghen said on Tuesday that he was “afraid” to talk about human rights. .Vertonghen, speaking on the eve of Belgium’s opening game against Canada later on Wednesday, said he did not feel comfortable. .“I’m afraid if I say something about this I might not be able to play tomorrow,” the defender said. .“It’s an experience I’ve never felt in football before. I feel controlled. I’m afraid to even say something about this. .“We’re just saying normal things about racism and discrimination and if you can’t even say things about it, that says it all. .“I want to appear on the pitch tomorrow, so I’ll leave it at that.”",442

444,Published On 23 Nov 2022,"World Cup 2022: For Canada, history is one goal away",Canada failed to score in its one and only World Cup appearance in 1986; a young team hopes to change that in Qatar.,".Montreal, Canada – All Canada needs to make history in Qatar is a goal. .This is the second time the Canadian national men’s football team has reached the sport’s biggest event, after its first and only appearance at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. .But the squad failed to score a single goal in its three games – all losses – during the opening round of that tournament 36 years ago, setting the stage for what could be an historic moment at Qatar 2022. .They just need to find the back of the net. .“The first go around in 1986 was probably less than glorious,” said Alan McDougall, a history professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and author of Contested Fields: A Global History of Modern Football. .“But Canada’s soccer has made a lot of progress since then, and I think there are good grounds for optimism that the 2022 team will fare better than its 1986 predecessor,” he told Al Jazeera. .“There’s no doubt the 2022 team has a chance to rewrite some historical wrongs.” .Canada faces a first gargantuan hurdle on Wednesday when it takes on Belgium – the number-two ranked team in the world – in its first match of the competition at Al-Rayyan Stadium. .The two countries have gone up against each other only once before, with Belgium coming out on top 2-0 in an international friendly in Ottawa in 1989. .This time, the 41st-ranked Canadian side will be betting on a boost from Alphonso Davies, its 22-year-old superstar who recently sustained a hamstring injury while playing with his Bundesliga team, Bayern Munich. .Davies told Canadian channel TSN on Sunday that getting hurt just weeks before the start of the World Cup was “devastating” for the team and for himself, “but luckily it wasn’t too bad of an injury” and he expects to be on the field against Belgium. .“I think I can start the first game, and play the first game,” said the winger. “They wouldn’t put me on the pitch if it was 50/50.” .Les Jones, the former chairman of the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame, said Canada’s “motto is fear nothing, and it’s proved appropriate in the past because they’ve beaten teams they didn’t expect to beat”. .According to Jones, Canada has “already exceeded all expectations” by reaching the 2022 World Cup. Now, the focus is on succeeding in the group stage, where Canada faces not only Belgium but also Croatia and Morocco. .“Some people are hoping for a goal, some are hoping for a point, some are hoping for a win,” Jones said. “But I think [coach] John Herdman and the team are aiming to qualify” for the knock-out stage, the next step in the competition. .Jones sees reason to be optimistic, given the surprise upsets in the World Cup so far. “If you look at [Tuesday’s] results, the underdogs are doing well: Saudi Arabia beat Argentina and Tunisia got a draw with Denmark,” he told Al Jazeera. .Even at the 1986 World Cup, Canada did better than predicted by keeping the game scoreless against France until the 78th minute, Jones said. Les Bleus eventually won 1-0. .“There were many people who expected [France] to score double figures,” Jones explained. “So we’ve surprised before and hopefully we can surprise again.” . .Meanwhile, most experts say the odds of Canada getting that elusive first World Cup goal are high. .“I’m pretty confident,” Jeffrey Rosenthal, a statistics professor at the University of Toronto, recently told U of T News, explaining that the team has scored at least once in seven of its last 10 games .“By that measure, the probability of failing to score at least one goal in all three of their upcoming group matches is only 2.7 percent, which means they are 97.3 percent certain to score at least once,” Rosenthal said. .“Now, some of their group opponents might be stronger than their previous adversaries, so this calculation isn’t totally fair. But I would still give them more than an 80 percent chance of scoring at least one goal.” .It remains to be seen now which player will put the ball past a goalkeeper – and when. .The first opportunity will come against Belgium on Wednesday, followed by games versus Croatia on November 27 and Morocco on December 1. .“If I was putting money on it, I would probably go with Jonathan David [to score the first goal for Canada],” said McDougall. “He plays up front and he’s the player the team has relied on mostly for goals,” he said. .“I think in terms of raising Canada’s profile, a screamer from their most globally famous player, Alphonso Davies, would be the most dramatic way of announcing Canada’s arrival in the World Cup.” .",444

446,Published On 23 Nov 2022,"When they came, a Qatar World Cup was unthinkable. Now it’s here","How Qatar has changed, seen through the eyes of the expats living there since before it won the right to host the World Cup.",".Doha, Qatar – Shehar Bano Rizvi moved from the bubbling, ever-expanding metropolis of Karachi to a calmer Doha soon after her marriage in 2004. .The then-23-year-old Pakistani expat was not impressed when she arrived in the Qatari capital, thinking she had landed in the middle of a desert in more ways than one. The streets were empty and the shopping options scarce. A solitary five-star hotel, a basic mall and a smattering of office buildings stood in West Bay. .“My husband had a very basic driving rule for me: if you get lost, follow the directions to the Corniche [waterfront promenade] and you will be able to navigate your way home,” Rizvi said, recalling her first experiences getting around Doha at a time when apps were unheard of. .Fast-forward 18 years and West Bay is buzzing. It is Doha’s prime business district and home to an ever-busier skyline populated by more and more skyscrapers. Shiny new buildings along the shores of the Gulf bask in the sun all day and put on a glittering light show at night. .Doha’s metamorphosis extends beyond here though, with new districts, cultural hubs and state-of-the-art venues having transformed the cityscape. .Human rights organisations and media reports have said Qatar’s development has come at the cost of labour rights. Concerns about low wages, poor living conditions and worker safety have been consistently raised by rights groups and critics of the Gulf nation hosting the World Cup. .Hitting back, Qatari officials point to recent reforms to labour laws, including a universal minimum wage and an easing of restrictions on foreign workers who want to change employers. Officials have also criticised Western media for what they call biased and inaccurate coverage of Qatar and its preparations for the tournament. .Qatar, an energy-rich country that declared independence only five decades ago, won the right to host the World Cup in 2010. Its transformation has also coincided with a rapid increase in its population – currently, nearly three million people – the vast majority of whom are migrant workers, mostly from South Asian countries. .“Qatar’s independence was in 1971, so we ha[d] certain policies that do not fit now,” Faisal al-Mudakha, editor-in-chief of the Gulf Times, told Al Jazeera. .“Now we have the World Cup,” he said. “We are talking about 12 years of reform of policy … [that is being] done because of the World Cup – but it [has been] fast-forwarded. And I think after the World Cup, it will also continue based on needs and to meet international law.” .Six-lane highways, a sparkly-clean metro train system and commuter buses that now form Qatar’s transport hub were a distant dream in the early 2000s, when the thought of a tiny country like Qatar hosting a football World Cup was beyond imagining. .“I remember attending the opening ceremony of the 2006 Asian Games in disbelief that a country of Qatar’s size could host such a big event,” said Rizvi, a photographer and an author of a book on Pakistani cuisine. .“On that cold, rainy December night at the brand new Khalifa International Stadium, it became clear that Qatar was shifting its focus towards sports, culture and education.” .The country formalised that change in the following years under its National Vision 2030, an ambitious development plan aimed at diversifying its economy, slashing its carbon footprint and achieving social progress. .Sports are a key pillar of that vision. Since 2012, Qatar has celebrated an annual sports day every February. The occasion is marked as a public holiday, allowing residents to participate in sports and fitness-related activities. .Back then, according to Rizvi, the number of women and girls in sports was negligible. .“My daughter took up football as a child but left it after a while because there were no all-girls teams,” she said. “But now, as a teenager, she plays in an academy that has brought her international exposure and given her a chance to meet her football idols. .“And it’s not just her, so many Qatari female teenagers turn up to practice sessions and games with their fathers, who seem genuinely proud and can be seen cheering them on from the sidelines.” .However, there has been lackadaisical progress in women’s football on the bigger stage. The Qatari women’s football team has not played a competitive match in a few years and has dropped out from FIFA’s rankings, while many teenagers and young women stop playing as they get older. .Despite the gradual growth on the football pitch, women have been at the forefront of educational and cultural progress in the country. .Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, the second wife of former Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, was pivotal in establishing Qatar’s Education City in 2003, where several renowned international universities have set up local campuses. .Sheikha Mayassa bint Hamad, the current emir’s sister, heads the arts and culture scene in the form of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA). .The organisation has established several museums across the country that focus on Arab and Islamic art, Qatar’s national history, sports and an interactive children’s museum which is set to open soon. .The cultural centres have become a popular leisure option for many who, for years, had few entertainment alternatives. .“It was very basic,” Eeman Abed, a Palestinian who has been living in Qatar for more than 20 years, said. “Go to the park, have a walk at the Corniche or eat out at the weekend,” she added with a shrug. .But as the country moved forward and Doha grew to a thriving hub of arts and culture, Abed added, it took many of its expats along. .“We used to live in a small house in old Doha and after moving across the city over time, we have now settled in The Pearl,” she said, referring to the upmarket artificial island with Mediterranean-inspired housing and beaches. .That’s where Rizvi lived with her husband, who works for Qatar Stock Exchange, when the country won World Cup hosting rights. .Rizvi remembers a festive night as people came out with their maroon and white Qatari flags and national songs thundered out of cars. .“It wasn’t just about Qatar,” she says. “It was about an Arab Muslim nation hosting the world’s biggest event and that is exactly what the West is unable to fathom,” she adds, referring to the ongoing criticism that Qatar has faced since that night in December 2010. .But with the event now under way, every part of Doha’s tourist hotspots has been filled up by international fans – from the West and beyond. They are trying on local food and fashion, indulging in banter with local fans, and bringing their festivities to the Gulf shores.",446

Let’s support them till the end.” .The Moroccans went into the game very much the underdogs, but highly rated Croatia and their star player Luka Modric were unable to get past their defence to score. .By the end, it was clear that the Moroccan fans’ belief in their team had lifted to a level where they felt a surprise win was possible. .The fans were largely subdued after the final whistle, except for the jeers when Modric was announced player of the match. .“I wanted a win badly,” said Mohammed El Yamiq, 42, from the western Moroccan city of Mohammedia. “… It was very much a boring game, … but this will do for now. It is a good booster for us when we play others in the group.” .The stadium in Al Khor, Qatar, was filled with colour and excitement. It was a sea of red and green, the shades of the Moroccan flag. .The Croatian fans were certainly in far fewer numbers than their Moroccan counterparts. .Frank Kanajet, who is from the southwestern city of Split, felt his Croatian team had the better chances. “As finalists of the 2018 World Cup, there was an obligation for us to win, ” the 60-year-old said. .But his son Andre was less surprised and said the result was “expected”. .“Morocco is a strong team,” said the 38-year-old, who lives in Abu Dhabi. “… It was more or less evenly matched.” .Another Croatian fan named Josep said he would have “felt more easy” with a win because he believes Belgium and Canada, the other two teams in Group C, will prove tougher opponents than Morocco. .Croatia plays next on Sunday against Canada, and Morocco take on Belgium on the same day.",447

And as kickoff approached, the atmosphere in the stands reached a fever pitch. .However, the fans would fail to inspire action on the pitch in a game where chances were at a premium and ended in the third goalless draw in nine games at the World Cup so far. .There were glimpses of a potential goal for both sides, with Nikola Vlasic going close for Croatia at the end of the first half while Noussair Mazraoui had a header saved for Morocco. .Croatia’s best moments predictably hinged on Luka Modric, who was given free run, floating effortlessly from back to front, with football’s traditional midfield roles seeming not to apply to the captain. .One minute he was patrolling in front of his back four, the next hanging off the shoulder of Andrej Kramaric up front, but always looking to open up the North Africans, whether he was hovering at right-back or hunting further forward. .Morocco looked principally to Hakim Ziyech for inspiration. The Chelsea winger, who was recalled to the squad following the recent appointment of coach Walid Regragui, was their most dangerous attacking outlet in the early stages. However, his good work lacked an end product. .While the encounter was low on action, it was at least high on intensity as both sides battled for midfield supremacy. Still, the first half ended with neither goal really threatened until the closing moments when Yassine Bounou saved Vlasic’s low effort. .There was more action in the first five minutes of the second half when Morocco had raucous appeals for a penalty waved away after Sofiane Boufal’s shot appeared to hit Dejan Lovren’s arm, seconds before Mazraoui’s header was saved by Dominik Livakovic. .Moments later, Lovren’s effort on the slide at the other end was blocked by Sofyan Amrabat, but that was about as good as it got for Croatia until centre-back Josko Gvardiol’s header went wide in the 80th minute. .Despite the draw, Moroccan fans were in good spirits after the game, even if they lost some energy in the last minutes and made a lot of noise when the whistle blew. .Many remained in the 60,000-capacity Al Bayt Stadium and continued to chant Ole Ole Ole Ole and Hayya Hayya. Modric, who was just announced man of the match on the big screen, received a huge jeer from the Moroccans, as he did for most of the game. .“I wanted a win badly,” Morocco fan Mohammaed El Yamiq, 42, from Mohammadiya near Casablanca, told Al Jazeera. .“It was very much a boring game … but this will do for now. It is a good booster for us when we play with others in the group,” .Croatia will now turn their attention to their game against Canada on Sunday when Morocco will face Belgium.",450

Moroccans rushed to take pictures with them while some held Palestine flags alongside the Moroccan one. .Nabeela from Rabat, and a Qatar resident, said she was “super proud” of her team making it to the World Cup. “I am very confident we will do well today,” said the 31-year-old who works in an energy company. .But regional camaraderie was also on display. Nabeela said she was “so happy for the Saudis”, and that their stunning upset against Argentina on Tuesday “will boost the confidence of our team as well”. .On Tuesday, Tunisia too surprised Denmark by holding them to a goalless draw. .Meanwhile, the Croatian fans were in outnumbered Some were in custom-made white thobes decorated with red squares reminiscent of their national flag – perhaps their way to match and celebrate the occasion of the World Cup being held in an Arab country for the first time. .One couple Al Jazeera spoke to said they are having a “great time” in Qatar. .Maya, 56, and Davor, 61, said they have been living on a cruise ship that is docked at Doha. .“The security, hospitality … and transportation has been perfect,” Davor said. This tournament is their first time in the Middle East. .“I think it’s wonderful the World Cup is here in this region,” Maya said. “It is good for cultural exchange. People will be interested in travelling to other countries in the Gulf.” .Asked who will win today, Davor smiled saying he doesn’t want to “jinx it”. Then he opened up. “I think Croatia … it has a better team on paper.” .Meanwhile, al-Motakki said he is confident his team will be the victors. “It will be 2-1 … another upset.”",451

It also confirmed that his condition is stable. .AlShahrani left Qatar on Wednesday morning for Riyadh to undergo surgery at the National Guard Hospital. .The 30-year-old was initially taken straight to Hamad Medical City in Doha where he underwent a full medical check-up and spent last night. .AlShahrani was injured following a collision with Saudi’s goalkeeper Mohammed AlOwais’ knee during the second-half stoppage time at the Lusail Stadium. AlOwais was seen dropping to his knees in shock over the incident. .AlShahrani initially tried to get to his feet but looked dazed as blood streamed from his nose. He was later stretchered off after a lengthy delay. .The 30-year-old Al-Hilal player had given a heroic performance and largely kept the star-studded Argentinian team from producing any real chances in the second half. .The match will go down as one of the biggest upsets in international football as Saudi Arabia became the first Asian team to beat Argentina at a World Cup.",452
453,Published On 23 Nov 2022,"For some fans, World Cup alcohol ban brings relief","FIFA’s decision sparked criticism from some visitors, but many Qatar-based fans – including families – back the move.",".Doha, Qatar – Abdulla Murad Ali put his hands on his heart and said his country welcomes everyone coming for the World Cup. .The Qatari banker wants football fans to treat the event’s host nation as their second home. His only request? They should also respect its culture. .“Qatar is an Islamic country, and alcohol is ‘haram’ [forbidden] in our religion. All we ask is for the world to show some ‘ehtaram’ (respect) for our culture,” he told Al Jazeera on Monday, a day after the opening match of the tournament. .Ali was referring to the furore among some fans about FIFA’s decision last Friday to ban alcohol at tournament venues. Liquor will still be available at selected hotels, bars and the official FIFA Fan Zone. .Nevertheless, the decision by international football’s governing authority has been criticised by some fans for its timing. In the lead-up to England’s first game of the tournament against Iran on Monday, a few disgruntled fans were seen complaining about a lack of understanding for their “drinking culture”. .Some were seen asking mall security, much to the latter’s bemusement, for directions to a place where they could find an alcoholic drink. A few fans that Al Jazeera spoke to on Friday said they feel like they have been misled by FIFA. .“If FIFA were to ban alcohol when Qatar was announced the host, it would have been different,” Federico Farraz, a football fan from Portugal, said while drinking a cup of tea in Doha’s Souq Waqif. “Even if the decision came a few months before the tournament, people who have been planning for this trip for years would have understood.” .But for others, the decision — which FIFA said followed discussions with the host nation — came as a relief. .Sonia Nemmas is a Jordanian mother of three girls raised in a football-mad household. The family has tickets to a late-night match and is apprehensive about being at a stadium where drunk fans could potentially be in attendance. .“When we go to other countries, we don’t ask them why we are being asked to follow their rules or respect their culture,” she said with a shrug. “We just do it.” On Friday evening, the weekend in Qatar, she was out in Doha’s downtown area to participate in festivities. .Her daughters were with her, wearing the keffiyeh in a nod to their Jordanian identity, while showing their support for Qatar by carrying the host country’s flags and hats. .Nemmas referred to the alcohol-fuelled violence that broke out at Wembley Stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championship in England last year. It is not something she wants to see in Qatar. .While some England fans have voiced their unhappiness with the ban on social media and in public, others said it wouldn’t stop them from having a good time. .Ahmed Muhammad, a Doha-based school teacher from England, said it was unfair to paint all English fans with the same brush. “England fans are generally shown to be hooligans but that is just a small minority,” he said while soaking in the atmosphere at Souq Waqif with his young son. “The majority are respectful and do follow the rules.” .Muhammed said that while there will be some unhappy English fans, most would respect the decision and enjoy themselves. .That should not be hard at all, suggested Ali, the Qatari banker, who attended the opening ceremony and Sunday’s Qatar-Ecuador game. After all, he pointed out, people who live in and follow football in Muslim countries do it without alcohol all the time. .“Being a Muslim country, this what we want people to understand — that you can enjoy the game without a beer in hand,” he said. “Football is for everyone, not just for people who want to drink beer.”",453

Head to head: Croatia 7-6 Morocco (penalties) .This is the first encounter between Morocco and Croatia at a World Cup. .The teams met once before in December 1996 in a friendly Hasan II Trophy tournament in Casablanca. .The game ended 7-6 in favour of the Croatians on penalties. It also saw three red cards handed out. .Ranked 22nd, Morocco, led by Chelsea midfielder Hakim Ziyech, head into this competition on a five-match unbeaten streak. However, the last time the Atlas Lions won a World Cup match was in 1998, a 3-0 win over Scotland. .And in spite of this being their sixth appearance at a World Cup, Morocco last progressed beyond the group stages in 1986, where they were eventually beaten by Germany 1-0 in the round of 16. .The team is hoping to make its mark in Qatar, boosted by the return of Ziyech who announced his international retirement in February 2022 after falling out with former coach Vahid Halilhodzic. .For Croatia, this will be the first World Cup fixture since losing to France in the final four years ago. .The Checkered Ones crashed out of the Euro 2020 last-16 after losing to Spain 5-3, but have won 15 out of the last 16 games. .They will need to rely on Tottenham’s Ivan Perisic to give them a lot more in attack if they are to have a deep run. Veteran Luka Modric will take up his position in midfield with Mateo Kovacic. .Croatia won their two FIFA World Cup games against African opposition with an aggregate of 6-0 (4-0 against Cameroon in 2014 and 2-0 against Nigeria in 2018). .While Belgium sees itself as coming out on top of Group F, there is plenty of potential for Croatia and Morocco to make it to the next round.",454

They then knocked out Greece in the round of 16, reaching the quarter-finals, where they lost to the Netherlands on penalties. .They have again drawn a difficult group this year, with Germany, Spain and Japan. .In Spain, they will face a team that includes a mix of young promising players such as 18-year-old Gavi and 19-year-old Pedri — both midfielders — as well as seasoned veterans such as Chelsea defender César Azpilicueta. .Under manager Luis Enrique, Spain have enjoyed a strong run of form recently, topping their UEFA Nations League group and picking up a morale-boosting win against Portugal in September. .But anyone who underestimates Costa Rica does so at their peril. Los Ticos have won their last five matches and notched up some impressive performances in their World Cup qualification campaign, including wins over Canada and the United States. .“The first match is always difficult, but on paper, Spain is the favourite to beat Costa Rica,” says Sayed Nabawy, a sports journalist specialising in Spanish football.  “A win would give Spain confidence in the next game, where they will meet Germany.” .Costa Rica are expected to play a conservative brand of football. It is a style they have become known for in recent years and is one that frustrated several high-profile teams in 2014. At the heart of the defensive structure is Keylor Navas, the Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper who has made more than 100 appearances for his country. .Spain will look to their attacking flair to break down an often-stubborn Costa Rican defence. They will not want a repeat of their opening match at Euro 2020 against Sweden, where they failed to score despite having 17 shots on goal and a staggering 86 percent of the possession. .Costa Rica will face a tough task up front, with the 30-year-old ex-Arsenal forward Joel Campbell facing the likes of Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal and Barcelona’s Eric Garcia in defence. Spain have not conceded more than two goals in a game since they beat Croatia 5-3 at Euro 2020 more than a year ago. .Spain have decided to leave several high-profile names out of their World Cup squad, including Navas’ former Real Madrid teammate Sergio Ramos and Manchester United’s David de Gea. .Neither team performed well at the last World Cup, with Costa Rica finishing bottom of their group with only one point and Spain losing to Russia in the last 16. They will both want to make up for that in Qatar – starting on Wednesday.",455

When: 7pm (16:00 GMT) .This is perhaps the first time since Euro 2016 that Belgium arrive at a major tournament without being heralded as contenders – the sheen of their Golden Generation has worn off. .They have won each of their six group matches in the past two World Cups but they’ll struggle this time in a group featuring 2018 finalists Croatia, Morocco and their opening-game opponents, Canada. .Canada’s Maple Leafs have arrived in Doha full of hope. This will be only their second World Cup appearance – the first since 1986. .Belgium’s track record over the past few years shows that they comfortably beat lower-ranked sides but stumble against quality opposition. They lost to the eventual champions France in the 2018 World Cup and to Italy in the quarterfinal of the Euros last year. .Eden Hazard, one of the standout Belgium players in the 2018 World Cup, has hardly featured for Real Madrid since his move in 2019. While many called for him to be replaced by Leandro Trossard in the starting XI, manager Roberto Martinez’s faith in his captain has not wavered. .Romelu Lukaku has been plagued by injuries and poor form over the past year and the Red Devils lack a strong backup striker to make up for his absence. The lynchpins of their defence, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, have a combined age of 68. . .  .Kevin de Bruyne and Thibaut Courtois, arguably the only two world-class players in the squad, will be key to Belgium’s chances. .The Maple Leafs secured their spot in the tournament in style, winning eight of their 14 games in the CONCACAF qualifiers, defeating heavyweights Mexico and USA. .While 22-year-old Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies is the undoubted Canada star, Lille striker Jonathan David and Club Brugge forward Cyle Larin showed in the qualifiers. Larin was the top scorer with 11 goals, with David close behind in second with nine. .The pace and verve of Canada’s attack will make for a fascinating battle against the ageing but experienced Belgium rearguard. The only time these two sides have met before was in a friendly in 1989 that Belgium won 2-0. .Belgium enter the World Cup in indifferent form, having lost to Netherlands and Egypt in their last two outings.

They’re the highest-ranked Asian team at the tournament, and many of the youngsters in their squad are competing for national glory and aiming to put on a show for the talent scouts. .On Wednesday, in front of 40,000 fans at the Khalifa International Stadium, attackers Daichi Kamada, Kaoru Mitoma, and Takumi Minamino of Japan will square up to Germany’s Ilkay Gundogan, Joshua Kimmich, and Jamal Musiala in the battle for midfield dominance. .Kamada has solid experience in German football, plying his trade at Eintracht Frankfurt, by playing with industry and creativity in the hole behind the striker. Others who also play in the Bundesliga include Stuttgart’s Wataru Endo and Ritsu Doan – aka “the Japanese Messi”, whose left foot has put a shot past one of the world’s best goalkeepers in Manuel Neuer while playing with Freiburg. .At 5’8″, Doan has a low centre of gravity that helps his tight dribbling and explosive breaks down the right wing. .A win for Japan would be quite an upset, but if they are to make it through to the round of 16, Coach Hajime Moriyasu’s men are going to have to make – and take – their chances against a well-drilled German side looking to be world champions again.",457

But, as Al Jazeera’s Nils Adler noted, the Argentinians had failed to capitalise on their onslaught and even clocked up seven offsides in total despite their dominance of the early part of the game. .Then came the second half, and a changed Saudi side emerged from the dressing room as they threw everything at victory. And their determination and skill paid off. .Saudi Arabia’s Saleh al-Shehri scored first in the 48th minute after intercepting a long ball, which he skilfully shot through Argentinian goalkeeper Damián Martinez’s legs and into the corner. .In what seemed just moments later, Saudi winger Salem al-Dawsari got inside Argentina’s defence and beautifully curled the ball into the top corner of the net. .The Saudi fans erupted in elation and likely a little joyous surprise. .The astonishing game, which involved some 15 nail-biting minutes of extra injury time, ended with the Saudi players on the pitch the victors and their Green Falcons fans jumping in the stadium’s stands. .“We supported our team better than the other side, and we have been rewarded,” said Shaqri, who had travelled from the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran for the match. .When Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic blew the final whistle, the FIFA Fan Festival site in central Doha exploded in celebrations as the shock of such a historic win began to sink in locally and globally. .Across the Qatari capital, Doha, drivers honked their cars’ horns and formed impromptu celebratory corteges. .It was a match of firsts: The first time Saudi Arabia had beaten Argentina. It was also the first victory for a Middle East football team at this World Cup, which is also being held in the Middle East region for the first time. .Messi, playing in his fifth World Cup, later described his team’s loss as a “very heavy blow”. .Argentina had maintained a 36-match unbeaten streak until their defeat by Saudi Arabia. .“We didn’t expect to start this way,” Messi said. .“We need to prepare for what is coming. We need to win or win, and that depends on us. We have to return to the foundation of who we are,” he said. .Saudi Arabia’s coach, Frenchman Herve Renard, said after the match that the team should not celebrate too much over what he described as a “totally crazy” win. .“All the stars in the sky were aligned for us,” Renard said after the game. “This is football, sometimes totally crazy things can happen,” he said. .“We needed to get this result, it will be one for the [history] books, but as a coach I’m always asking for more from my players, so let’s stay humble.” .Denmark vs Tunisia .Denmark against Tunisia were up next, kicking off at 4pm local time (13:00 GMT) at the Education City Stadium in what would be a high-energy but no-scoring match between the Danes and the Tunisians. .There was an electric atmosphere at the stadium, where it was difficult to spot a Danish fan in the sea of red-and-white-clad Tunisians. .The Tunisians — known to their fans as the Eagles of Carthage — controlled the early stages of the game, but the Danes eventually settled into the match and began, in turn, to dominate possession. .Tunisia, who brought bundles of energy from the very first touch of the ball, missed some almost-certain shots in both the first and second half, while the best chance of a goal in the entire game appeared to come from Denmark’s Andreas Cornelius, who surprised all with a head ball that landed against the goal post though he had launched his shot from almost point-blank range. .A draw may have been the fairest outcome, but both teams will have some soul-searching to do as to why their energy and many shots on goal did not convert into points scored. .But the Tunisia fans were happy that their side had earned a hard-fought draw against the Danes, particularly after the earlier Saudi win over Argentina in what was a jubilant day for Arab fans and teams at the World Cup. .  .Mexico vs Poland .In the cooler evening air of Qatar, it was Mexico against Poland who kicked off at 7pm local time (16:00 GMT) inside Stadium 974. .Placed at 13th in the FIFA rankings, none would underestimate the Mexicans with their trio of attackers: Raul Jimenez, Edson Alvarez and Hirving Lozano. .The Poles, though placed at 26th in the FIFA ranking and making just their ninth appearance at the World Cup since their debut in 1938, fielded star striker Robert Lewandowski — who in October won the Gerd Müller Trophy for best striker of the year — and so had good reason to be confident going into the game. .But Poland struggled to cope with Mexico’s intensity in the opening 35 minutes, with the North Americans dominating possession and keeping star striker Lewandowski away from getting his eye on the goal. .Though Mexico dominated the first half, one commentator described a lacklustre performance, even with Mexico having possession of the ball about 63 percent of the time. .At the start of the second half, there was hope that the teams might adopt a more free-flowing style of play, but it was not to be. .Shortly into the second half, Poland were awarded a penalty, which their striker Lewandowski failed to get past Mexico’s keeper Guillermo Ochoa — a miss that prompted the Mexican fans at Stadium 974 to raise the proverbial roof with chants of joy. .The Mexico and Poland match ended with a 0-0 stalemate in their opening Group C fixture. .Australia vs France .In the last match of day three, it was France vs Australia kicking off at 10pm local time (19:00 GMT) at the Al Janoub Stadium. .Despite the French team’s many injuries, the World Cup’s defending champions were the favourites against Australia. .The injury rate was worrying, however: Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema had to withdraw from the team after tearing a muscle in training over the weekend; Christopher Nkunku limped out of training on Tuesday after being tackled by his own teammate; and neither Paul Pogba nor N’Golo Kante was able to travel to Qatar for the tournament. .Making their fifth consecutive World Cup appearance, the Australian “Socceroos” were young and hungry, ready to challenge France. They had a lot to prove on Tuesday as they had yet to emerge out of their group stage since first reaching the World Cup tournament in 2006. .And the game started with an Australia surprise as they shocked the French side by scoring a ninth-minute goal, with Craig Goodwin side-footing the ball into the top corner. .French fullback Lucas Hernandez had to limp off the pitch after being injured while attempting to block the cross that led to the Australian goal. Hernandez’s brother, Theo, then took his place in the French defence and less than 20 minutes later, he was instrumental in Adrien Rabiot’s first goal for Les Bleus. .Just minutes later, and with a little more than half an hour on the match clock, French striker Olivier Giroud, 36, scored the first of what would be two goals in the game. .France moved into the lead and never really looked back as they dominated the second half. .Kylian Mbappe headed in the third French goal in the 67th minute, and minutes later, he broke down the left of the field and sent over a cross that was also headed home by Giroud for his second and France’s fourth goal on the night. .“We got a scare but reacted quickly afterwards. Even if we could have scored more goals, we found each other, we were efficient,” Giroud said after the match. .“It’s very good for our self-confidence to have turned things around. We’ll have to learn from these little mistakes however.” .Australia’s coach Graham Arnold praised the French after the match. .“Look, at the end of the day, they’re are a quality side. They are world champions for a reason,” he added. .“I thought the first half, we did well. Second half, we ran out of legs a bit, but that’s the type of level of those players play at.” .Jubilant Saudi football fans celebrated late into the night, knowing they could rest easy with a lie-in on Wednesday, after Saudi Arabia’s King Salman announced a snap public holiday for workers in the public and private sectors, as well as students, in celebration of the win over Argentina. .Tunisia’s draw with Denmark was also celebrated as a double for Arab fans and teams on Tuesday. .“We, the Arabs, were expected to lose both matches. No one believed we could get these results. But look, who is celebrating? The Arabs,” Ayoub Gherbi, an Algerian who came to Education City Stadium to support Tunisia, told Al Jazeera. .“We can go far. How far? I say the sky is the limit. We [Arabs] are playing at home. Every Arab team will have a strong support.

Though Australia posed a threat on the counterattack, they invited pressure by sitting deep. .Spectacular defending by the Socceroos saw an effort from Antoine Griezmann cleared off the goal line but their defence was not enough to stop Kylian Mbappe from using his head to find his goal in the 67th minute. Five minutes later, Mbappe broke down the left and put in a cross headed home by Giroud for France’s fourth. .“We got a scare but reacted quickly afterwards. Even if we could have scored more goals, we found each other, we were efficient,” said Giroud. .“It’s very good for our self-confidence to have turned things around. We’ll have to learn from these little mistakes however.” .Giroud, now tied with Thierry Henry on a record 51 goals for France, was in the starting 11 due to the injury of Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema, who will miss the entire World Cup. .Injuries hit France hard ahead of the opening match – with midfielders N’Golo Kante and Paul Pogba and forward Christopher Nkunku also ruled out of the tournament – and French coach Didier Deschamps lamented Lucas Hernandez’s injury. .“He needs to do some tests but it seems pretty serious. That’s the big black spot tonight,” Deschamps said. .France lead Tunisia and Denmark in the table by two points after they played out a 0-0 draw earlier on Tuesday .Meanwhile, Australia coach Graham Arnold said his team ran out of gas against a superior side. .“Look, at the end of the day, they’re are a quality side. They are world champions for a reason,” he added. .“I thought the first half, we did well. Second half, we ran out of legs a bit, but that’s the type of level of those players play at.”",461

They cheered and clapped relentlessly every time a Tunisian player touched the ball. .For supporters of Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, watching their teams’ inspired performances on Arab soil was an exhilarating experience. .“Unbelievable day. All Arabs are happy. Proud day to be Arab. First Saudi Arabia showed the world we can play against the best and win. And now us [Tunisia], we showed, we can play one of the best teams in the world and not lose or be scared,” Zohra Dachraoui, a Tunisian supporter, told Al Jazeera soon after watching the match. .Earlier, Lionel Messi – a seven-time Ballon d’Or winner – couldn’t help Argentina as inspired Saudi players snapped at his heels throughout the game. .A visibly disappointed Messi walked around the pitch after the final whistle as the Saudi Arabia bench ran to the field to celebrate the historic win. .Messi, the Argentinian team’s captain and talisman, had opened the scoring from the penalty spot early in the first half. From there, many would have expected Argentina to stroll to victory. .But the early setback inspired a roaring comeback from Saudi Arabia, who scored two quick goals in the second half and held firm against some late Argentinian pressure. .“Football is a very beautiful game full of surprises. We, the Arabs, were expected to lose both matches. No one believed we could get these results. But look, who is celebrating? The Arabs,” Ayoub Gherbi, an Algerian who came to Education City Stadium to support Tunisia, told Al Jazeera. .“Tunisia were the better team against a team everyone in the world says are one of the favourites. They played really well and God willing will continue to bring more joy to Arabs everywhere,” said Gherbi as he joined a group of Tunisian supporters chanting in the stands long after the final whistle had blown. .After today’s inspiring performances, some Arab fans are optimistic about their teams’ chances of progressing in the 32-team football showpiece. .“We can go far. How far? I say the sky is the limit. We [Arabs] are playing at home. Every Arab team will have a strong support. This will give every Arab team a huge boost,” Moez Babboucha, a Tunisian, said.",462

But the Polish striker, who has never scored at the World Cup, saw his shot saved by goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. .In a temporary arena built using 974 recycled shipping containers and overlooking the Gulf, a sea of Mexico fans in green outnumbered their Polish counterparts, making their presence felt in the 40,000-capacity venue. .A flowing game of few fouls but fewer chances came to life around the half-hour mark when Alexis Vega saw his header fly wide before Jesus Gallardo was denied with a last-man tackle when he had an open goal at his mercy two minutes later. .Mexico had the bulk of the possession, but without Raul Jimenez spearheading the attack, Henry Martin struggled to get on the end of chances in the box. .At the other end, Poland failed to get Lewandowski involved as the Barcelona striker – who has scored 18 goals for the Spanish club this season – received little service, as both keepers finished the first half without having to make a save. .With Poland losing the midfield battle, coach Czeslaw Michniewicz made a halftime substitution by hauling off Nicola Zalewski and bringing on central midfielder Krystian Bielik, which allowed Piotr Zielinski to play in an advanced role. .The tactical change seemed to work initially as Poland began creating chances and eventually won the penalty, which Lewandowski shot low only to have Ochoa guess correctly and dive to his left to deny the skipper. .Not to be outdone by Ochoa’s brilliance in goal, Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny also underlined his credentials moments later when he reacted quickly to change direction and deny Martin’s glancing header, which had been on target. .Mexico coach Gerardo Martino replaced Martin and brought on Jimenez with 20 minutes to go in the second half, but the Wolverhampton Wanderers striker, who is returning from a long injury layoff, failed to have a shot on goal.",463

Taxi Jamaiya, the yellow minibuses that ferry mostly working-class people around, were racing as the clock ticked on. On the radio, football pundits spoke in an urgent tone about formation and strategy. .Cafés and bars quickly filled with patrons. Most places were standing-room only. The walls of many premises echoed to the sound of football chanting against the insistent drumming on the traditional tambours. .With their economy in a tailspin amid a cost of living crisis, shortages of basic goods and soaring unemployment, Tunisians do not have much to cheer about these days – but the sight of the team stepping onto the Education City Stadium was enough to send waves of excitement roaring through the busy commercial La Fayette district. .As the game began, a nervous silence took over, interrupted by gasps of delighted surprise every time Tunisia threatened to score a goal. .Half-time found both teams goalless, and inside a Chabbi “salon de thé” (working class tea house), the air was thick with cigarette and shisha smoke. and the sound system belts out popular songs that have become synonymous with the matches of the national team. .Despite the food shortages that have blighted the country this year, the owners did their best to keep things going: Sugar was available for customers to take with coffee, while the milk for their cappuccinos came from a can. .Deep into the second half, and it was still nil all. Denmark scored, but the anguish was short-lived as the goal was disallowed as an offside violation. Then, it was eyes glued to the screen again and deep concentration as fans prayed for Tunisia to make it beyond the groups’ stage for the first time in their sixth appearance at a World Cup. .An emotional rollercoaster, the high-octane match saw Tunisia play very well – but Denmark was dangerous, too. .In the 67th minute, a visibly tired Anis Slimane was substituted by Naim Sliti. Fans cheered on. .“He’s an attacking player, so that’s why everyone’s happy!” said Mohammed, who is in town for a business start-up training course. .“Tunisia are playing really well and against a really strong team,” he added. .There were more cheers in the 80th minute as offensive midfielder Hannibal Mejbri also came. .“He’s a game changer,” said the optimistic Mohammed. .Still, nothing changed and the final whistle found both teams level. But for the Tunisian fans, and the Tunisian players celebrating in Doha, it felt like a victory. .Now, their focus was on the third group match on November 29 against reigning champions and former colonial power France. Or, as Mohammed laughed, “the old oppressor”.",464

I wish the team every success for the remainder of the season and for the future.” .During his interview before the World Cup, Ronaldo said the club’s United States owners, the Glazer family, cared far more about the money-making potential of United than results on the pitch. .The Glazers have long been unpopular with the United faithful, their 17-year reign marked by declining on-field performance and repeated fan protests. .Sky News reported on Tuesday that the Glazers were preparing to formally announce their intention to examine potential sources of outside investment that could include either an auction of United, with a full or partial sale, strategic partnership with third parties or other options. .United have not won the Premier League title since 2013 and has sacked several managers following the retirement of Alex Ferguson. .They have also failed to qualify for this term’s Champions League, a setback that may have encouraged Ronaldo in appearing to push for a move in the pre-season transfer window. .Meanwhile, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said both Ronaldo and the club had got what they wanted. .“Cristiano obviously did that interview with the mindset that he wasn’t happy and wanted to get out of the club,” Ferdinand, who played alongside Ronaldo at Old Trafford, told the BBC. “He made that very clear. .“I think Erik ten Hag got what he wanted in this situation as well. Both parties are happy and we can move on.” .Ronaldo was undoubtedly angered by his reduced status at United, with the club no longer at the summit of English football.",466

Tunisia held European Championship semifinalist Denmark to a 0-0 draw on Tuesday, three hours after Saudi Arabia beat Argentina in a shocking upset. .At an Education City Stadium filled almost entirely with its red-clad supporters, Tunisia likely deserved more but an expert save shortly before halftime by goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel helped Denmark preserve the draw. .Having already gone down to the grass after Tunisia broke through the defence, Schmeichel stuck his hand up to deflect a shot from Issam Jebali, who plays his club ball in Denmark for Odense. .It was just the sort of save that the keeper’s father, former Manchester United great Peter Schmeichel, used to pull off. .The match marked Christian Eriksen’s return to a major tournament less than a year and a half after his cardiac arrest with Denmark at Euro 2020. .Denmark thought they should have had a penalty in stoppage time for handball that was checked at the VAR screen by referee Cesar Arturo Ramos, but he instead gave a free kick to Tunisia for a foul in the build-up. .Denmark would have hoped to create more chances in the game, but their best came late in the second half when Cornelius only had to nod the ball over the line at the back post, but instead flicked it onto the woodwork. .Tunisia, who this week had spoken of their pride at qualifying for World Cup in an Arab country, were fired up from the first whistle, celebrating each tackle like a goal, and had two excellent chances to open the scoring. .The first fell to Denmark-based Issam Jebali when he found himself one-on-one with Kasper Schmeichel. The second saw Aissa Laidouni race clear from his own half, but as he approached the Denmark penalty area, he hesitated and opted for a pass that was not on rather than advancing 10 yards and having an effort on goal. .In the context of the game, both might look at it as two points dropped, but Tunisia will certainly be the happier, given the low level of expectation placed on them – from outside their camp at least – going into the tournament. .They will face Australia next on Saturday, a game they will have targeted as their most winnable in the group, while Denmark meet France behind the points tally they would have set for themselves at this stage.",468

However, as Denmark grew accustomed to the game’s intensity, they grew into the match with their talisman Christian Eriksen pulling the strings in midfield. .Tunisia missed a couple of gilt-edged chances either side of half-time as their fans continued to heap pressure on Danish players with whistles and boos. .The first fell to Issam Jebali, who forced a fine save from Kasper Schmeichel. The Danish shot-stopper spread himself wide, deflecting Jebali’s delicate finish away from goal. .In the second half, Alissa Laidouni, the midfielder and Tunisia’s best player on the day, was able to break past the Danish defensive line but lacked the pace to rattle Schmeichel in a one-on-one. Laidouni eventually lost possession as he tried to square it across the goal. .After a short lull in the match, the game burst into life again in the 70th minute after the ball fell to Denmark’s Andreas Cornelius, who inexplicably headed against the post from point-blank range. .Only a minute later, Tunisia had a penalty claim waved away after the referee deemed Joachim Andersen’s hand had been naturally positioned after the ball struck it. .Tunisia began to run out of steam, and Denmark slowly began to take control of the match. .In the 94th minute, it was Denmark’s turn to have a penalty turned down after the referee was called over to the VAR screen for a suspected handball. .It was a nervy finish for the Tunisians, who had started the stronger team but had clearly run out of energy by the end. Their fans, however, who had created an incredible atmosphere in the stadium, were vocal throughout, cheering their team on to the final whistle. .Eventually, a draw seemed like a fair result, but both sides will be concerned that they could not convert some strong chances. France and Australia are the other two teams in Group D, and every point will count as the teams look to break through to the round of 16.",469

Two quick goals by Saleh al-Shehri and Salem al-Dawsari early in the second half stunned the Argentinian side, which had taken an early lead with a Lionel Messi penalty in the 10th minute. .“After that second goal, I thought we could go up 4-1,” said Fahd al-Kanani, a fan who travelled to Qatar from Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. .“I was not worried like some of my friends were,” the 25-year-old said. “All we had to do was defend. The pressure was all on Argentina.” .The Argentinians did apply pressure, but a series of saves from the Saudi goalkeeper, Mohammed Al-Owais, kept the scoreline intact and in favour of the underdogs, who are ranked 51st in the world in FIFA’s standings, compared with their opponents’ third place. .The end of the agonising game, which had about 15 minutes of injury time, found the Saudi players on the pitch overjoyed and their fans in the stands on their feet and jumping. .“We supported our team better than the other side, and we have been rewarded,” said Shaqri, who travelled from the eastern Saudi city of Dhahran. .At the opposing end, Argentina’s dejected fans were quick to head to the exits of the stadium, the tournament’s largest with nearly 89,000 seats. .“This is a nightmare. I never expected this,” Bruno, 31, who came from Dubai told Al Jazeera. “Like this is supposed to be Messi’s tournament, and here we are losing to a much lower-ranked team. .“I am truly distraught.” .It was an entirely different atmosphere before the 1pm (10:00 GMT) kickoff when upbeat Argentina supporters turned the area around the stadium into a sea of blue and white jerseys and flags while chanting, “Vamos Argentina,” or “Let’s go, Argentina.” .The optimism was built on the Albiceleste entering the World Cup with an impressive run of 36 consecutive unbeaten matches. They were seen as their clear favourites of Group C against the likes of Mexico, Poland and Saudi Arabia – but the shock defeat in their opener has now cast doubts on their chances ahead. .“This is unreal, really,” Jamie, 48, lamented. “I am very angry. This should not have been a hard game. We never took our chances. Now we have Mexico and Poland, who will be much tougher. I have a bad feeling we will not make it into the next round.” .Fans not rushing to leave the scene of Argentina’s defeat discussed what had gone wrong. .Cecilia, who lives in Qatar’s capital, Doha, said it would be hard to qualify for the next round. .“Other teams like Mexico, Poland will smell blood,” the 27-year-old Argentinian said. “They too will be confident now. But I am here, always supporting.” .Argentina’s next game will be against Mexico on Saturday while Saudi Arabia will take on Poland the same day. .For the Green Falcons fans, however, all that matters is now – and their team’s greatest victory ever. .Shortly after Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic blew the whistle at Lusail Stadium, the FIFA Fan Festival site in central Doha erupted in celebrations by jubilant Saudi fans. .Similar scenes were seen across the Qatari capital with honking cars forming impromptu parades as passers-by joined in the festivities with chants and cheers. .“Nothing beats this,” said Hassan Khalid, 27, from Medina, adding he still could not believe what had happened. .“It’s a dream come true.”",472

Messi had the ball in the back of the net not long after his first, only for the goal to be ruled offside. .Another offside goal followed after Lautaro Martinez dinked the ball over Saudi keeper Mohammed Al-Owais with a cool finish. He reeled away towards the Argentina fans, who had been in fine voice, only for VAR to turn down the goal because of a marginal offside. .In a thoroughly dominant first-half display, Argentina held nearly two-thirds possession but failed to capitalise, straying offside seven times in total. .In the second half, a reinvigorated Saudi team took the field. Saleh Al-Shehri opened their scoring in the 48th minute after latching onto a long ball before guiding a shot through Argentine goalkeeper Damián Martinez’s legs and into the far corner. .The Saudi fans went into raptures as they celebrated a goal, which at the time seemed to go against the run of play. But more was to come. .A few minutes later, winger Salem al-Dawsari cut inside and curled a beauty into the top corner of the goal. If the first half had belonged to Argentina, it was Saudi Arabia’s moment to shine in the second as their fans celebrated in excitement — and possibly some disbelief — at Lusail Stadium. .Argentina tried their best to draw level, but some resolute defending and a string of fine saves from the Saudi keeper stopped them from scoring. .Messi — who has won every other major trophy he has competed for, other than the World Cup — cut a forlorn figure towards the end as he struggled to pull Argentina back into the match. He uncharacteristically guided a close-range header into the palms of Al-Owais in the final minutes, a miss that in many ways was emblematic of Argentina’s performance on the day. .There was more drama left, though. Five minutes into stoppage time, Al-Owais charged out of goal and accidentally kneed al-Dawsari, who received lengthy treatment for his knock before being stretchered off. .Saudi Arabia had never beaten Argentina in their previous four encounters. Their win over the pre-game favourites sparked wild celebrations in the stadium and all around Doha. It was also the first victory for a Middle Eastern side at the World Cup, which the region had never hosted before. Host Qatar lost to Ecuador on Sunday, and Iran were defeated by England on Monday. .Mexico and Poland are the other teams apart from Argentina and Saudi Arabia in Group C.

474,Published On 22 Nov 2022,Argentina fans take over Lusail for World Cup match against Saudi,Supporters of Albiceleste throng tournament’s largest venue to watch Lionel Messi and his teammates kick off World Cup campaign.,".Lusail, Qatar – At Qatar’s largest football venue, Lusail Stadium, there was little doubt who called the tunes: Argentina fans far outnumbered Saudi Arabia’s supporters as the two countries’ men’s national teams took on each other in their opening World Cup 2022 match. .From the metro station corridors to the stands inside the stadium – whose design is inspired by the fanar lantern – it was a sea of blue and white as Argentinians and many of the Albiceleste supporters burst into song and chants of “Vamos Argentina” (Let’s go Argentina). .“Our fans are the best,” Mariano Alvarez, a fan from Rosario, the hometown of Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi, told Al Jazeera. “I know I’m biased but really we don’t let money or work stop us from travelling to support our team,” he said. .“For us, football is a like religion … together with Christianity,” added the 52-year-old, who is attending his second World Cup after Brazil in 2014. .Like thousands of other Argentinians at the stadium, Alvarez had to travel for nearly 24 hours to reach Qatar in a cumbersome journey that included transit in Spain. .In contrast, the Saudi fan figures pale in comparison despite Saudi Arabia being Qatar’s neighbour to the west and sharing a land border. .In addition to those who flew in from Argentina, people from countries such as India, Pakistan, Egypt and Malaysia were among the enthusiastic crowd supporting Messi and his teammates. .As fans streamed towards the nearly 80,000-strong stadium, a Doha-based music group called Qatar Mayyappada welcomed them with drums and percussion – side by side with a group of Argentina fans who had brought their own musical instruments and speakers to uplift the crowd that gathered in the dozens around them. .“[Late Argentinian footballer Diego] Maradona and Messi unite the world,” 26-year-old Ashiq Siddiq, from India, told Al Jazeera inside Legtaifiya metro station, where he and other Argentina supporters were chatting furiously about the team’s formation and strategy ahead of the game. .The tournament in Qatar will be Messi’s fifth World Cup, and likely his last. .The 35-year-old, regarded by many as the world’s best footballer, will be hoping to build on Argentina’s Copa America triumph last year and win the one trophy that has eluded him so far in his illustrious career. .“This is the year,” said Alejandro Fronto, an Argentina fan who believes this is Messi’s best chance to help his team win the trophy. “Messi will not play again after this in another World Cup,” added Fronto. .“He can do it, I believe. The team is more united than previous tournaments. They just won the Copa America last year so there is belief in the team.” .Fronti said with a strong squad that also features the talents of players such as Rodrigo De Paul and Angel De Maria, Argentina will be hard to beat. .“I only worry about Brazil”. .On how Tuesday’s encounter will unfold, an optimistic Fronti said it will be “devastating” for Saudi Arabia, predicting Argentina will beat the six goals that England scored against Iran. .Saudi fans, however, did not seem nervous but were hopeful their team would cause an upset. .“It’s going to be 1-1,” Mohammed Shaks told A Jazeera at Lusail Stadium, cracking a cheeky smile as his friends burst out laughing. .“Many people know Argentina, but Saudi Arabia is the best team in Asia … I’m telling, there will be a surprise,” he said. .However, the 29-year-old, draped in a Qatari and Saudi flag, said even if they lose, he is just glad to be at this game. .“I will at least get to see Messi in Qatar, which is like my second home,” he  says, noting that many Saudis like him have family in the host country with whom they are staying.",474

Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante, both stalwarts of the team that won the 2018 World Cup, were unable to travel to Qatar. Christopher Nkunku was forced to limp out of training on Tuesday after being tackled by his own teammate. .Despite these injuries, France’s team offers an embarrassment of riches, with Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann expected to lead the charge for Les Bleus in Benzema’s absence. With Pogba and Kante missing, manager Didier Deschamps will likely look to Aurelien Tchouameni and Adrien Rabiot to take their place in midfield. .The two teams met in the last World Cup, with France narrowly beating Australia 2-1 in the group stage courtesy of an own goal and a penalty. France will hope for a convincing win this time. But Australia will look to draw inspiration from their 2018 performance against the eventual tournament winners. .This is the fifth consecutive World Cup appearance for Australia’s Socceroos. However, they are yet to make it out of the group stage since they reached the round of 16 in 2006 with their “golden generation”, which included players like Tim Cahill, Harry Kewell, and Mark Viduka. .“Australia come into this tournament with an eclectic group of players: a handful have previous World Cup experience, but the majority are at their first finals ever, with nine most recently representing the under-23s side at the Tokyo Olympics,” says Samantha Lewis, an Australian football writer. .  .  .Still, what Australia’s team lacks in experience it makes up with youth — and just possibly, the appetite to challenge France. .Lewis describes the Australia squad as “filled with young, hungry players given their first big shot on the world stage, which is both exciting and nerve-wracking in equal measure”. .Graham Arnold, Australia’s manager, has become known for a pragmatic style of play in recent years. Against France, he will likely rely on regulars such as Celtic midfielder Aaron Mooy and veteran goalkeeper and skipper Mathew Ryan to provide organisation and discipline as they face some of finest footballers on the planet. .Australia also boast talented Cadiz winger Awer Mabil in their ranks, as well as teenager Garang Kuol, who has just signed with Newcastle United in the Premier League. Ajdin Hrustic, who won the 2022 Europa League and now plies his trade in the Serie A, appears to have shaken off an injury and will be able to provide a creative spark in midfield. .Lewis says there is little expectation in Australia that their team will overcome Les Bleus. However, she admits to some cautious optimism.  “France aren’t the force they were four years ago thanks to a string of untimely injuries and drama within the camp,” she said. “So, there are some pockets of faithful fans (including me) who reckon they could pinch a goal or two if France takes as long to warm into the tournament as they have in the past.”",477

We’ll find out when the stalwart Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo “Memo” Ochoa comes up against Poland’s Robert Lewandowski in their Group C encounter on Tuesday. .While both these players are well into their mid-thirties, the fortunes of their teams in this World Cup hinge heavily on them. Ochoa’s eye-catching saves in the previous two editions, particularly his performance against Brazil in 2014, have made him a World Cup cult hero. . .Lewandowski is one of the most skilled marksmen in world football today and in October he won the Gerd Müller Trophy for best striker of the year. But he has a point to prove: While the Barcelona forward has more than 600 goals for club and country, he’s yet to score in the World Cup. .There’s plenty at stake. The group includes Lionel Messi’s Argentina, one of the tournament favourites, and low-ranked Saudi Arabia, which isn’t expected to proceed to the next stage of the tournament. That means the outcome of the Mexico-Poland match could well determine which of the two secures qualification to the next round. .Mexico has made it out of the group stages in each of the last seven World Cups. In the 2018 edition, they famously defeated holders Germany 1-0 in the group stage but went out to Brazil in the Round of 16. .Poland’s World Cup appearances haven’t been as eventful. They haven’t made it past the group stages since 1982 and they failed to qualify for the 2010 and 2014 editions of the tournament. In 2018, they lost their opening two matches before defeating Japan in their final group game. .The two countries have played each other thrice before, the last being in 2017. They’ve both won a game each and have shared a draw. They enter the tournament in similar form, having both won just two of their last five games. .There’s no better time to step up than a crunch game like Tuesday’s.",478

480,Published On 22 Nov 2022,Iran’s coach angered over political pressure on World Cup squad,Iran’s World Cup 2022 coach Carlos Queiroz has called on fans to allow his team to be ‘simple football’ players.,".Iran’s World Cup team coach Carlos Queiroz has vented anger at players being dragged into a crisis in their home country, telling the team’s Iranian compatriots not to harass and politicise his team and to let them focus on their tournament campaign. .Speaking after his side’s 6-2 pummelling by England in their World Cup opener on Monday, Queiroz said his players, who have a high profile at home, had been criticised heavily and even threatened over issues that had nothing to do with football. .Iran’s “Team Melli”  – the national team – have been in the spotlight in the run-up to the World Cup, with many Iranians seeking their public endorsement for continuing protests that have become the most sustained challenges to the legitimacy of Iran’s rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. .“To those who come to disturb the team with the issues that are not only about the football opinions, they’re not welcome because our boys, they’re just simple football boys,” Queiroz told a news conference. .“Let the kids play the game. Because this is what they’re looking for. They wanted to represent the country, to represent the people, as any other national team that are here. And all the national teams, there are issues at home.” .Some fans have accused the team of siding with Tehran’s crackdown against protesters. Activists say more than 400 people have been killed in the violence so far, including dozens of minors, which were sparked by the death two months ago of Mahsa Amini, 22, after her arrest under the country’s strict Islamic dress code. .Some Iran team fans in Qatar have also signalled support for the protesters back home by wearing T-shirts with the words: “Women, life, freedom”, echoing the popular chant of the movement that has arisen since Amini’s death. .The team’s captain, Ehsan Hajsafi, had on Sunday cautiously broke the team’s silence on the protests and said his squad supported and sympathised with their people. .But, in a show of solidarity with the protesters on Monday, the team declined to sing the Iranian national anthem before the match and celebrations of their two goals were muted, following similar moves by other Iranian sportsmen and women. .Jeers were also audible throughout the anthem, while some Iranian fans were seen holding signs professing their support for women’s rights. .The decision not to sing the national anthem was not the first time the Iranian team has shown symbolic support for the protesters. In late September, the team opted to wear black jackets to cover the country’s colours in their friendly against Senegal. .  .The Portuguese Queiroz, who led Iran to the 2018 World Cup, said he was proud of his players for the political pressure they had to deal with and urged England and upcoming Group B opponents Wales and the United States to rally behind them. .“You don’t know what the kids have been experiencing behind the scenes just because they want to play football,” he said. .“Of course, we have our opinions and we will express them in the right time. But I love the game and don’t want the players to do something that isn’t loyal to the game that is about the entertainment, joy and pride,” he said. .“They only have one dream, to play for the country, to play for the people and I am very proud of the way they stand up and keep fighting.”",480

Coach Lionel Scaloni’s charges know a convincing victory against the Gulf side is expected — even demanded — by their legions of fans. .Their hopes for glory were forged during an incredible 36-game unbeaten run dating back to 2019 and have taken on increased poignancy following recent indications from Messi that this will be his last World Cup. .The diminutive 35-year-old has been in sparkling form for club and country over the past year, lighting up his second season at Paris Saint-Germain with 12 goals and 14 assists in 19 games to date. .Considered by many to be the greatest footballer of his generation, he will be assisted in Qatar by an array of supporting talent including attackers Ángel Di Maria and Lautaro Martínez, and midfielders Rodrigo De Paul and Leandro Paredes. .Argentina possess a miserly defence, too, dampening the prospects of the Green Falcons pulling off an upset and adding to the predictions of some that the side from South America may be back at Lusail Stadium for the World Cup final on December 18. .But Saudi Arabia will be determined to try and frustrate the Albiceleste, who were last crowned world champions in 1986. .If they are to enjoy any success, the Saudis will need to be flawlessly organised in their own half and ready to hit the Argentines on the break when opportunities to counterattack present themselves. .Manager Herve Renard will be fully aware of the scale of the challenge ahead, with difficult fixtures against fellow Group C challengers Poland and Mexico looming next. However, he and his players will take heart from an excellent qualification campaign that saw them book a place at this year’s tournament with two games in hand, securing a sixth World Cup appearance since their inaugural showing in the 1994 edition. .Talisman Salem Al-Dawsari will offer Saudi’s greatest threat with his creative wing play and comes into the competition on the back of the most prolific season of his career to date, having scored heavily for Riyadh-based club side Al-Hilal. .The 31-year-old is unlikely to be short of support from the stands, with tens of thousands of Saudi Arabia fans expected to attend the first-ever World Cup in the Middle East. Among them will be Abdullah Alsulmi, who has trekked on foot more than 1,500km (930 miles) from the Red Sea port city of Jeddah to Qatar, to cheer his side on. .But regardless of results, the team’s appearance at the tournament alone marks something of a win for its supporters. For more than three years, Riyadh had led a regional economic blockade of Qatar that threatened to undermine Saudi Arabia’s participation in the competition, and some feared, the tournament itself. .Now that’s history: The blockade was eventually lifted in early 2021. Saudi Arabia and Argentina will have their focus on the next month — starting Tuesday.",481
482,Published On 22 Nov 2022,"Amid economic crisis, Argentina hopes for World Cup glory","Straining under the weight of a prolonged crisis, Argentina fans look for football glory at the World Cup.",".Buenos Aires, Argentina – Marina Leon holds out a string of white and blue paper flags at her small, family-run bar, where the door is kept wide open in hopes of a gentle breeze wafting in and offering respite from the heat. .For the next few weeks, the flags will decorate the establishment in the middle-class neighbourhood of La Paternal. Leon, 62, and her husband, Tato Lenoce, 65, opened the bar a year and a half ago after being forced to close their previous bar during the pandemic because they were behind on their rent. .Today, it is in many ways a mirror to the brutal economic pain that millions of people in Argentina have endured over the past year and a bit – and to the dreams that many harbour as the national men’s team prepares for its first match at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .The jerseys and football paraphernalia that adorn the bar’s walls are mostly donated, just like the pots and pans the couple cooks with and the mismatched cutlery resting on tables covered with white tablecloths. Leon and Lenoce pooled their resources to get the place up. They bought a large flat-screen television to broadcast World Cup games – they had to forego air conditioning. Now they wait, with their customers, for a month they hope to remember – never mind the humidity that Argentina’s capital is notorious for. .“I hope with all my heart that we win,” said Leon. “To give people a little bit of joy. People have really been struggling because of the economic situation we’re in.” .A prolonged economic crisis has eviscerated the value of the Argentinian peso and sent the annual inflation rate soaring to 88 percent in October. Argentinians are praying for reprieve, even if temporary, in the form of football glory. . .Ever since their captain, superstar Lionel Messi, led them to the Copa America win last year, expectations have been mounting that the country might finally clinch its third World Cup after years of disappointments. .The jerseys are everywhere. Bakeries are opening before dawn on Tuesday for the team’s inaugural match against Saudi Arabia – which will be at 7am local time – screens on public buses are playing clips of epic moments in the national squad’s history and it seems like, everywhere you look, there is a likeness of Messi or the iconic Diego Maradona, who died in November 2020 of heart failure and pulmonary oedema. .At a recent sold-out concert of British rock band Coldplay in a football stadium in Buenos Aires, fans broke out in an impromptu serenade to Messi, while for weeks, a frenzy over collectable World Cup stickers dominated social media. . .Criticism of Qatar as a host for the World Cup has not figured prominently in Argentina, where, for the most part, the focus is on the country’s team and its prospects. .“Argentinians have to think about how we’re going to win the World Cup with Messi,” President Alberto Fernandez said while in Bali, Indonesia, for the G20 summit earlier this month. “We have a great team and a great coach.” Lionel Scaloni, Argentina’s coach, was also in charge during the Copa America win in 2021. .Indeed, it’s hard for Daniel Rodriguez to think of anything other than the World Cup these days. Like many of his compatriots, the 50-year-old has his passion for football etched on his skin – literally. A tattoo of the local club he supports, Atlanta, is hidden under the blue and white national jersey he is sporting on a Saturday morning in La Paternal as he waits for his wife with his 10-year-old daughter. .He lowers his voice to reveal his allegiance since the neighbourhood is the home of Atlanta’s rival club, Argentinos Juniors, which was also Maradona’s first club. “For Argentinians, football means a lot. We wake up with football, we eat football and we dream of football,” he said. .At the auto parts manufacturer where he works, all eyes will be on the television set for games that fall during work hours, he said. Rodriguez is optimistic about the team’s chances, even if his predictions are measured. “As all football fans say, one step at a time.” .Alejandro Wall, an Argentinian sports journalist who has written several books on football and Maradona, said a few factors make this tournament stand out. .There is consensus over the strength of the team representing the country. It is also expected to be Messi’s last World Cup – his last shot at the coveted trophy. In Argentina, “football absorbs everything”, Wall said, even if it will not change the stark realities people are living. .Speaking from Qatar, he said he has been personally touched by the ties that bind his squad to fans from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan he has met. .“It’s the Third World united. Or countries colonised versus countries that were colonisers. I think there’s something along those lines that is happening here, too,” he told Al Jazeera. “It’s lovely to meet an Indian fan who has an Argentina jersey and is sending you good vibes.” .Back near La Paternal, there’s a different vibe – a spiritual one – that football fanatics come to soak up, at a permanent memorial dedicated to Maradona. .Diego Vannucci, Maradona’s godson – his father and the player’s agent were friends – is now caretaker of the space that sprung up on a quiet residential street in the wake of the football legend’s death. Located in what used to be lawnmower storage for the Argentinos Juniors’ stadium – just outside La Paternal – it is covered in jerseys, posters, photos, signs, piles of rosaries and other memorabilia and is dripping in love for one of the country’s favourite sons. .There are three rows of church pews where fans sit in contemplative silence, staring at a large mural of a young, smiling Maradona. Vannucci points out recent additions to the memorial, left by visitors: A red poster of Maradona’s Argentinos Junior days; a Mexican 20 peso note; a small card from Fiorito, the soccer star’s hometown. .For many in Argentina, this World Cup will be different simply because of the absence of Maradona who was more than a player. It is his larger-than-life personality that will be missed, suggested Vannucci. .“It feels empty, that’s the only way to describe it,” said the 45-year-old. “You know that Diego is not here. But on the other hand, you can feel him, accompanying us.” .To the final, Argentina will hope.",482

Paris St Germain (PSG) forward Kylian Mbappe was their top player, with a value of 185 million euros ($190m). .The top three were followed by Spain at 1.2 billion euros ($1.23bn), Portugal at 1.15 billion euros ($1.18bn) and Germany at 1.02 billion euros ($1.05bn). .The CIES Football Observatory put the overall value of all the squads at the World Cup 2022 at 15 billion euros ($15.4bn) based on a statistical technique involving more than 2,000 transactions of players transferred from clubs in the five major European leagues during the period from July 2012 to November 2021. .In terms of insurable value, England’s squad again topped the list of World Cup teams with an estimated insurable value of 3.17 billion pounds ($3.76bn), according to an analysis by Lloyd’s of London and backed by the Centre for Economics and Business Research. .England edged out France at 2.66 billion pounds ($3.15bn) and Brazil at 2.56 billion pounds ($3.04bn) to claim the top spot. .Lloyd’s said the assessment of insurable value comprises a variety of metrics such as wages, sponsorship, age and on-field positions. .Bellingham was rated the most insurable player, followed by Mbappe and Vinicius Jr. .Lloyd’s model is based on the belief that the quality of a team can be assessed by measuring factors such as player salaries, incomes from endorsements, and ages, as the value of a team is a good indicator of its talent on the pitch.",484

He trained individually on Friday and Saturday because of what the Argentinian football federation described as “muscle overload”. .Fitness concerns had raised questions about whether Messi would play the full 90 minutes against Saudi Arabia, but he played those concerns down when making a rare appearance at a news conference on Monday. .“I feel very good physically, I think I’m in a great moment, both personally and physically and I don’t have any problems,” Messi said. .“I heard that they said I trained differently. It was because I had a knock but there is nothing strange [happening]. It was just a precaution,” he said. .The Argentina captain cut a remarkably relaxed figure ahead of Tuesday’s game against Saudi Arabia in Doha, as he repeatedly stressed how much he was enjoying football as his glittering career enters its final chapters. .The 35-year-old, playing his fifth World Cup in Qatar, added that he did not prepare differently for the tournament, which for the first time is being played in November and December. .“I didn’t do anything special,” he said. .“I took care of myself and worked as I have done all my career, knowing that this is a special moment, as this is probably my last World Cup, my last chance to achieve this great dream that I have, that we all have.” .On a 36-match unbeaten run, Argentina opens their group stage against Saudi Arabia, the second lowest-ranked team at the tournament. .It seems like an ideal chance for Messi to push his international goals tally towards a century — he currently has 91 — in what is surely a forlorn attempt to catch the leading men’s mark of 117, owned by great rival Cristiano Ronaldo from Portugal. .How Argentina Coach Lionel Scaloni treats Messi for the opening game in the 80,000-seat Lusail Stadium might be instructive, given how the captain’s fitness has been managed heading into the World Cup. .Messi might not be needed for too long against Saudi Arabia. .The Saudis might have come through the Asian qualifying rounds relatively comfortably, but they tend to struggle on football’s highest stage, reaching the last 16 just once in their five appearances at the World Cup. .They started the 2018 World Cup tournament with a 5-0 loss to host-nation Russia. .Then again, Argentina opened the World Cup in 2018 with a disappointing 1-1 draw with tiny Iceland — in a match which saw Messi have a penalty saved — that immediately put pressure on the Albiceleste. .Messi is looking to finally win the World Cup to boost his standing as arguably football’s greatest-ever player. .“It’s most likely my last World Cup,” he reiterated, “my last opportunity to make my — our — dream a reality.” .By playing against Saudi Arabia, Messi will become the first Argentinian player to play in five World Cups, one more than Diego Maradona and Javier Mascherano. .Under French Coach Hervé Renard, the Saudis have been in preparation for several weeks after domestic competitions were paused so players could focus on the World Cup. .They also received a visit from Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who gave a speech to the squad before the tournament. .“It was very positive,” Renard said on Monday. .“It was very important to hear from our leader prior to leaving for such a great competition,” he said. .“We haven’t come to this World Cup just for a jolly. We have come here to be the best we can. We hope all the Saudis in the stadium will be proud of us, that is the most important thing.”",485

He said the US should have won because the team dominated the match for long periods and took the lead, only for Wales to equalise with a late penalty kick. .Vladimir Guzman, another US fan, also said he was less than satisfied with the draw, but he was happy enough to see the USMNT in Qatar, especially given his native Bolivia has not qualified for the World Cup since 1994. .“Why would I be disappointed? I think we played great,” he told Al Jazeera. .With football — known in the US as soccer — growing in popularity over the years, the World Cup is capturing people’s attention across the country. .Viewers are adjusting their daily schedules, and some cities are even changing regulations to accommodate the tournament. For example, in Washington, DC, the city council passed an emergency measure to allow bars and restaurants to stay open 24-7 for the World Cup. .At DuPont Circle on Monday, jubilant fans roared, jumped and embraced when American striker Timothy Whea put the ball past the Welsh keeper and into the back of the net to put the team up 1-0 in the 36th minute. .The jersey-wearing and flag-waving fans were not deterred by the cold weather as they came together to watch the game. .“It’s been a long time coming,” 21-year-old Mamadou Wone said of the US return to the World Cup. “Last time we missed out, and it was kind of heartbreaking to me. But at least we’re back, and hopefully we can go as far as we possibly can.” .Egyptian-American Youssef Ibrahim, standing in a US team shirt with an American flag sticker on his cheek, was among the most visibly enthused fans at the watch party. He was 11 years old the last time the US played in a World Cup. .“Everyone has been waiting for this moment for eight years now,” Ibrahim told Al Jazeera. “It’s just a crazy feeling.”",486

He scored after a pass from Christian Pulisic in the 36th minute. .The United States was back in the World Cup after missing the 2018 tournament and appeared headed to victory. But Walker Zimmerman ploughed down Bale from behind with the Welsh star’s back to the goal, and Bale converted the penalty for his 41st international goal. .Bale put his kick to the left of goalkeeper Matt Turner’s outstretched arm for his 41st goal in 109 international appearances, salvaging a point for Wales in its first World Cup match since 1958. .“The most important thing was that we didn’t lose,” Weah said. “We kept a tie, and now we just focus on the next game.” .Next up for the United States is a high-profile matchup against England on Friday, the same day Wales faces Iran. England opened with a 6-2 rout of the Iranians earlier Monday. .Tim Weah, just 22, was part of a new-look American team that is the second-youngest in the tournament. .“It was a hard-fought game. We left everything out there,” US coach Gregg Berhalter said.",487
488,Published On 21 Nov 2022,Dutch stage winning return to World Cup with win over Senegal,,".Three-time World Cup finalists the Netherlands returned to the biggest international stage after an eight-year absence, beating Senegal 2-0 on Monday in their Group A match with late goals from Cody Gakpo and substitute Davy Klaassen. .The Dutch, who had failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, have now gone 16 games without defeat since coach Louis van Gaal took over for a third time, making him the most successful Dutch coach with 38 wins, surpassing Dick Advocaat. .They also stretched an unbeaten record in their opening game at World Cups that dates back to 1938. .Yet they looked to be heading for a scrappy goalless draw after wasting several chances before man-of-the-match Gakpo beat goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to nod in Frenkie de Jong’s cross with the back of his head. .Klaassen then pounced on a weak Mendy save to score on the rebound nine minutes into stoppage time. .The Dutch join Ecuador, 2-0 winners over hosts Qatar on Sunday, on three points, with the top two meeting on Friday. .“At times we may have been too rushed and tried to force things,” said the Netherlands Captain Virgil van Dijk. “But in the end Cody did it very well.”",488
489,Published On 21 Nov 2022,World Cup: Late penalty earns Wales 1-1 draw with the USA,"Two markedly different performances in each half resulted in a tense, nervy 1-1 draw.",".The opening game for Wales and the USA in this World Cup was billed as the possible deciding match in Group B, determining who would likely finish behind England to qualify for the Group of 16. .A 1-1 draw, however, left the group wide open. .“The most important thing was that we didn’t lose,” said US striker Timothy Weah. .President Joe Biden had described the United States, a country of more than 300 million people, as the “underdogs” in this match. This bemused many in Wales, a nation of a little more than three million that is playing in its first World Cup since 1958. .Football is, as the old cliche goes, a game of two halves. The first period of this match was a frantic, frenetic affair, with neither team settling, the USA pressing high, and Wales scrabbling to make passes. Breathless stuff. .“We could have been braver in the first half,” Wales Coach Rob Page said after the game. .The USA’s Josh Sargent stunned a header into the post in the 10th minute, converting Antonee Robinson’s cross, setting the pace for the opening period. .After 35 minutes in which the Stars and Stripes largely had the upper hand, Timothy Weah — son of former FIFA Player of the Year and current Liberian President George Weah — put his side ahead with a neat finish, supplied by “Captain America” Christian Pulisic. .It was no less than they deserved; their advanced pitch position and the telltale energy of a team with an average age in the mid-20s causing no end of problems for Wales. .And then came the second half. Kieffer Moore was brought on for Daniel James, and the game changed. .“It was nothing against Daniel James, it just suited Kieffer to get us up the pitch,” Wales Manager Rob Page said after the game. “It made a big difference, it was tactical.” .The Welsh wing backs pushed further, acting as midfielders, allowing the midfield to press higher still. Concerted pressure from about the 58th minute gave Wales some momentum; by the 64th minute, Ben Davies was able to make a headed shot, tipped over the bar for a corner. The ensuing delivery gave Kieffer Moore the best chance of the game, but was ultimately fruitless. .Wales made the most of their veterans to calm the nerves and continue to wind up the pressure on the USA back line. Eventually, the cracks showed. An 81st-minute cross into Wales talisman Gareth Bale in the box, a more-than-clumsy attempted tackle by Walker Zimmerman, and the referee pointing to the spot. .Bale rarely misses penalties, and he smashed the ball to the left of US goalkeeper Matt Turner for his 41st goal in 109 matches in a Wales shirt, salvaging a point for his nation in its first World Cup match since 1958. . .Nine minutes of added time resulted in a tense, nervy end to the match that ended 1-1. .“It wasn’t a good first half to be honest, but we had a talk from the gaffer at half-time and came out fighting in the second half,” said Wales captain Gareth Bale. .“We showed character — like we did in the Euros — and we go again … We have to dig deep for our country – we always do.” .The official attendance figure of 43,418 was more than the official capacity of the stadium, while there were many empty seats for much of the first half at least, and scenes of ticketing chaos were reported outside. .“We showed character and determination to get a point out of the game,” Wales Manager Rob Page told ITV Sport after the game. “It’s important at the start of a tournament not to lose a game.” .The draw means both the USA and Wales will be desperate to make a big impact in their games against Iran, with Wales up first against Team Melli on Friday, while the USA takes on England, with the fixtures reversed the following Tuesday in the final group stage games.",489

Our first half performance was slow,” Tobben told Al Jazeera. .Big things were expected of the Dutch in this tournament, particularly after their absence from Russia in 2018. .After overcoming their first and possibly most difficult pre-knockout phase test, they are well poised to qualify as winners from a group that also features hosts Qatar and South American side Ecuador. .Captain Virgil Van Dijk said there was plenty of room for improvement as the tournament progresses. .“We won, but we also know that we can and must do better,” Van Dijk told Dutch broadcaster NOS. .“Going forward, we sometimes tried to force things, and we too often left ourselves exposed to Senegal’s counter-attacks,” he added. .“That is an area in which we will need to improve.”",490

The goal made Bellingham the youngest England scorer at a World Cup since Michael Owen in 1998 and the first player born in 2000 or later ever to score in the finals. .Gareth Southgate’s side was in sparkling form at the Khalifa International Stadium and goals from Saka and Raheem Sterling put them in complete control before half-time. .Saka, 21, netted again after the interval and, although Mehdi Taremi struck twice for Iran, Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish completed the demolition. .There will be far sterner tests to come for England as they bid to win their first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup. .But this was a welcome step in the right direction for Southgate, whose team arrived in Qatar on a six-match winless run that triggered scathing criticism of the Three Lions boss and his perceived negative tactics. .The only concern for Southgate was the sight of Harry Maguire being replaced in the second half after being checked for a potential head injury. .England play their second match against the United States on Friday and conclude their Group B fixtures against Wales on November 29.",491

So no need to set alarms or attempt to stay up to be awake at dawn. An extended lunch break will do. .US players will kick off their campaign against Wales on Monday, then face off against England on Friday, to end their group stage journey in a highly anticipated game against Iran on November 25. .If the USMNT progresses to the knockout stages, where it finishes in Group B will determine the schedule of its subsequent matches. .Games will be played with English commentary either on Fox or its affiliate, FS1. .NBCUniversal-owned Telemundo will air the games with Spanish commentary. Some games will also be on the Spanish-language channel Universo. .Don’t worry, you have many possible streaming options. .NBC’s Peacock streaming app includes Telemundo, which is airing all of the games. Fox and FS1 are also available on several streaming platforms, including YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and fuboTV.

Regular sports bars are also likely to adjust their schedules and broadcast the games. .In the nation’s capital, Washington, DC, the city council passed an emergency measure to allow qualifying establishments to open 24-7 for the World Cup. Special permits will also let bars serve alcohol throughout the day and night, except between 4am and 6am. .In Washington, DC, the opening US game against Wales will be broadcast at a park in Dupont Circle in the heart of the city.

It took more than eight minutes for the keeper to be removed from the pitch despite strict concussion protocol being introduced by FIFA for the tournament. .Shortly after the match restarted, England’s Harry Maguire came close with a powerful header that crashed against the bar. .Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham then opened the scoring in the 35th minute, guiding in a header from a whipped cross from Luke Shaw. .Maguire was involved in England’s second in the 43rd minute after cushioning Shaw’s cross and setting up Bukayo Saka, who fired the ball into the top right corner. .Raheem Sterling made it three before the break after meeting a Harry Kane cross and steering the ball in the bottom right. .The Three Lions continued to dominate in the second half, with Saka grabbing his second as he danced past a few Iranian defenders and steered it into the bottom corner. .Iranian fans, who had been vocal during the first half, began to leave just as Mehdi Taremi lashed a fine strike past a helpless Jordan Pickford. .However, any hope for Iran was short-lived, as Marcus Rashford grabbed a fifth just a few minutes after being brought on by Manager Gareth Southgate. The Manchester United forward showed remarkable composure, taking a couple of touches before stroking it into the bottom corner. .It was set to go from bad to worse for Team Melli after another substitute, Jack Grealish, struck a sixth, casually passing the ball past the Iranian defence and into the bottom corner. .As the game moved into 10 minutes of injury time, Iran were awarded a penalty after a video assistant referee (VAR) review. Taremi calmly slotted in his side’s second consolation goal to muted celebrations from his teammates. .Today’s victory will be a huge morale boost for England, who will be clear favourites to top the group, which includes Wales and the USA. .Iran will need a much better performance if they are to stand any chance of progressing. They have never made it past the group stage at a World Cup. .The win against Iran is now England’s second-best World Cup performance after their 6-1 triumph against Panama back in 2018. .The game, billed as a sporting display as well as one with geopolitical undertones, started on a controversial note as the Iranian team refused to sing their national anthem at the start of the game. .It was a striking act of solidarity with protesters back at home, a situation that began in September when a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, died while in the custody of the Iranian morality police. .Protests have since spread across the nation, challenging the authority of the government even as security forces have cracked down. Hundreds of people have died in the violence. .Before Monday’s game, there were chants of “Say her name, Mahsa Amini” among protesters outside the stadium.",493

Protests have since spread across the nation, challenging the authority of the government even as security forces have cracked down. Hundreds of people have died in the violence. .The decision not to sing the national anthem isn’t the first time the Iranian team has shown support for the protesters. In late September, the team opted to wear black jackets to cover the country’s colours in their friendly against Senegal. . .Before flying out to Doha for the World Cup, the team met with President Ebrahim Raisi. The meeting didn’t go down well with protesters, and banners of the team were burned on the eve of the tournament. .Iran’s beach football, water polo and basketball teams have also recently refused to sing the national anthem. At a news conference on Wednesday, the captain of Iran’s football team, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, refused to confirm if his team would sing the anthem. .“That’s something that also has to be decided about in the team, which we already talked about and obviously everybody’s talking about,” he said. .Ahead of Monday’s game, some Iran fans in Qatar also signalled support for the protesters back home. They wore T-shirts saying, “Women, life, freedom”, which is the popular chant of the movement that has arisen since Amini’s death. .The decision by the football team to remain silent during the anthem on the sport’s biggest stage represents the boldest move so far from the country’s athletic stars. It is unclear whether players will face any consequences. .On Sunday, defender Ehsan Hajsafi became the first Iranian player at the World Cup to publicly speak out in support of the protests. .“They should know that we are with them and we support them and we sympathise with them regarding the conditions,” he said. .England also made a strong political gesture before kickoff by taking the knee in protest of racism and inequality. While they didn’t take the knee in their September friendlies, they’ve decided to do so ahead of every game they will play at the World Cup. .“We think it is a strong statement to go around the world for young people in particular to see that inclusivity is very important,” England manager Gareth Southgate said on Sunday.",494

Many are hailing it as a watershed moment after years of African countries relying heavily on foreign, white and Western coaches while many qualified African candidates were denied opportunities.

Our email is TheTake@aljazeera.net.  .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: The 2022 World Cup in Qatar is under way. And when Senegal kicks off its campaign against the Netherlands tonight, its players and fans will be hoping to build on their biggest-ever achievement from earlier this year. .Newsreel: Mane….Mane…..Senegal are African champions. .Halla Mohieddeen: Winning the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time was a massive moment for the country, but it was extra special because the team’s coach, Aliou Cisse, is Senagalese as well. That’s not something that’s always been the case. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .For years, many African teams have relied heavily on Western coaches – appointments that have often come at the expense of local coaches across the continent. .Newsreel: Frenchman Herve Renard was named as head coach of the Morocco national football side. .Newsreel: Egypt have hired seasoned Portuguese coach Carlos Quieroz as the new head coach of the country’s men’s football team. .Halla Mohieddeen: But change may be afoot. As Aliou Cisse leads his own country at the tournament, he’s not the only one. All five African teams in Qatar – Morocco, Ghana, Tunisia, Cameroon and Senegal – have African coaches at the helm. That’s something that’s never happened before in the history of the World Cup. So, is Qatar 2022 a turning point for African coaches? I’m Halla Mohieddeen, and this is The Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Sean Jacobs: The Nigerian writer Chimamanda Adichie once said that the World Cup is a perfect vehicle for fostering Pan-Africanism. .Halla Mohieddeen: That’s Sean Jacobs, an assistant professor of International Affairs at the New School in New York, who’s originally from South Africa. .Sean Jacobs: She said if Nigeria loses or is not participating in the World Cup, I support Ghana. If Ghana gets knocked out, I move on to the teams that are remaining. So it’s a kind of nationalism that expands as your country’s losing, and in the process it fosters the Pan-Africanism that comes with the World Cup. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that sense of Pan-Africanism is why many across the continent are celebrating the representation of African coaches at this World Cup. It’s also why I’m talking to Sean. As the founder of the website Africa is a Country, and a massive football fan, I can think of few better people to get into this topic with. .Halla Mohieddeen: Sean, this World Cup marks the first time that all participating African teams will be coached by African coaches. All five of them, in fact, by coaches from that country. How significant would you say this? .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Sean Jacobs: I mean, it’s quite significant. In many of the cases, some of these teams, they’ve had an African coach or a national coach from the country leading the team to the World Cup before. However, to have all the coaches, I mean all five coaches come from the countries they’re coaching, that’s an incredible achievement. Secondly, it also just reflects well because we’re also living in a time in which people are questioning this reliance on European expertise, or the idea of European expertise as the gold standard, when in fact you have former African players and African coaches that have the qualifications and the experience. And so more and more people are asking, you know, why can’t they lead the national team? .Halla Mohieddeen: Well this has been an ongoing debate in African football circles for a while, hasn’t it? You know, should we be so reliant on foreign or Western coaches, or should we use local coaches instead? Do you think that national football federations in Africa have fallen into some kind of trap of thinking they need to be so reliant on foreign coaching? .Sean Jacobs: There are a lot of reasons why African national football federations appoint foreign coaches. I think one is a sort of holdover from colonialism, in which you are made to believe that the best expertise is coming from Europe. And secondly, because of Europe’s domination in football – the quality of football, the investment, the symbolism associated with European football clubs – that’s where you wanna play. .So that also means that like any other fan in the world – whether in South America, Asia, North America – you believe that the best players, the best coaches come from Europe. And I think definitely, there’s some racism involved here. If you are perpetually being told that those are the best coaches, you’re going to start believing it. If you’re not seeing people that look like you, then you’re also just going to follow that. .But all the evidence suggests that when African countries have had success – for example in the Africa Cup of Nations, when Egypt have won the Africa Cup of Nations seven times, and they’ve done so mostly with local coaches. .Newsreel: That’s it. Egypt are the Africa Cup of Nations champions.  .Sean Jacobs: The same goes for Ghana. They’ve won the Africa Cup of Nations with local coaches. .[SOUND OF GHANA WINNING] .Sean Jacobs: So I think with social media, with the increasing role of the diaspora of a particular country. In the case of Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana, you’ll see that the diaspora plays a larger role in debates about the country’s future. And Ghana, for example, appointed a coach who is born in Germany, but identifies with a very large Ghanaian diaspora in Germany. .Newsreel: The Ghana Football Association has officially announced Coach Otto Addo as the new head coach of the Black Stars.  .Sean Jacobs: So did Morocco, they took a coach who is of Moroccan descent but born in France. .Newsreel: World Cup-bound Morocco have appointed Walid Regragui as the new national team coach.  .Sean Jacobs: And former players, people with wide experience in global football – particularly in European football – are beginning to say, hey, look, we have this wider community, we have the expertise and we can rely on it. So, it’s time for change I would say. .Also the success of someone like Aliou Cisse, who’s the coach of Senegal. If you take him, he took the team to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations, then he won the Cup of Nations. And at the same time, he also qualified them twice for the World Cup. .And so the success of somebody like Cisse shows that you can appoint African coaches for the World Cup. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen:  One of the coaches Sean mentioned there was Ghana’s. His name is Otto Addo. Some in Ghana have criticised Addo for taking on the head coaching role on a part-time basis while remaining based in Germany, where he was born. .Newsreel: We are going there with a part-time coach. Are you kidding me? in this day and age? Hell no. .Halla Mohieddeen: But Mas-Ud Didi Dramani, one of Ghana’s assistant coaches at the World Cup, and a former player himself, says the connection that Addo has to Ghana is strong. .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: Otto is a Ghanaian. And Otto has played for Ghana. He’s very passionate about his contribution towards Ghanaian culture and Ghanaian football. .Halla Mohieddeen: And it’s not just Addo who is local, but most of the coaching staff. .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: I’m Ghanaian. I’m currently based in Ghana. I’ve coached Kotoko, the biggest club in Ghana. .I’ve won everything that is important. .[SOUND OF KOTOKO WINNING] .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: So I understand the culture of the Ghanaian player. I’m part of them. .Halla Mohieddeen: That’s a characteristic Didi says is invaluable – and not something all foreign coaches are able to bring to the table. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: It’ll be difficult for him to understand the cultural integration. I don’t have a problem when you have an expatriate working. I’ve been working with expatriates all of my life. And I appreciate the knowledge everybody brings along. But in the football industry these days, you need a unique identity. And this unique identity is cultural based. Because you can never say that because our players are playing in Europe, their behaviour will not have a resemblance of a Ghanaian, Moroccan, Senegalese culture. It’s not possible. They should still have it. So even if you are European, if you are really very culturally based, you think about what will you do to be able to understand these people properly so that you can get the best out of them. Getting down and then finding out, you know, where they’re coming from. What do they appreciate? How do they go about things? If you want to just be European, it will not work. You need to put yourself in the African context. .Halla Mohieddeen: The advantage of having a local coach can sometimes be as simple as being able to connect on a cultural or linguistic level. .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: I come from the northern part of Ghana, but speak so many Ghanaian languages. I speak Twi. I speak Ga. I speak Frafra. I speak Dagbani. I speak Gonja. I speak Fante. I speak Asante, you know. And based on that, I flow with them. Like Baba Iddrisu for instance. .Newsreel: Here is Iddrisu Baba for the Black Stars.  .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: I speak with him in my own dialect. Or Fatawu Issahaku. .Newsreel: Fatawu Issahaku! .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: I speak with him in Dagbani. And fortunately on my part, many of them are players that I have groomed in the youth teams. Because I coached the youth team also. .Halla Mohieddeen: This local know-how is something Sean says can be vitally important .Sean Jacobs:  I mean, it does matter for players often that the coach is local or is part of the diaspora, say in the case of Morocco, which had a Serbian coach that seemed to have difficulty communicating very well with the national team players. .Halla Mohieddeen: Those communication issues led to the coach dropping star player Hakim Ziyech from the team, which in turn led Ziyech to say he’d never play for Morocco again. .Hakim Ziyech: I will not return to the national team. It’s my final decision. .Halla Mohieddeen: But when the new coach, Walid Regraugui arrived, things changed. .Sean Jacobs: So when Walid came in as coach of Morocco, he brought Ziyech back in the national team in warm-up games. So it definitely brings back positive vibes within the national team. I think the best case always is that of Aliou Cisse. I mean, it’s very obvious that Cisse understands Senegalese football. He played in the team in 2002 that shocked the world where they beat France in the opening match of the World Cup. .[FRENCH COMMENTARY PLAYING] .They then go on to the quarterfinals. .Newsreel: And Senegal are through to the quarterfinals of the World Cup! .Sean Jacobs: And now he comes back and he becomes the national coach. And then with Senegal in particular, there was this idea that they could never win the Africa Cup of Nations. And then Cisse coaches them to that. So it does matter. The players respect him. They trust him. It’s not some obscure person that they don’t know. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Just looking back to some of the white European coaches that spent a lot of time coaching African teams. I mean, who were some of these guys? I mean, what kind of pedigree were you talking about? Were these just white guys getting jobs for being white? .Sean Jacobs: I mean, at some level it’s true that these are just white guys getting jobs for being white. But at another level, it has something to do with the structures of African football, with the history of African football. So you have a set of coaches who act almost like mercenaries, and if there’s a job available, they take it. And, you know, they’re often very good at what they do. However, it also turns out that there are just coaches – if you watch African football, you are like, where do these people come from? They coach in the lower leagues of one of the smaller European leagues, and you’re sort of wondering, you know, how did they get this job? .And sometimes, I mean, it has to do with the national football association being very weak. It’s controlled by a small group of people. There’s high levels of corruption. There’s a lot of political influence that result in a sort of lopsided way that the national association is organised and who they pick as a coach. .Halla Mohieddeen: And as Sean points out, despite their supposed expertise, many foreign coaches have ultimately failed to take African teams to glory. .Sean Jacobs: In many cases, it was the local coach that qualified you for the World Cup. Then that coach gets fired and a foreigner gets appointed at the last minute. And then, you know, it all falls apart during the tournament. And so I think lessons have been learned that maybe it’s time to appoint these local coaches. I think we’ve reached a point where people look at this and just go, it’s not just a great idea just to go find a mercenary and put them in position. .Halla Mohieddeen: Though it’s clear that Qatar 2022 is a landmark moment for African coaches – plenty of impediments still remain to them consistently getting high-level jobs in global football. More on that after the break. .Halla Mohieddeen: Though African coaches are taking centre stage at Qatar 2022, Sean says it’s unlikely this means they’ll start getting hired to take top head coaching jobs in Europe. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Sean Jacobs: There’s never actually been an African coach who was born, grew up, played in African leagues, coached in African leagues, who goes on to become a head coach at a top European club. And racism plays a part in this. Hiring people that look like you. It’s very clear, even for example in England, where you have many black English players who are capable coaches – that they’re finding it hard to even get a job in any of the leagues within the English professional setup. So even within Europe, they’re not even hiring people that are essentially European. .Halla Mohieddeen: Hmm .Sean Jacob: Like you’re black and European and you’re having a hard time of getting hired – how hard do you think it is to see an African coach from Africa getting a chance to get hired by a European club? .Halla Mohieddeen: Still, some African coaches are trying to make their mark in Europe. But they usually have to have the pedigree of having been a player who made a name for themselves on a global stage. That’s something Radhi Jaidi certainly did, having represented Tunisia over a hundred times, even scoring a goal in the 2006 World Cup .Newsreel: Radhi Jaidi from Bolton Wanderers in England, steals into the six-yard area and Tunisia…. .Radhi Jaidi: It was great feeling, you know. I’m still buzzing about it until now. Scoring goals in the World Cup, it’s a dream come true for me. .Halla Mohieddeen: Radhi also played in the English Premier League, watched by 3.2 billion people worldwide – for teams such as Bolton Wanderers, Birmingham City and Southampton – where he eventually became the coach of the Under-23 youth team after his playing career. But Radhi says the kind of training he got as a coach in England, leading to certifications known as coaching badges, just simply isn’t available for young coaches in Africa. .Radhi Jaidi: When I started to think about being a coach, I thought okay, I finished my career as a football player. I’m going to go back to Tunisia. But we don’t have the right platform, a clear platform in Tunisia, to do my highest qualifications. The first question you ask yourself is how are you gonna develop as a coach? And then you don’t have answers. In Tunisia of course, information is not there. Even when I was a player, I asked questions but there is no answers. Answers are really ambiguous. There is no clear communication about how we develop. I had a lot of young coaches from Tunisia asking how I can get this qualification? And this diploma? And this development? They’re trying to get the information, but there is no real and clear platform to support these coaches. .Halla Mohieddeen: Since coaching at Southampton, Radhi has been a head coach for clubs in the United States and in Tunisia. He’s also been an assistant coach for the Belgian club, Cercle Brugge, where he’s currently working for a second time. Radhi knows he wouldn’t have got these opportunities if he hadn’t played in England. .Radhi Jaidi: So my path was different. I moved to England since 2004. I played Premier League. I was lucky that in England you will be part of the PFA. The player’s federation and association. So, they will provide you the advice and the support on what it is next, especially after the career. And they propose you ideas. In Tunisia, we don’t have this. So when I decided to retire, everything was planned for me to prepare my coaching badges. At the same time I started to practise as a coach in Southampton Academy. I was lucky because, you know, Southampton is one of the best academy in Europe, which include the best staff and expertise around. I had my own mentor and I had my own experts around me, not just coaches, but from all other multidisciplinary departments. And this has helped me to build a great base. I’m still progressing, but I had the platform to progress with my dream. We don’t have this in Africa. .Halla Mohieddeen: Didi Dramani, the assistant coach for Ghana we spoke to earlier, is also one of the few African coaches with experience in Europe, having worked as an assistant for FC Nordsjaelland, in the Danish Superliga. And Didi hopes that seeing coaches like him in Europe makes a difference for young coaches in Africa. .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: My dream has always been to coach in Europe. And so when the opportunity came, I rather thought about what would I do to be able to influence Africans on European soil. I inspire and then I impact a lot to the Ghanaian coach, and the Ghanaian young player. I mentor a lot of coaches in Ghana. In a day, I speak to more than a hundred coaches. I was in FC Nordsjaelland from late 2017 and I left just last year and went back. I said I should go back to go and impact. .Halla Mohieddeen: Didi also believes more African coaches and players in Europe will impact the way African football is viewed internationally. .Mas-Ud Didi Dramani: The presence of me over the years, and the influence of the African player into the Danish league really influenced the development of Africa football. And I believe that that is what is happening in Senegal. That is what is happening in Tunisia. That is what is happening in Cameroon and Morocco. It changes the way people are thinking about Africa. Now we have coaches in Europe, and we have our players, young talent, doing very well and coming to impact clubs in Europe. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: But despite their experiences, neither Didi nor Radhi have been given a head coaching role of a senior team in Europe. It’s something Radhi says is still a big barrier to break through, even though he has a UEFA Pro License, the highest certification available in Europe. .Radhi Jaidi: For someone who’s dreaming to be a Premier League coach, one of the challenges I’m facing now after finishing my qualification, is seeing a lot of competition and a lot of coaches, especially local coaches who go above you. Even sometimes with less experience and less development or qualification, and get that senior job. I’ve been dreaming all my time to get a senior job – a head coach. But never happens. So if you are an African coach and a former player who has been lucky like myself, being in Europe – you need to be at your best. You need to be the best in everything you touch, to get that job. And even with that, they will find a way, you know, to put you in a second line. So you need to be at your best baby, to get that job in Europe. You have to be perfect. You have to be unbelievable to take that job. I can’t imagine an African coach coming from Africa without all the qualification, all this development, and then easily going to Europe and getting a job. I wish I would see it, but I can’t imagine that. .Halla Mohieddeen: He can’t imagine it, because he’s been told as much. .Radhi Jaidi: A very big football director in a big club in Europe told me, Radhi, “we will never take an African coach from Africa to take this job”. And for me, it was an eye-opener to be fair. Because before that I thought, why not? Because African coaching can be successful if you give them the right support or the right platform. .Halla Mohieddeen: In the face of these impediments, Radhi still has questions about the path forward for an African coach in Europe. .Radhi Jaidi: It’s like okay, can I find a hybrid way where a former player like myself go and develop from a young age to reach the level where he can take a senior coach job? Apparently not. That’s not working, because I did that. I tried it. There is a little bit of frustration, but I’m positive about myself. I’m confident as well. I have a lot of energy, a lot to give back to football as a football coach. I’m patient in that aspect, so I have all the ability to take a head coach role. So I’m waiting for that and working hard to get the right opportunity. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s the Take.

496,Published On 21 Nov 2022,"‘Say her name, Mahsa Amini’: Iran protests arrive at World Cup",Iran football fans use the Iran-England match to raise their voices in support of those protesting in their country.,".Doha, Qatar – Chants of “Say her name, Mahsa Amini,” reverberated among protesters outside Khalifa International Stadium ahead of Iran’s first match of the World Cup 2022 against England. .A few dozen men, women and children were seen on Monday wearing t-shirts saying “Zan, Zindagi, Azadi” (women, life, freedom), a famous chant from the protests in Iran. .Protests have been taking place across Iran since mid-September after the death in custody of Amini, a 22-year-old woman from Iran’s Kurdistan province. Amini was arrested by the country’s morality police in the capital Tehran for allegedly not adhering to Iran’s dress code for women. .In the past few days, protests have been most intense in northwestern Kurdish-majority provinces, with videos continuing to come out from several cities, including Mahabad, Bukan and Piranshahr in West Azerbaijan and Javanrud in Kermanshah. .“My people in Iran are under a lot of pressure and are being killed by the regime, so we want to use this opportunity to raise a voice for them,” Mahmoud Izadi, one of the protest organisers, told Al Jazeera in Qatar’s capital Doha. .The protests started off with claps and chants of “Iran” but soon turned political as a charged-up crowd started waving banners with Amini’s picture on them. .Dressed all in black to register his protest, Izadi said the demonstrators want the world to pay attention to the situation in Iran and are using the World Cup as a platform because their voices are being crushed in their home country. .Once those protesters went quiet, a group of men in Iran football shirts began shouting in support of the team. .“People who are dancing and cheering for Iran have been sent here by the regime to paint a different picture,” Izadi said, adding that he was not there to support the team “because they are not supporting our people”. .The most vocal protesters seem to be those who have travelled to Qatar from places other than Iran. .Others, who seemed to be based in Iran or will travel there, were simply clapping from the sidelines and steered away from any attention. .A few families and women turned down requests for a comment, saying they wanted to stay away from trouble back home. .Hasti, an Iranian-born American here to watch Iran’s matches, said she does not think a sports tournament is necessarily the best place to register a protest but there are not many options left for the people of her country. .“We are going to use whatever platform we can get to raise the issue and this may not help the people in Iran directly but it will help show the world what’s happening there.” .Amidst the chants, a group of people held up a poster of former Iran footballer Ali Karimi who has been supporting the protests. .Karimi left the country soon after the protests broke out in Iran. .“The regime was after his life and he has been on the run since then,” said Izadi. .Abi Shams, donning a green t-shirt that says “Help free Iran,” has flown in from the US and says his choice of outfit is aimed at attracting attention. .“What we have in Iran is a dictatorship and we, the protesters, are the voice of the Iranian people,” he said. .As the crowd built up outside the stadium entrance, people started making their way through the turnstiles. The protesters, however, stayed behind for one last round of chanting and clapping and say they do not plan on stopping anytime soon. .“We have reached a point of no return and will no longer be suppressed by the regime,” said Izadi, before joining a chant of “zan, zindagi, azadi”.",496

That was what we did as kids. Football is the most watched sport, participated sport in the country,” he said. .The quick-witted al-Amari, who speaks English with a distinctive Irish lilt having lived in Ireland for many years, remains unfazed by the criticism that has been levelled at Qatar in the build-up to the tournament. .“I don’t think any other country has been exposed to the things that Qatar has been exposed to in the media,” he said, “and it’s fine, we’re doing it anyway. It’s happening.” .“It is our responsibility as Qataris to showcase our culture and bring people in, and that’s exactly what we are doing,” he said.",497
498,Published On 21 Nov 2022,Seven European teams ditch ‘OneLove’ armband World Cup plan,U-turn comes after FIFA threatens to hand out yellow cards to players taking part in the initiative.,".Seven European teams have abandoned plans for their captains to wear rainbow-themed armbands at the World Cup after FIFA threatened to issue yellow cards to any players who did so. .The climbdown came just hours before England’s Harry Kane, the Netherlands’ Virgil van Dijk and Wales’ Gareth Bale were due to wear the “OneLove” armbands in Monday’s group-stage games. .Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and Germany had also originally planned to take part in the campaign, which backers said was aimed at promoting inclusion. .But the seven football associations said in a joint statement that they couldn’t sacrifice success on the field for the initiative, which had also been widely viewed as a protest against laws in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. .“FIFA has been very clear that it will impose sporting sanctions if our captains wear the armbands on the field of play,” the associations said in a joint statement. .The European plans were in breach of World Cup regulations and FIFA’s general rules on team equipment at its games. .“For FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA,” the governing body’s equipment regulations state. .The associations said they had written to FIFA in September to notify the Switzerland-based organisation of their plans involving the “OneLove” armband but had not received any response. .They added they had been prepared to “pay fines” that would typically apply to breaches of kit regulations, but could not put their players “in the situation where they might be booked, or even forced to leave the field of play”. .The risk of getting a second yellow, which would see a player sent off the field for the rest of the game and banned from the next, is particularly tricky in a tournament where teams play only three games before the knockout rounds begin. .“We are very frustrated by the FIFA decision, which we believe is unprecedented,” the football associations’ statement said. .The developments attracted swift and scathing criticism from groups representing the LGBTQ community and rights groups. .“More than disappointing that @FIFAWorldCup and @FIFAcom silence & deflection means European captains face starting games with yellow cards for trying to highlight issues around human rights,” 3LionsPride, a group representing England fans, tweeted. .“Their basic rights to freedom of speech & expression being crushed by FIFA.” . .England’s Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) said it felt contempt for FIFA. .“To paraphrase FIFA president Gianni Infantino – today LGBT+ football supporters and their allies will feel angry,” it said, citing his monologue on the eve of the tournament aimed at media criticising the decision to stage the World Cup in Qatar. .“Today we feel betrayed. Today we feel contempt for an organisation that has shown its true values by giving the yellow card to players and the red card to tolerance.” .Amnesty International said FIFA was failing to uphold its own values and responsibilities. .“Sport does not happen in a vacuum and these are issues on which FIFA should be leading, not cracking down on,” Steve Cockburn, Amnesty’s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said. .“Agreements on armbands, and better protections for LGBTI communities, should have been reached a long time ago. We applaud the courage of teams and players who have spoken out about human rights and we hope they continue to do so,” he added. .FIFA launched its own captain’s armband campaign ahead of the tournament to promote different causes for each round. .On Monday it said had brought forward its own “No Discrimination” from the planned quarter-finals stage in order that all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear its own armband during the tournament. .“This is in line with Article 13.8.1 of the FIFA Equipment Regulations, which state: ‘For FIFA Final Competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA’,” the football governing body said in a statement. .Some, including former England footballer Stan Collymore, called for the national sides to disregard FIFA’s position and instead make a stand and have their captains wear the armbands. . .But German Football Association president Bernd Neuendorf said it was unfair for the players to shoulder the responsibility for any potential consequences if they decided to wear it anyway. .“We are witnessing a case with no precedent in World Cup history,” Neuendorf said. .The criminalisation of same-sex relations in Qatar has been a long-running controversy in the build-up to the World Cup. .Former Qatari international footballer and World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman sparked outrage earlier this month after calling homosexuality “damage in the mind” during an interview with a German media outlet. .Qatar has repeatedly stated that everyone was welcome to attend the tournament.",498

500,Published On 21 Nov 2022,Argentina or Brazil? Football fans in India hedge their bets,"India may be cricket-crazy, but in the southern state of Kerala football is followed with religious fervor.",".Kozhikode, India – The World Cup has come to a football-crazy southern Indian city, where Lionel Messi, Neymar and other star players are, quite literally, larger than life. .In Kozhikode, in the southern state of Kerala, fans have celebrated international football’s greatest event for years. Gigantic cut-outs of players are on display across the city on India’s western coast, along with fluttering flags and banners. Almost every street has some kind of adornment, as residents express their love for the game. .Argentina and Brazil have always garnered huge support here, associated as the teams are with the exploits of legendary names such as Kaka (Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite), Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho Gaúcho and Diego Maradona. .Muhammad Basith, aged 28, a businessman and a Brazil fan since the late 1990s believes the support for Brazil has increased since 1998 but the fervour for Argentina is more deep-rooted. .He fondly remembers when he began watching football in 1998, his father bringing home a small colour TV  just before Mario Zagallo’s side reached the final of the World Cup that year. .“Brazil’s performances in that tournament began my story of supporting them. I remember that the TV that my father bought had a switch shaped like a football. That TV is still preserved at my home somewhere as a memory,” Basith told Al Jazeera. .The flags of Argentina and Brazil fly high in the city. Even in the neighbouring district of Malappuram,  former and current football greats feature prominently on billboards. Maradona is often depicted as a guiding god-like figure overseeing manager Lionel Scaloni’s team. .“A lot of younger fans support Brazil because Argentina have not won the World Cup since 1986. But the support for Argentina is much deeper,” Basith said. .“People do like to portray stars as larger-than-life characters in Kerala and that also applies to film stars. But footballers connect with them on a different level, especially those from Brazil and Argentina.” .The seven-a-side football culture has grown in Kerala and there are pitches across Kozhikode, where the wet weather and muddy terrain create perfect conditions for play. .It is no wonder that street footballers who became masters of the game have a special place in the hearts of fans here. .“Kerala is not the most urbanised state in India. This means that there is a lot of empty space and when the crops aren’t planted, those spaces become imperfect football pitches for kids and teenagers. Not being extremely urbanised means that people generally have more free time on their hands,” Basith said. .Maradona, Lionel Messi, Brazilian Ronaldo and Neymar started playing on the streets where they grew up, and fans in Kerala feel that down-to-earth connection. .Bilal Ahmed, a businessman in Kozhikode and a football fan, said: “The pitches are used in the morning and in the evening. Since the economy in the area is reliant on fishing, people have time to commit to football.” .Football’s ease of access and lack of complexity creates early adopters. “We only need a ball. Cricket needs more time and resources. There is no space or condition to play cricket here, as there is too much sand. That makes football very easy to play,” Ahmed said. .Pullavoor, a village on the outskirts of Kozhikode, created a stir on social media with its soaring cut-outs of Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo. .Irshad PK, a member of the Argentina Pullavoor fans group, said: “We enjoy it and we support Argentina because they play great football. It is part of our lives.” .Installing the Messi cut-out was a tedious task that took several hours, he said. . .The one of Neymar was placed a few metres ahead of Messi’s on the Cherupuzha River. .A closer look revealed five smaller cut-outs floating around the image of the Paris Saint-Germain star, to represent the number of World Cup trophies that Brazil have won. . .Football and the World Cup are also a source of cash in Kozhikode, as fans snap up flags and jerseys. Television sales and broadcast subscriptions also go up – with a corresponding increase in advertisements during the World Cup. .It is not just about South America. The flags of Spain, Germany, France and England can also be seen on the streets of beachfront areas such as Vellayil and Beypore at the Kozhikod. Rival hoardings and flags make the streets a battleground for fan support. .Basith described football as a uniting cultural force. .“In other places, children are gifted video games and mobile phones.

502,Published On 21 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Senegal vs Netherlands match preview,Africa’s highest-ranked team will still look to challenge the Netherlands in the opening clash despite injury to star player.,".Senegal and the Netherlands will head into their opening World Cup fixture high on confidence after a string of promising recent performances. .In February, the Teranga Lions secured their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title after beating Egypt on penalties. .The Netherlands have also enjoyed considerable success in their continental exploits, topping their Nations League group and notching two morale-boosting wins against their Benelux rivals, Belgium. .Monday’s match will likely represent the greatest challenge in Group A for both teams, who will fancy their chances against Ecuador and Qatar, ranked 44th and 50th in the world, respectively. .The contest at Al Thumama Stadium had promised to pit Liverpool’s mercurial centre-back Virgil van Dijk against his former teammate and prolific goalscorer Sadio Mané. However, this year’s Ballon d’Or runner-up picked up a leg injury playing for German champions Bayern Munich and has been ruled out of the tournament, in a big blow to the African champions that has left its supporters in shock. .“We know that we have lost a great leader but I think that there will be more players that will show themselves and we must be ready,” defender Kalidou Koulibaly said. .Midfielder Nampalys Mendy agreed. .“We have to be ready, ready before any eventuality, it’s true that the absence of Sado will harm us enormously … because he is an important player. We have players of great quality too, so we are confident in our quality, and we will do everything to show it.” .Still, Micky Jnr, a football journalist specialising in African football, expressed confidence that “this Senegal team will progress from the group”. .He expects Senegal to claim, at least, a point against the Netherlands, or “maybe surprise the Europeans with a win”. .At the back, both teams boast several world-class options. Van Dijk is joined by the likes of Inter Milan’s Stefan de Vrij and Bayern Munich’s Matthijs de Ligt for the Oranje. Senegal can rely on Chelsea’s Koulibaly and RB Leipzig’s Abdou Diallo. .In between the sticks, Senegal seemingly have the upper hand with Chelsea’s Edouard Mendy. .Even though the keeper has struggled for form this season, his international experience far outweighs what the Netherlands offers. Dutch manager Louis van Gaal has yet to settle on his number one, but in the past two matches, he handed Ajax shot-stopper Remko Pasveer his first international caps at the ripe age of 39. .In midfield, the Oranje boast the likes of Frenkie de Jong and the free-scoring Cody Gakpo, who continues to light up the Dutch Eredivisie with 13 goals and 15 assists in 24 games so far this season. .“It is going to be a cagey game; I think the battle will be won in midfield,” says Jnr, who highlights Senegal’s Pape Matar Sarr, a talented footballer with an “excellent work rate” as someone to look out for. .Senegal have some exciting options in attack, such as Boulaye Dia, who is currently on loan to Serie A side Salernitana from Villareal. .However, Mané will be a huge loss for Senegal, boosting the Netherlands’ chances. .“We have players who play at the highest level, the biggest clubs in the world. We have experience. We have talent. We have a good mixture. But first and foremost, we have team spirit. And I think that’s the start and the key to success. It’s not guaranteed success, of course, but it’s a good way to start,” van Dijk said on Thursday, while also hailing van Gaal’s leadership. .“We have a fantastic manager, experienced manager,” he added. .“It’s going to be a very big one against the African champions and we’ll do everything in our power to hopefully get a good result and start our World Cup in the best way possible.”",502

When: Monday, November 21 (4pm local time, 13:00 GMT)
Rankings: England (5), Iran (20)
Head to head: First match
Last five matches: England LDDLL, Iran LWLWD .The first game of perhaps the most politically charged group pits England against Iran at the 40,000-capacity Khalifa International Stadium on Monday. .Given the historically fraught relations between the two countries, the only chance of the football teams facing off would have come in a global tournament and they managed to avoid each other until now. .In addition to the political tension between Iran and its three Western group members, all four teams sit in the top 20 of the rankings, giving it the dreaded moniker of “Group of Death”. .England are favourites to progress from the group based on their ranking, previous results and tournament history. However, Gareth Southgate’s team have lost three and drawn three matches in their UEFA Nations League fixtures this summer that led to their relegation. .Southgate has named a strong 26-man squad for the World Cup, and will hope his top performers from last year’s Euro run will make a comeback to their best form. Captain Harry Kane will lead the attack with the likes of Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka. Jordan Henderson, Jude Bellingham and Mason Mount make up for a strong midfield as well. England’s problems, however, have been in defence where Southgate has not been able to stop them from leaking goals. .Iran will look to exploit this weakness with star striker Mehdi Taremi at the front of the attack, supported by Sardar Azmoun and Alireza Jahanbakhsh. .Iran’s Portuguese Coach Carlos Queiroz will look to employ his defence-heavy tactics to contain the English attacking talent. Iran have had a decent run of results in recent friendlies with wins over Uruguay and Lebanon. .During the second stage of their World Cup campaign, Iran won eight of their 10 games and topped their group ahead of South Korea. While the qualification campaign was led by Croatian coach Dragan Skocic, supporters of Team Melli will hope the return of Queiroz before a global tournament will work in their favour. .Iran will hope to come away from their opening encounter with at least a point. And with the out-of-form USA and closely ranked Wales being the other two teams in the group, Queiroz’s team will have a chance of pulling off an upset and qualifying for the knockout round at the World Cup for the first time.",503

When: Monday, November 21, 10pm (19:00 GMT)
Head to head: USA won once (2-0), draw once .Group B could be one of the toughest and tightest at the World Cup in Qatar, with all four teams featuring in FIFA’s top 20 highest-ranked teams. .The USA v Wales game will kick off at the Ahmed Bin Ali stadium in Al Rayyan,  several hours after the final whistle in the first group game, between England and Iran. .The US team is returning to the competition after an eight-year absence, failing to qualify for the 2018 tournament hosted by Russia. That failure led to something of a reset in US football, with a group of young and technically gifted players entrusted to navigate a tricky CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football) qualifying campaign, and the team arrives in Doha full of confidence. .The team is led by Christian Pulisic, the most expensive North American football player in history. The 5’10” forward is the face of US football, and the team is built around his mercurial presence. .For Wales, the wait for an appearance at a World Cup goes back to 1958. Led by Gareth Bale, the team qualified after finishing second in their group and defeating Ukraine in a playoff. .When Bale is in form, he’s one of the fastest and most skilful footballers in the world. He currently plays his club football in the US, with the city of Los Angeles his latest stop in a stellar career featuring Champions League wins with Real Madrid, as well as 71 goals for Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League. .But Wales are more than a one-man team. Fellow veterans Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen provide solid midfield support. The three Welsh heroes have the weight of a nation’s expectations upon their shoulders, and that burden may prove too great as the tournament progresses. But the trio should be fresh and full of beans in their first game of the campaign, at least. .That said, the US team were unbeaten at home during their qualification run, even without some of their Europe-based players. Expect to see a repeat of their 4-1-4-1 formation with plenty of attacks from the wings on each flank. .With England expected to top Group B, this match could be crucial for the chances of Wales and the US to make it through to the final 16 in the runner-up spot.",504

There is no doubting the quality. A good atmosphere can be a good influence,” Rochet said. .“But when the time comes to work, we focus 100 percent on what we have to do.” .The Uruguay team have arrived in Qatar with a blend of youth and experience that has left some commentators believing they are one to watch at the World Cup. .After the South Korea match, two-time World champions Uruguay take on Portugal and Ghana in Group H. .The team’s Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani will take part in their fourth World Cup as the Uruguay squad look to win the trophy for the first time since 1950. .“You always dream and hope to reach as far as possible in the tournament, but we must go step-by-step,” Rochet said on Sunday. .“It is a very difficult group where any team is capable to beat any rival, so we must just focus on the road ahead thinking now about South Korea, and that’s our only focus,” he said. .“Then, after Korea, we will start thinking of Portugal and that’s the way to take each match with confidence because I think we have a very good team.”",505
506,Published On 21 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022 key events: Ecuador deal Qatar 2-0 loss in opener,The FIFA World Cup 2022 kicked off on Sunday. Here’s a quick guide recapping the main events from Day 1.,".After 12 years of preparations, the World Cup has gotten under way with the opening ceremonies kicking it off at Qatar’s Al Bayt Stadium on Sunday. .The 30-minute ceremony, narrated by Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman, featured performances from a star-studded cast of entertainers and singers, including K-pop sensation Jungkook of South Korean supergroup BTS and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi. .Fireworks lit up the night sky above the stadium located some 44km (27 miles) north of Qatar’s capital, Doha. .The ceremony’s theme was unity and inclusivity. .“Let this tournament be full of inspiring days of goodness and hope,” Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani told the crowd, as he welcomed the world to Doha. .Across the region, fans jam-packed cafés in Erbil, Iraq, crowded around TVs screens at pubs in Istanbul, Turkey, and filled a sports hall in Gaza City to witness the opening ceremonies — and the first World Cup match to be played on Middle Eastern soil. .With all eyes on diminutive and energy-rich Qatar, some were hopeful the spotlight could shatter stereotypes. .“I did not expect that one day an Arab country would host the World Cup,” Rasul Farid, 26, told Al Jazeera at a café in the city of Erbil in northern Iraq. .“It is a positive thing that the World Cup in an Arab country will give a different impression of us, away from stereotypes. I am here to support the Qatari team.” .Qatar and Ecuador took the field at 7pm local time(16:00 GMT). .Qatar underwhelmed in its first-ever World Cup match, losing 2-0 to an energised Ecuador led by Enner Valencia, who netted two unanswered goals on a penalty kick and later a header. .Just three minutes in, referees called back what appeared to be the match’s first goal, after a header from Ecuador’s Valencia rippled the mesh following a long-distance free-kick attempt by Pervis Estupinan at half-field. .The goal was ultimately disallowed by the video assistant referee (VAR). .Valencia later slipped his first goal past Qatari goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb on a penalty shot 15 minutes into the match. He then notched his second goal with a header from a cross just outside the box shortly before the end of the first half. .Qatar dominated possession in the second half. However, the home team struggled to capitalise on any fleeting momentum they had built, failing to land any of their five shots on goal throughout the match. .For Qatar, who now face an uphill battle in Group A, the loss notably marked the first time in the World Cup that a host team lost the opening match. .“Everything leading up to the game was great. But that performance was very bad,” one Qatar fan told Al Jazeera following the match. .  .Elsewhere in Doha, there were chaotic scenes at the FIFA fan festival in Al Bidda Park after tens of thousands of fans packed the venue, the Reuters and the Associated Press news agencies reported. .The venue, which has a capacity of 40,000 people, was overwhelmed by at least twice that number and police ultimately had to shepherd thousands of angered fans out of the holding area between the main festival park and the perimeter entrance. .“They let too many people in,” one fan holding a three-year-old child told Reuters. .“We never made it into the main area and I was glad to leave.” .Inside, boisterous fans draped in their country’s colours waved flags and lined up to pay $14 per glass of beer, with revellers limited to four per person. .“So far it’s been nice people, nice weather, nice everything,” Danish fan Emil Larsen told the Associated Press. .“And it’s been hard to find something to drink, you know, like a beer. But so far, so good.”",506
507,Published On 21 Nov 2022,"Industrial Area Fan Zone rocking with fan fervour, music and food",Migrant labourers say a ticket quota would have been a welcome gesture towards those who played important role in World Cup preparations.,".Doha, Qatar –  Excitement filled the air in the Industrial Area Fan Zone as thousands of migrant labourers came to watch the historic first game of the FIFA World Cup 2022 featuring Qatar and Ecuador in Qatar’s capital Doha. .Some arrived in their overalls, coming straight from work. Others had the day off, and there were those who had asked employers if they could skip work to watch the match. .Nearly all male, the bustling crowds of largely South Asian workers, as well as some from Africa, are the people who built the infrastructure that allowed the World Cup to take place. .On Sunday evening, they were more than ready to enjoy the game and appreciate the fruits of their labour. .Concerns about low wages, poor living conditions and worker safety issues in Qatar have been consistently raised by human rights groups and critics of the Gulf nation hosting the World Cup. .That criticism led to reforms in 2020, including Qatar abolishing the so-called no-objection certificate, which had forced workers to seek consent from their current employers before being allowed to switch jobs. Qatar has also introduced a minimum monthly wage of 1,000 Qatari riyals ($275). .The anticipation was palpable in the fan zone, which was set up in the neighbourhood where most of Qatar’s labour population lives. .“Here, I’m in the middle of it … and naturally thrilled,” 45-year-old Muhammad Hossein from Bangladesh told Al Jazeera at the fan zone in Doha’s Asian Town Cricket Stadium. .Hossein had worked on the construction of a Metro station in Doha – one of many infrastructure projects for the World Cup – and he is now employed there as a janitor. .Being part of the World Cup was a “big deal” personally and because it was the first time a Muslim country had hosted the tournament, he said, adding that he never thought he would “be part of something this important in this country”. .Though his home country is one of the world’s great cricket-playing nations, Hossein said he does not expect Bangladesh to replicate a similar success in international football, not any time soon, at least. .“My country has no chance in my lifetime … to qualify for the World Cup, or host it,” he said. .Qatar, which has a population of just some 2.8 million people, has become the first Middle Eastern and Muslim country to host the FIFA World Cup. Getting the country ready to hold the games was a herculean task – carried out mostly by overseas workers. .“Qatar did not have the Metro or the buses you see on the roads. All these buildings on Corniche, the highways and roads would maybe not exist if this giant event was not taking place,” Peter, a worker from India, told Al Jazeera. .“I am happy to say we [migrant workers] played a big role,” said the 48-year-old, who came to Qatar more than 15 years ago and works in an optical fibre-making company. .Before kick-off, the atmosphere was vibrant as people poured in and the delicious aromas of biryanis cooking at food stalls filled the air. .But once the referee’s whistle blew, all attention was on the giant video screen and Qatar, who were undoubtedly the crowd favourite. .Every possession or counterattack by a Qatari player brought huge applause from the thousands of fans watching. .Unfortunately, Qatar fell short and was two goals down in the first half, with the score ending 2-0 in favour of Ecuador. .Nevertheless, Pradeep from Mumbai, India, said he had “properly enjoyed” himself. The night would have ended better with a win for the hosts, of course, the 20-year-old said. .“We would have been celebrating on the streets,” he said. .The fans had cheered just as loud at the opening festivities before the game, from Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani’s speech to Korean BTS superstar Jungkook’s performance. .Many captured the opening ceremony on their camera phones, which would be sent to loved ones overseas and from who many have long lived apart as they work in Qatar. .The mood was lifted further by a DJ who spun many crowd favourites, including Panjabi MC’s classic Mundian to Bach Ke – a beat the crowd knows well and responded to. .Despite their delight at living in Qatar during the World Cup, nearly all those who spoke to Al Jazeera lamented the fact that most could not afford tickets to the actual games since their salaries were hardly more than 2,000 Qatari riyals ($550) per month. .Ticket prices started at 40 Qatari riyals ($11) and went as high as 800 Qatari riyals ($220) for the group matches – when the lottery opened earlier this year – while all knockout games are unavailable on the main buying or resale platform. .Peter said he had tried every few days to find the 40 riyal ($11) tickets, but gave up. .“Who will sell the cheap ones [tickets] now,” he asked. .Arvin Kumar, a colleague of Peter’s, had bought a ticket for the Netherlands vs Ecuador game which cost him 600 Qatari riyals ($165), despite taking home a salary of 1,100 Qatari riyals ($302). .“I know it’s a lot,” Arvin told Al Jazeera. .“I have to save for myself and the family in India … that’s why I’m here after all,” he said. .“But when will I get this opportunity again to watch the biggest of all World Cups?” .For Peter, setting aside tickets for the lower-paid migrants who helped build the infrastructure for the World Cup should have been considered. .People with large salaries had also bought up the cheaper tickets, he said. .“Preferably, FIFA and the government should have kept 10 percent of the tickets for low-income workers.”",507
508,Published On 20 Nov 2022,Fans across the Middle East celebrate historic World Cup moment,"From cafes in Erbil to pubs in Istanbul and stadiums in Gaza City, fans gathered as the World Cup kicked off in Qatar.",".Qatar marked its FIFA World Cup debut with a defeat to Ecuador on Sunday, but in becoming the first nation in the Middle East to host the tournament, it has inspired a wave of pride across the region. .From cafes in Erbil to pubs in Istanbul and stadiums in Gaza City, excited onlookers gathered around television screens ahead of the opening fixture of a tournament some hope will shatter stereotypes of the Islamic world. .At a café in the city of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, fans new and old sipped tea as they debated the merits of participating teams and reflected on world football’s grandest competition coming to Qatar. .Rasul Farid, 26, said he first watched a World Cup in 2010 when South Africa hosted the finals. .“I did not expect [in 2010] that one day an Arab country would host the World Cup,” he told Al Jazeera. “It is a positive thing that the World Cup in an Arab country will give a different impression of us, away from stereotypes. I am here to support the Qatari team.” .Khalil Ahmed, 29, said he first watched the international football fiesta in 2006 when it was held in Germany. .“I did not think that one day it would be in an Arab country. I thought that the World Cup was only for the West and America – not for us.” .Ali Kareem, 22, watched the opening match in Iskan, a traditional area in Erbil well-known for streaming football matches. His earliest memories of football are from 2007 when Iraq won the Asian Cup and he started celebrating in the streets with his father and friends. .“I love [football], and we are very happy that the World Cup is being held in an Arab country,” he said, adding that he would support Brazil. .In Turkey, football fans geared up to follow this year’s tournament despite the country’s national squad failing to qualify for the 32-team tournament. .In the heart of Istanbul’s buzzing Beyoglu district on Sunday evening, the Corner Irish Pub was packed with football fans watching the introductory match of the World Cup between Qatar and Ecuador. There was a mix of tourists and locals, and most people appeared to be rooting for Ecuador. .“We’ll show all [the matches] throughout the month in English,” Zafer, the pub’s manager, told Al Jazeera, adding that his money was on Argentina to win the cup. .Ersoy Ozdem, a veteran sports journalist, told Al Jazeera he would be supporting Argentina during the competition. He said that he believed the World Cup could be held in any country, but noted issues regarding the timing of the competition, coming mid-way through the European club season. .“The World Cup cannot be held in November in my opinion, because we aren’t used to it,” Ozdem said, adding that a particularly high number of players are currently injured and will be unable to play. .Tulay Demir, a Turkish journalist and writer who grew up in the Netherlands, is supporting the Oranje. .“Although I think that Brazil will win the cup, as someone who is half-Dutch I am very happy to know that my country is part of it,” Demir told Al Jazeera. Demir will head to the Netherlands this week and is planning to watch her team face off against Ecuador on Wednesday at her friend’s bar in the town of Dieren. .For Demir, it is very valuable that the World Cup is being held in a Muslim country, but she expressed her concerns regarding the primary controversy that has surrounded the event – the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar. .The Guardian newspaper has reported that 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in the country since 2010, when Qatar was awarded the World Cup. .The Qatari government has stated that these figures, provided by the respective country’s embassies, included deaths of people not working on World Cup projects.“The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population,” it said. .The government said there were 37 deaths between 2014 and 2020 among workers directly linked to the construction of World Cup stadiums, of which three were “work-related”. .“The World Cup being organised in this region is very prestigious, but the deaths of many guest workers have cast a shadow over it,” Demir said. .“The lives lost have greatly damaged Qatar’s image. It had a very good opportunity on its hands, and I don’t think they were able to make good use of it,” she added. .In the besieged Gaza Strip, an opening ceremony was held in Gaza City to mark the first day of the World Cup. .Hundreds of Palestinian fans and athletes gathered in the Palestine Stadium Hall, where the fans raised the Qatari and Palestinian flags amid cheers of support for the Qatari team. .Murad Badr, 42, said he came here today with his children as a fan, an athlete, and a sport enthusiast. .“I have been watching the World Cup since 1994. This is the first year it is hosted by an Arab country, and the hosting is wonderful. The preparations are impressive.” .Badr told Al Jazeera that Qatar has made great efforts in establishing stadiums and infrastructure. .“Today, we came to support Qatar and the rest of the four participating Arab teams: Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia.” .Abdullah al-Saqqa, 37, a Palestinian national table tennis player, told Al Jazeera that he was lucky to have visited Qatar three times before. .“From 2006 to 2022, between these years, there has been a quantum leap in the State of Qatar. Qatar is proving itself – its Emir, its government, and its people,” al-Saqqa said. .“Everyone sees that Qatar deserves this coronation and can deliver a message to the world that we, as Arabs and Muslims, are able to be on the side of the super international powers.” .Shahd Salouha, 23, was following the opening activities of the World Cup with great interest. .“I am so passionate about football that I listen to the matches on the radio if the electricity is cut off in my house. Sometimes, I look for a place outside the house so as not to miss matches,” she said. .Salouha says her favourite national team is Brazil, but she also likes Spain and Germany. .“I have been following the preparations for the World Cup for a whole year, and everything I see is very impressive. The museums, stadiums, and preparations are great,” she said. .“This is a source of pride for all of us as Arabs, and it gives us a sense of pride that this is an Arab and Muslim country with such great capabilities.” .Salouha also expressed her gratitude for Qatar’s supportive role in the Gaza Strip. .“It is known that Qatar is one of the most supportive countries for Gaza, so they have all the love and respect, and it is a great country in word and deed.” .Maram Humaid contributed reporting from Gaza City.

The BBC’s social media team also put out a four-minute Instagram video at about the same time, recalling the 1982 Gay Games, organised by former Olympians to highlight homophobia in sport. .When the channel switched to its programme broadcast from Qatar, hosts Gary Lineker, Alex Scott and Alex Shearer discussed the allegations levelled against the host country. .“It’s the most controversial World Cup in history and a ball hasn’t even been kicked,” said Lineker, a former England football captain, in his opening monologue. .“Ever since FIFA chose Qatar back in 2010, the smallest nation to have hosted football’s greatest competition has faced some big questions. From accusations of corruption in the bidding process to the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums where many lost their lives.” . .“Homosexuality is illegal here, women’s rights and freedom of expression are in the spotlight. Also the decision six years ago to switch the World Cup from summer to winter. .“Against that backdrop there’s a tournament to be played, one that will be watched and enjoyed around the world. Stick to football say FIFA, well, we will, for a couple of minutes at least.” . .  .In the 12 years since it was awarded the right to host the first World Cup in the Middle East, Qatar has reformed its labour laws, including abolishing the much-criticised kafala system and the exit permit system, which had been abused by unscrupulous employers. Qatar has also introduced a minimum wage and new regulations on working in heat as part of labour reforms. .In a report released this month, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said Qatar had made progress in its labour reforms — improving the working and living conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers — but said challenges in implementation remained. .World Cup organisers say that all fans, no matter their sexual orientation, are welcome in Qatar. .In Qatar’s conservative society, public displays of affection are frowned upon, not just those between LGBTQ couples. .A BBC spokesperson told Al Jazeera that: “Full build-up and coverage of the World Cup has been available across the BBC, including the opening ceremony on iPlayer.” .BBC host Gary Lineker fired back at critics, saying it was all a matter of timing and logistics, tweeting: “It was shown live in its entirety on @BBCiPlayer, BBC Sport website and red button. The timing of the opening ceremony was changed to an earlier time very recently and WSL was already confirmed on @bbcone. If you wanted to watch it, you could.” .The World Cup’s opening match and ceremony were brought forward by a day from FIFA’s original plan, with the move announced more than three months ago, in August.",509

A majlis is an area in a house or a separate building used for all sorts of gatherings, from daily lounging to more important events. .But now, with the World Cup in town, it has taken on a different theme: a football watch party. .The mostly middle-aged and older attendees at the majlis were there to watch Sunday’s opening match of the 2022 World Cup, Qatar v Ecuador. .In Qatar, they have been waiting for this moment for years. All across the country, in majalis just like this, Qataris tuned in to see themselves on the world stage. .Not that everyone was here for the game. .“Honestly, I’m not into football,” said Nasser Al Thani, who is here most days. “They’re all here for the game, but I’m here for the opening ceremony.” .The opening ceremony, with its display of Qatari history, took the guests back to their childhood. One moment, in particular, took them back when a video was shown of Qatar’s former Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani playing football in the desert in what the guests estimated to be the early 1970s. .“We used to play in the sands like this,” said Nasser Al Thani, the majlis visitor. “Barefoot, toes bleeding. When I see these old images, it reminds me of the old days. People were simpler and nicer then.” . .Al Thani and the other guests reminisced about their trips to the desert in their youth. .One of them, Mubarak al-Naeemi, used to play for the Qatari football teams Al-Rayyan and Al-Gharafa in the 1980s. He said that one of his teammates at the time was Hassan Afif, the father of the current star of the Qatari team, Akram Afif. .“I would play on the left wing; I was good, but Hassan could get the ball to anyone, wherever they were on the field,” al-Naeemi told Al Jazeera. . .Qatar conceded a goal early, setting the game’s tone. .So, instead of wasting their time by paying too much attention to what was a poor performance from the Qataris, the majlis guests returned to thinking about the changes they have seen in the last 20 years in Qatar, particularly since the World Cup was awarded to the Gulf country in 2010. .It is well-known that Doha has changed rapidly since then. But listening to the guests here, who saw that change, it is clear how radically different things are. .“Look at these metro stations,” said one of the guests, Sultan Johar. “Four floors underground. It’s amazing. We got the World Cup out of it, but even if we hadn’t, these changes would have been enough. When you get off at each stop, you see something new.” .Al Thani points out that the change has gone beyond the infrastructure and spread to the people. .“Let’s be honest, we didn’t have a strong sense of nationalism or national identity before,” said Al Thani. “The World Cup, this project, has helped build this. Now you even hear the other Arabs who have been raised here, they speak with a Qatari accent. They have started to feel that pride in living in Qatar.” .But that does not mean that this group welcomes all the changes. .They recalled that the Qatar of their childhood and adolescence was less developed, but people were hardier and could survive on their own. .And not just that, the weather was cooler, and rainfall was still rare but more plentiful than today, they said. .Now, as many World Cup guests have found out, the temperatures are warmer than they used to be. .“It’s climate change, and it makes us worry about the future,” said Johar. “We never understood things like conservation or protecting the environment. Now we go on trips to the desert and pick up the litter. We get it now but look at the trees. They’ve disappeared in some areas because of the lack of rainfall. And the animals we used to hunt, you have to go deep into the desert to find them now.” . .On the television, Qatar conceded a second and then showed little in the second half, with the game eventually ending 2-0 for Ecuador. .Most of the guests at the majlis had left long before the end of the games, and the jokes were already rolling into everyone’s phones, commiserating over the loss. .At the end of the day, the result was not too important for the guests here, but the symbolism of the arrival of such a significant event to their doorstep was. And yet, once this tournament is over, the majlis will carry on, and these friends will still gather, wondering how much more they will see their country change in the years to come.",510

514,Published On 20 Nov 2022,Hosts Qatar overwhelmed by Ecuador in opening World Cup match,Ecuador put two unanswered goals past Qatar for victory in the World Cup’s opening match.,".Al Khor, Qatar – World Cup hosts Qatar have had a disappointing start to their campaign, with a 2-0 defeat to Ecuador leaving them facing an uphill struggle to make it out of their group in their first-ever World Cup. .It looked like Qatar had conceded a goal within three minutes of kick-off in the match at the Al-Bayt Stadium in Al Khor on Sunday evening. .But a header from Ecuador’s Enner Valencia, from a long-distance free-kick attempt from Pervis Estupinan close to the halfway line, was struck off by the video assistant referee (VAR). .But it was only a temporary reprieve for Qatar, playing in front of Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, other Qatari royals, and several foreign leaders in a crowd of 67,372. .After just 15 minutes of play, Valencia was brought down in the box by Qatari goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb and the referee pointed to the spot without hesitation. Slotting in the penalty to the right of the keeper, Valencia became Ecuador’s all-time highest World Cup goal scorer. .Fifteen minutes later, Valencia again found the net – doubling Ecuador’s advantage with a header from a cross from just outside the box on the right. .With half an hour gone, Qatar were two-nil down, and had not even had a touch of the ball in the Ecuadorian box. .The hosts settled as half-time approached, but could not manage to convert increased comfort into much meaningful attacking play after the break. Ecuador were forced to keep their defensive shape tight as Qatar dominated possession in the second half. .With the game in the final quarter, the ailing double-goal scorer Valencia, the recipient of a few rough challenges, was substituted for Jose Cifuentes. Ecuador, who also face Senegal and the Netherlands in their bid to get out of this group, will hope their star player has not been seriously injured. .  .A few moments later, Ecuador’s Jeremy Sarmiento, with a little more than 10 minutes on the pitch after coming on for Romario Ibarra, nearly added a third with a curling strike in the 79th minute, but his show flew wide. .An 86th-minute effort could have made Mohammed Muntari a Qatari hero, and almost set Al Bayt alight when he received a long ball and tried to beat the keeper with a smashing volley, only to have the ball land on top of the netting. .Qatar, the only host nation to lose an opening match in the history of the World Cup, only had five shots in the match and none were on target. The team had just two touches inside the opposition penalty area. .Leaving the stadium, some Qatar fans were shellshocked by the result. .“So, so bad. Everything leading up to the game was great. But that performance was very bad,” Qatar fan Ahmed al-Darwish told Al Jazeera. .“I grew up watching football. I love football but that was disappointing. Really disappointing. The whole world was watching us.” .Qatar fan Ahmed Ibrahim looked forward to the coming matches. Qatar will now face Senegal in five days’ time, and the Netherlands on November 29. .“We need to be better prepared tactically,” he said. “We have stronger teams coming up.” .Writing by James Brownsell.

515,Published On 20 Nov 2022,FIFA earns record $7.5bn revenue for Qatar World Cup,The earnings from this World Cup cycle are $1bn more than those generated from the 2018 tournament in Russia.,".FIFA has earned an unprecedented $7.5bn in revenue through four years of commercial deals tied to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the governing body of football says. .The earnings, which FIFA revealed on Sunday to officials from more than 200 of its member nations, are $1bn more than what the organisation pulled in from the previous World Cup cycle leading up to the 2018 event in Russia. .The extra income was buoyed by commercial deals with this year’s hosts. Qatar Energy joined as a top-tier sponsor, and new third-tier sponsors include Qatari bank QNB and telecommunications firm Ooredoo. FIFA also added second-tier sponsor deals this year from financial platform crypto.com and blockchain provider Algorand, its first new American sponsor in more than a decade. .Key broadcast deals for this year’s World Cup were signed during Sepp Blatter’s presidency in two-tournament deals for the Russia and Qatar events. They included deals with Fox in the United States and Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports from 2011. .FIFA pays for host countries’ organising committees, prize money, travel and accommodation for teams and support staff. It also pays for a legacy fund to help develop the sport in the host country after the World Cup circus has left town. .The winners of the Qatar World Cup will receive $44m out of a total prize pot of $440m. .FIFA organises its accounts in four-year cycles around each World Cup. For the 2015-2018 cycle leading up to the Russian World Cup, the governing body brought in $6.4bn. It has used that cash to help member bodies through uncertainty in 2020 when national team football and World Cup qualifying games were almost entirely shut down. .The organisation’s revenues are likely to approach $10bn for the next four years, thanks to a new financial strategy for women’s football and the expanded 2026 World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, which will see 48 teams compete for the first time, up from the present 32. .FIFA has an almost blank slate for the 2026 edition with top-tier sponsors Coca-Cola, Adidas and Wanda the only deals currently extended. Separate sponsor deals for women’s football are being signed for the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.",515

517,Published On 20 Nov 2022,First direct Tel Aviv to Doha flight brings fans to World Cup,Qatar said flights are for World Cup fans and its position on Israel remains unchanged as both countries have no ties.,".The first direct commercial flight between Israel and Qatar landed in Doha ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, despite there being no diplomatic relations between the countries. .International football’s governing body FIFA said on November 10 that the special direct flights had been confirmed, and that Cyprus-based Tus Airways will be operating them for the duration of the month-long tournament. .On Sunday, the head of Israel’s Public Diplomacy Directorate, Lior Haiat, said at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv that “history has been made” with the “first direct flight from Tel Aviv to Doha”. . .FIFA claimed that “Palestinian ticket holders and media” would be “able to travel on these chartered flights with no restrictions”. But it was not immediately clear to what extent Palestinian residents of the Israeli-occupied West Bank or blockaded Gaza Strip would have access to the charter. .The arrangement would be subject “to Israel’s security requirements”, FIFA said. .Palestinian residents, both in the West Bank and in Gaza, face severe challenges in travelling abroad. Palestinians in the West Bank generally travel from Jordan as access to Ben Gurion Airport is strictly restricted. Those in Gaza do not have access to Israel or its airport, with very rare exceptions. .One of the passengers, Hadar Segal, 35, said that the flight was a “special and historic thing”. .He planned to watch England play Israel’s foe Iran, as well as the match between Argentina and Saudi Arabia, another Arab country that does not recognise Israel. .Israeli passport holders can usually only travel to Qatar on special visas issued for sports fixtures or conferences. There are no existing direct flights between the two countries. .Qatar has emphasised that its stance on normalising relations with Israel remains unchanged. It is linked to Palestinian statehood that is achieved through a two-state solution in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. .Its neighbours, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, established diplomatic ties with Israel under United States-brokered pacts in 2020.",517
518,Published On 20 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Capitalism can’t kill football — try as it might,"The passion of fans globally for the Qatar World Cup is evidence, as is the legacy of Maradona and Garrincha.",".A week or so before the kickoff of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, I was walking in the coastal city of Zihuatanejo in Mexico’s southern Guerrero state when I passed a group of children playing football with a plastic Coca-Cola bottle. They were as gleefully animated as any group of children playing football anywhere, while the Coke bottle was, I thought, regrettably appropriate in a world governed by corporate toxicity. .It was particularly appropriate, perhaps, given that Coca-Cola and football go way back. The company, which has been an official World Cup sponsor since 1978, entered into a formal association with FIFA in 1974 – although its logo has saturated World Cup events since 1950. The partnership was initially ostensibly meant to promote youth development programmes, since there is clearly nothing better for youth development than ingesting sticky brown liquid that is bad for human health. .Of course, that alliance is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of global capitalism’s efforts to suck the soul out of football and eradicate any remnants of primordial joy by monetising and commodifying everything on and off the field. Given the deluge of corporate propaganda that we call “sponsorship”, the uninitiated football spectator would be forgiven for thinking Adidas was a football team – or that matches are waged between Emirates and Etihad airlines. .And there’s nothing like sponsoring football’s biggest competition to improve one’s international branding. Chinese firms have also caught on – they’re leading in spending for the Qatar World Cup. .In his book, El Fútbol a sol y sombra (Football in sun and shadow), first published in 1995, the renowned Uruguayan writer and die-hard football fan Eduardo Galeano remarked how every footballer had become an “advertisement in motion”- though not everyone was happy with that arrangement. In the mid-1950s, he recalled, when the prominent Montevideo club Peñarol had endeavoured to impose company advertising on its shirts, 10 members of the team had obediently taken to the field with the updated jerseys while Black player Obdulio Varela had declined: “They used to drag us Blacks around with rings in our noses. Those days are gone.” .To be sure, it’s never just fun and games when obscene quantities of money are involved. Take the case of Horst Dassler – the son of Adidas founder Adi Dassler, himself charmingly a former member of the Nazi Party – who in 1982 started a company called International Sports and Leisure, which promptly acquired exclusive marketing and TV rights to FIFA operations, including the World Cup. This was done by paying bribes to then-FIFA President João Havelange – the same Havelange who had graciously appeared alongside Argentine dictator Jorge Videla during the 1978 World Cup in Buenos Aires. .That dictatorship was ultimately responsible for murdering or disappearing some 30,000 suspected leftists in a seven-year dirty war that was green-lit by – who else? – the United States, which was always eager to have more maleficent right-wing regimes on board in its quest to make the world safe for capitalism. .In 1998, Havelange was replaced by Sepp Blatter, who has also been accused of rampant vote-buying and manipulation of financial data and who, according to Galeano, made Havelange look like “a Sister of Charity”. Galeano died in April 2015, a month before the US Department of Justice sensationally busted fourteen FIFA officials and corporate executives on corruption charges, with US Attorney General Loretta Lynch lamenting that the individuals had “corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves”. .But as the US well knows, corrupt self-enrichment and corporate impunity are business as usual in capitalism – which has also produced a “gentrification” of the sport itself, as researchers have shown. A study published by the Royal Society in December 2021 found that the “excessive monetisation of football” had led to increasing inequality between teams in major European leagues and a growing predictability of match outcomes. Even as those responsible for the sport’s governance claim to be globalising football, in reality, the process replicates the inequality endemic to corporate globalisation. .Indeed, the very spirit of professional football has been corrupted by the conversion of the sport into an industry – resulting in a regimented and technocratic game that aims to turn players into robots. As Galeano put it, this approach to football “forbids all fun”; in the interest of maximised productivity and increased profit, it “negates joy, kills fantasy, and outlaws daring”. Magic, after all, is not profitable. .Mercifully, however, there have always been folks who refuse to get with the programme. In Galeano’s view, Brazilian footballer Mané Garrincha, born into poverty in Rio de Janeiro in 1933, was hands-down the player who brought the most happiness to audiences in the entire history of football, turning the game into an “invitation to a party”. So much for the doctors who pooh-poohed the prospect of any athletic future for “this misshapen survivor of hunger and polio… with the brain of an infant, a spinal column like an S and both legs bowed to the same side”. (Capitalism won in the end, and Garrincha died, poor and alone, in 1983.) .Argentina’s football virtuoso Diego Maradona, also from the wrong side of the tracks, defied boundaries, too – including by denouncing the tyranny of television in sport, advocating for labour rights in football, demanding financial transparency from football clubs, supporting the Palestinian cause, and generally driving the powers that be up the wall. On the field, he continued injecting old-school magic into modern mediocrity until he was expelled from the 1994 World Cup. .Meanwhile, more recent resistance to football’s descent into soulless, money-driven depths was seen last year, when furious fans in the United Kingdom helped force the collapse of a Super League scheme designed to further line the pockets of elite club owners. .Sure, capitalism has certainly scored a major goal with professional football. .But the sport remains a source of popular passion and an affirmation of collective identity for countless people, on sports courts, grass pitches and dirt patches from Mexico to Mozambique – far from the billions of dollars swirling through the football industrial complex. .As the 22nd World Cup kicks off in Qatar today, Galeano would no doubt have criticised the whole televised spectacle. And yet he would have no doubt watched it on his TV, beer in hand, hoping for a glimpse of forbidden fun – a moment of unadulterated brilliance and beauty. Because as with the kids kicking the Coca-Cola bottle around Zihuatanejo, there’s something about football that capitalism just can’t kill. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",518
519,Published On 20 Nov 2022,Benzema’s injury pullout a blow to France World Cup chances,The Ballon D’Or awardee has been one of the world’s best strikers in recent years.,".France faced an uphill task in defending their World Cup crown after Karim Benzema was ruled out of the event on Saturday night. .The Real Madrid striker tore a muscle in his left thigh in training on Saturday. Benzema is the most recent addition to France’s injury list, which already included team regulars N’Golo Kante, Paul Pogba and Christian Nkunku. . .Benzema has been among the world’s most prolific scorers in recent years. Since Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure from Real Madrid in 2018, the Frenchman has taken on the mantle of being the team’s central attacking force and has significantly raised his game. .He scored a staggering 131 goals — nearly 33 a season — for the club between 2018-19 and 2021-22. He carried a below-par Real Madrid almost single-handedly to the La Liga title in the 2019-20 season, averaging nearly two goals a game. .At that stage, Benzema had not played for the national team since October 2015. But his club form made it impossible for France manager Didier Deschamps to exclude him from his plans. Benzema got out of purgatory last summer and was included in the French squad for Euro 2020, where he struck up a lethal partnership with Kylian Mbappe up front and scored four goals in the competition, including a brace against Portugal. .Last season was a seminal one for Benzema. He scored 44 goals in all competitions for his club and helped Real Madrid to the league title and Champions League glory. The Frenchman scored 15 goals in the Champions League, including successive hat-tricks against Chelsea in the round of 16 and Paris Saint-Germain in the quarterfinal. .The Ballon D’Or — awarded to the world’s top football player — he received last month was recognition of the level he had been consistently performing at for the past few years. But the injury on Saturday has ended his chance to seek an even bigger prize: the World Cup with France. .His team will be hurting too. Without one of the world’s best strikers, France will find it significantly harder to retain their title.",519

Maybe they count on the three points already. But we are here to show we can be a competitive team. We will bring our ‘A game’ and try to get good results that will bring so much joy.” .The team landed back in Doha seven days before kickoff, returning from an extensive training camp in Marbella, Spain. .“We want to show the results of all of our hard work. God willing, we will perform much better than any game before,” Qatar captain Hassan Al Haydos told the pre-match news conference. .The player to watch is tricky left-winger Akram Afif. The 25-year-old, who plays for Qatari side Al Sadd, was named Asian footballer of the year in 2019 after his one goal and 10 assists led Qatar to the continental trophy. .Even with home advantage, Qatar will not find it easy to overcome Ecuador. .With an average age of 25, the team nicknamed La Tri were the youngest team to qualify from South America and one of the youngest in the tournament. .Ecuador, ranked 44, had an impressive qualifying campaign, finishing fourth behind Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and losing just once at home. They smashed Colombia 6-1, beat Uruguay, took four points against Chile and drew with the football heavyweights Brazil and Argentina. .The star of the team is Moises Caicedo who plays for Brighton and Hove Albion, an English Premier League side. The 21-year-old box-to-box midfielder provides balance and defensive solidity to the young team. .If the Maroons are to pick any points against the La Tri, they will have to nullify his effective passing and penetrating runs. .Also keep an eye out for Gonzalo Plata, an exciting winger who plays for Real Valladolid in Spain. .Led by Argentinian Gustavo Alfaro, who often favours the 4-4-2 formation, La Tri will be looking to better their best-ever finish at a World Cup, when they reached the round of 16 in 2006.",521

523,Published On 20 Nov 2022,Qatar gears up for FIFA World Cup equity market boom,"Historically, equity markets of FIFA World Cup hosts have outperformed peers. Qatar is set to do the same.",".Doha, Qatar – Qatar is gearing up for a FIFA World Cup equity market boom as the country’s stock exchange is all set to benefit from the upcoming colossal event. .With more than $4bn of foreign inflows in the first 10 months of this year alone, equity market experts say that Qatar’s stock market, like most previous World Cup host markets, has outperformed peers in the run-up to the mega contest and is expected to continue along similar lines in the year after the tournament. .Historically, the average MSCI country stock market index of host nations of the previous seven World Cups, excluding outlier Brazil, grew by 21.8 percent in the year leading up to the World Cup and by 13.4 percent in the year after, compared with the MSCI World Index average growth of 4.3 percent and 9.5 percent respectively. .Brazil’s MSCI Index was an outlier and declined by 34 percent in the year after the final match in 2014. That drop was on account of domestic economic conditions, a political crisis and high inflation prevalent at the time, analysts say. .However, 2022 is proving to be an extraordinary year as stock markets bear the brunt of interest rate hikes by central banks attempting to fight inflation and turning off the supply of easy money that was started during the pandemic. Qatar’s stock market has not been immune to either. .The QSE Index, which measures the 20 largest and most liquid stocks on the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE), appreciated as much as 24.7 percent from the start of 2022 to April 11, 2022, but then declined to almost flattish territory in late June and was again up by 12.1 percent year to date on September 5, 2022. .While that may not seem like a lot, it still puts the QSE Index as a relative outperformer among most major regional and global markets in the first eight months of this year, as per the latest data available. .“Given that the country is preparing for the World Cup for more than a decade, to focus on a short period of stock performance won’t be a fair reflection,” said Akber Khan, senior director of asset management at Doha-based Al Rayan Investment. .“If we look at the performance of Qatar’s stock market in the last five years, when preparations related to the World Cup accelerated in terms of the pace of work, Qatar’s stock market is up more than 50 percent,” Khan added. .During that period, the broad index of emerging market equity is down more than 20 percent, while the global equity indices are up about 15 to 18 percent, he pointed out. . .Since 2010, when Qatar won the rights to host the World Cup, the state has spent more than $300bn to upgrade its infrastructure, including the Doha Metro, thousands of kilometres of local roads and highways, a new port, a new airport, and even a new city, as well as boosting its oil and gas facilities. .“This is really pulling forward a lot of medium-term development projects the state had and in many cases, a lot of projects that would have been completed over a decade are already finished to show off a developed Qatar during the World Cup,” Khan added. .The World Cup gains on the QSE are expected to carry into the next year as well, primarily from construction, real estate, tourism and retail spending that trickles down to the exchange-listed companies and the broader economy as a whole. .“Specifically, Qatar’s objective is to use the event as a springboard to showcase its offerings, and hopefully boost international tourist arrivals from 2.1 million in 2019 to 6 million per year by 2030,” said Saugata Sarkar, head of research at QNB Financial Services. .Qatari equities are already in an investment sweet spot benefitting from unique tailwinds. Adding to high oil and gas prices, significant net foreign investment flows given Qatar’s status as a safe haven, and hosting the upcoming World Cup, the country has also undertaken an expansion of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities that will nearly double its gas output, catapulting it to the pole position as a major producer. .“We believe that these drivers could be largely priced into the market, but should provide the QSE Index with high-quality catalysts that help grow or stabilise the market despite the overall prevalent global risk-off backdrop,” Sarkar said. .“While we cannot rule out near-term volatility in the market, we continue to remain bullish longer-term on Qatari stocks given their defensive characteristics backed by their strong fundamentals. Net-net, we expect strong results from Qatari companies in 2022 largely driven by the FIFA World Cup,” he added. .The spoiler will be the war in Ukraine, he cautioned, which is keeping Qatari and global indices volatile. .  . .However, what works in Qatar’s favour as the world deals with the possibility of a recession is the fact that the country’s economic growth is tied to its gas production. .With new demand coming from Europe because of the Ukraine war and the fact that Qatar is the “lowest-cost” producer, “it is better prepared to absorb the negative impact a recession may have on energy prices,” said Mohsin Mujtaba, director, product and development, QSE. That will also be attractive to foreign investors as they look to rebalance their portfolios in the face of a global slowdown, he added. .According to regional equity experts, the projects initiated by the government of Qatar to host FIFA 2022 will have a long-term effect on listed companies across various sectors. .BDSwiss MENA CEO Daniel Takieddine said in an email that, while the hundreds of thousands of visitors coming for the month-long football tournament will have an immediate effect, “more lasting consequences on the economy and financial markets in the country could be recorded. The widely followed event could draw attention from individuals and companies alike to Qatar as a tourism spot and as an investment destination boosting inflows of capital.” .Oliver Kent, managing director at Dubai-based ZK Sports & Entertainment, said he looks at the World Cup as “just the start of a series of large-scale events that will draw visitors in large numbers, boosting the tourism sector over the longer term”, citing a Formula 1 race and the 2023 Asia Cup that the country will host next year. .Qatar 2022 CEO Nasser al-Khater expects that the FIFA World Cup will contribute $17bn to Qatar’s economy during the event, down from an initial estimate of $20bn. .While the primary beneficiaries will be the hospitality industry, including hotels, malls, shops and retail, Al Rayan Investment’s Khan said several listed small and mid-cap companies that won government contracts as suppliers to larger firms over the last several years will equally benefit. These include firms that provide paving stones and building materials, as well as apartment rental and security services, among others, he said.",523
524,Published On 20 Nov 2022,Ten players missing out on World Cup 2022 due to injury,"Here are some players who helped their teams qualify, are good enough to be in squad but then miss the flight due to an unfortunate injury.",".Playing in the World Cup is probably the dream of every footballer and the pinnacle of their career. .Some, like Pele, not only participated in the tournament more than once, but also went on to lift the trophy on multiple occasions. .But some top footballers end their careers without making it to the tournament. .Some of those help their team qualify and are good enough to be in the squad, but then miss the flight due to an unfortunate injury. .Here are 10 top footballers who are missing out on World Cup 2022 due to injury, with a special mention for France’s Karim Benzema who got ruled out a day before the start of the World Cup. .Perhaps the biggest name on the list, Paul Pogba – a World Cup and Euro winner with France, international star, and most importantly, vital member of the French team – will not be available this time as they look to defend their title in Qatar. .Pogba underwent surgery in September for a knee injury and will not recover in time as France open their title defence on November 22 against Australia. .Senegal’s star forward Sadio Mane was on the roster for Qatar but had to be withdrawn two days before the tournament’s opening match on Sunday. Mane suffered a leg injury while playing for his club Bayern Munich earlier this month. .The news did not go down well with the Senegalese fans as their hopes for the success of the Teranga Tigers lay on Mane’s shoulders. Senegal play their first match against the Netherlands on November 21. .Marcus Reus has had his share of bad luck when it comes to the World Cup. .The 33-year-old missed the 2014 edition due to injury, and his team went on to lift the trophy. Reus was set to make a comeback after injury and be part of Hansi Flick’s German side for the 2022 World Cup, only for him to aggravate the injury on his ankle and be ruled out yet again. .One of Portugal’s main men in attack, Diogo Jota would have been among the first names in his team’s starting XI during their World Cup campaign. But Jota suffered a calf injury representing his club Liverpool during a league match in October. .While Jota did not require surgery, the rehabilitation period from his injury will be long enough to keep him out of the World Cup. Pundits have put down Portugal among the favourites for the tournament and missing Jota may have a big effect on their chances. .Most of Amine Harit’s Moroccan teammates had already landed in Qatar when he sustained an injury that would put him out of the World Cup. The Marseille forward suffered a knee injury in his last club game before heading out for Doha. .The 25-year-old was carried off on a stretcher. The images broke Moroccan hearts. Local media outlets were flooded with messages of support from his teammates, and Harit will reportedly travel to Qatar to support his team during the tournament. .In one of those incidents when a player gets injured without even being involved in a match, the Brazilian midfielder injured his left thigh while training at his club Liverpool. The injury happened in October and will keep Melo out of the World Cup. .The 22-year-old showed his despair in an Instagram post: “It comes just at a time when, after huge effort and lots of hard work, I was ready to establish myself in my new team and determined to fight for my dream of playing at the World Cup.” .With age on his side, Melo may still get another chance to play in a World Cup. .France coach Didier Deschamps will have an N’Golo Kante-sized hole in his midfield when the team takes to the pitch against Australia in their tournament opener. The diverse midfield maestro suffered a serious hamstring injury last month, which has ruled him out until January. .The 33-year-old was a key cog in the French midfield when the Les Blues won their second World Cup four years ago. He was France’s man of the match in some of the games during their run to the tournament and has since been a regular name on the team sheet. .It remains to be seen if he will be fit and in form when the next World Cup comes around, but age does not seem to be on his side. .In addition to a long list of forwards and midfielders who have knocked themselves out of the World Cup, Japan’s Yuta Nakayama is one of those working in defence. .The 25-year-old suffered an Achilles injury while playing for his English club Huddersfield Town earlier this month. Nakayama has earned 17 caps with Japan and was in coach Hajime Moriyasu’s Qatar-bound squad until he got injured earlier this month. .Japan open their campaign against Germany on November 23. .Ghana’s team can expect to find plenty of support in Qatar when they open their World Cup campaign against Portugal on November 24. However, they will be missing the defensive capabilities of their goalkeeper Jojo Wallacott who has been ruled out of the tournament with a finger injury. .Wallacott plays club football at Charlton Athletic in England, and was left out of the 26-man squad less than a week before the start of the World Cup. .Reports in Ghanian media suggested Wallacott may still travel with the squad but will not take part in the tournament. . .  .Argentina are among the favourites to lift the trophy in Qatar, and not just because of a certain Lionel Messi. .The 2014 finalists have a solid list of players in their squad, and a Copa America title to their name. One of the most important figures of that title win, however, will be missing in action in Qatar. .Giovani Lo Celso, a vital part of the Argentinian midfield, was ruled out after a muscle tear last month. Lo Celso is so critical to coach Lionel Scaloni that he has said there is no replacement for the 26-year-old midfielder. “Numerically there is a replacement, but football-wise there is not,” Scaloni told reporters earlier this month.",524
525,Published On 20 Nov 2022,Ronaldo takes field in Qatar for first World Cup training session,Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival in Doha marks his fifth — and possibly final — World Cup following the Portuguese captain’s public falling out with Manchester United last week.,".Cristiano Ronaldo has participated in his first Qatar World Cup training session following a bout with gastroenteritis, as Portugal gets ready to take on Ghana in their debut match. .On Saturday, a day after landing in the host nation, Ronaldo resumed training with Portugal, marking the team’s first collective training session since arriving in Doha. .Portugal, drawn into Group H, plays Ghana on Thursday; they play Uruguay on November 28 and South Korea on December 2. .Approaching his fifth World Cup appearance, this could be Ronaldo’s last as the Portuguese captain has repeatedly hinted at retirement in recent years. .The Manchester United forward’s arrival in Qatar comes as his club career also appears to be in doubt. Last week, during a scathing interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo said he felt “betrayed” by the Old Trafford Club and added he had no respect for head coach Erik ten Hag. .“The owners of the club, [the] Glazers… they don’t care — I mean professionally, sportingly,” Ronaldo said in the interview. “They don’t care. I never spoke to them, never.” .Manchester United has not directly responded to the remarks but is rumoured to be exploring legal options, which would allow the club to dispense of the star forward prematurely. .“Manchester United has this morning initiated appropriate steps in response to Cristiano Ronaldo’s recent media interview,” the club said in a statement on Friday. .They added: “We will not be making further comment until this process reaches its conclusion.” .Portugal’s midfielder Bernardo Silva, however, brushed off speculation that the ordeal had become a distraction for the national team. .“The news that comes from England has nothing to do with the national team so I won’t say anything,” Silva said in a recent interview. .Portugal’s best World Cup finish came in 1966 when the national squad claimed third place in England. They have not made it to the quarter-finals since the 2006 World Cup in Germany when they captured fourth place.",525

We will do everything to meet the huge challenge that awaits us,” Deschamps said in a statement. .The Real Madrid striker has been struggling with a thigh problem since October. However, he had a stellar season with Real Madrid last season, scoring 44 goals in 46 games in all competitions as he helped guide them to a LaLiga and Champions League double. .“I’ve never given up in my life but tonight I have to think of the team, as I have always done,” Benzema wrote in an Instagram post. .“So reason tells me to give my place to someone who can help our squad have a great World Cup. Thanks for all your messages of support.” .L’Equipe reported that Benzema, this year’s winner of the Ballon d’Or, “felt a sharp muscle pain” in his left thigh in training. .Saturday was the first time Benzema had taken part in full training since Deschamps’s squad met up at their French headquarters of Clairefontaine last Monday. .Under FIFA rules, Deschamps can call up a replacement for an injured player until Monday, on the eve of their first game against Australia. .Doubts over Benzema’s fitness were a significant headache for Deschamps, already deprived of the services of midfielders Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante, number two goalkeeper Mike Maignan, defender Presnel Kimpembe and forward Christopher Nkunku. .Benzema had not played an entire match since October 19. .He and Raphael Varane trained apart from the rest of the squad on Thursday during a session open to the media at the home stadium of Qatari champions Al Sadd. .Manchester United centre-back Varane has not played a game since coming off in tears against Chelsea on October 22.",527
528,Published On 19 Nov 2022,European World Cup teams set to defy FIFA with rainbow armbands,Danish and German captains set to wear rainbow armbands despite last-minute FIFA proposal for alternative armbands.,".European football stars say they will press on with plans to wear rainbow-coloured armbands despite a last-minute FIFA proposal for captains of World Cup teams to wear alternative armbands. .Captains, including Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, say they want to wear rainbow designs as part of the Netherlands-led “OneLove” anti-discrimination campaign, as they prepare to compete in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal. .Qatar has faced criticism from some countries playing in the 32-team tournament over its rights record on migrant workers, women and the LGBTQ community. .Tournament organisers say that everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome in Qatar. .FIFA, which had not directly addressed the Europeans’ request several weeks ago for permission to wear the heart-shaped logo, unveiled its alternate proposal on Saturday — armbands promoting social messages such as “Football unites the world” and “Share the meal” in a United Nations-backed campaign. .Asked by reporters if he would override the FIFA plan, Neuer replied: “Yes.” .“It’s good that we have the power with other nations in Western Europe,” Neuer said. .England, Wales and Denmark have also joined the campaign. .World Cup rules state that kit such as captains’ armbands must be authorised by FIFA, but Neuer said he would wear the “OneLove” design, even if it meant being issued a fine by football’s world governing body. .The FIFA choice of slogans for group games include “SaveThePlanet”, “ProtectChildren”, and “ShareTheMeal”. “NoDiscrimination”, which aligns with the European teams’ protest, is scheduled to be worn in the quarter-finals. .“These campaigns have taken into account feedback received from our member associations who, like FIFA, are committed to using the power of football to effect positive change around the world,” said a FIFA spokesperson. .Denmark’s Christian Eriksen said his country’s captain Simon Kjaer would be wearing the rainbow armband, too, regardless of potential disciplinary action. .“We as a country are wearing it; our captain will be wearing the OneLove armband,” Eriksen said. .“What the consequences will be I don’t know, but we’ll see.” .Denmark sporting director Peter Moller described the timing of FIFA’s announcement as “a little bit strange”. .“We think the [armband] that we are playing with,” Moller said, “is an even stronger statement.” .Denmark had asked football governing body FIFA to wear shirts carrying the slogan “Human rights for all” during training sessions, but the request was denied because it is a “political message”, according to the federation. .England’s Three Lions are also believed to be ready to support the “OneLove” campaign and are understood to be seeking clarity on whether the rainbow armband and the FIFA ones can be worn together. .The United States team have also shown their support with a rainbow-coloured logo inside their training facility.",528
529,Published On 19 Nov 2022,The 10 stars for whom Qatar will likely be their last World Cup,"From Messi to Suarez to Benzema, these are the prominent players likely to make final bow in top competition.",".The football World Cup kicking off in Qatar on Sunday will likely be the final act on the global stage for numerous stars of the game. .Here’s a list of 10 players who are widely expected to be making their final bow in the sport’s most prestigious tournament. .Qatar 2022 will be Messi’s fifth World Cup. The 35-year-old forward of French side Paris St Germain will be hoping to build on Argentina’s Copa America triumph last year and win the one trophy that has eluded him so far in his storied career. .The narrative around the Portuguese superstar should have been dominated by his quest to win Portugal its first-ever World Cup. But instead, Cristiano Ronaldo enters the campaign with the smoke of an explosive interview in which he lambasted his club Manchester United hanging over him. .While Modric’s age belies his performances, the 37-year-old cannot defy time forever. The winner of the Golden Ball for the 2018 World Cup in Russia – an award given to the tournament’s best player – will be hoping to take his country one step further than they did last time around, when Croatia lost to France in the final. .The World Cup is a significant chapter in the legend of Luis Suarez – the goal-line save against Ghana in 2010, the brace against England in 2014 and the infamous Leonardo Bonucci bite are all part of World Cup folklore. At 35, Uruguay will be hoping for one more flourish as they prepare to face South Korea, Portugal and – as fate would have it – Ghana. .The World Cup in Russia was supposed to have been Thiago Silva’s last. But, the Chelsea centre back has shown no signs of slowing down and even at the age of 38, remains one of the best defenders in the world. .The 36-year-old is set to become the first Japanese player to appear in four World Cups. .“I’m 36 but physically fit, I’ve played against big players in Europe and at the World Cup. I don’t forget the experiences that are etched into my cells. I can definitely fight whatever kind of players or teams that come my way,” he said in an interview with The Japan Times. .“You never know, but I assume it will be my last World Cup,” German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said in an interview earlier this month. .While the 2014 World Cup winner will be 40 by the time the next World Cup rolls along, he did mention that Qatar 2022 “doesn’t necessarily” have to be his last appearance on the global stage. .For all that he has achieved with Real Madrid, Ballon d’Or winner Karim Benzema is yet to have a defining tournament for France. He was not included in Les Blues’ 2018 winning squad and given his age and the level of talent in France’s ranks, this will likely be his last chance to make an impact at the World Cup. .UPDATE: Benzema was ruled out of the World Cup on Saturday. .At 38, veteran goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi is one of the oldest players taking part in the World Cup this year. Mathlouthi was the captain for Tunisia in the last World Cup and returns to the squad after a three-year absence in a list of four goalkeepers for the tournament. .At 34, Sergio Busquets has shown some signs that age is catching up with him. But, he remains a key member of Luis Enrique’s Spanish squad. .“If we can control the type of match, and make it the one we want, meaning controlling possession and dominating the opponent around their defensive area of the pitch, then ‘Busi’ is still the No. 1 in his position,” Enrique said in an interview to ESPN. .",529
530,Published On 19 Nov 2022,FIFA president slams Western ‘hypocrisy’ over Qatar criticism,"In fiery news conference, Gianni Infantino said Western countries were not in a position to give ‘moral lessons’.",".Doha, Qatar – FIFA President Gianni Infantino accused Western countries of “hypocrisy” saying they were not in a position to give “moral lessons” to other nations, hours before the World Cup kicks off in Qatar. .In a fiery news conference in the Qatari capital on the eve of the tournament, the Swiss Italian said Europe should address its past crimes before pointing fingers at Qatar. .“I’m European. For what we Europeans have been doing around the world in the last 3,000 years, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people,” Infantino told hundreds of reporters on Saturday. .Qatar, which was awarded the right to host the global football tournament in 2010, has received criticism for its treatment of migrant workers and human rights record. . .Infantino, son of migrant workers from Italy, said the Middle Eastern country has “made progress” in improving the rights of migrant workers. .“I came here six years ago and addressed the matter of migrant workers straight on, in my very first meeting,” Infantino said, pausing and looking straight at the gathered journalists. .“How many of these European or Western business companies, who earned millions and millions from Qatar and other countries in the region – billions every year – how many of them addressed the rights of migrant workers with the authorities? .“I have the answer for you. None of them,” the FIFA chief said, adding “the one-sided moral lesson is just hypocrisy.” .Homosexuality is illegal in the country, but Qatar has said all fans are welcome to attend the showpiece event. .“I have been speaking about this topic with the highest leadership of the country. Several times, not just once. They have confirmed, I can confirm, that everyone is welcome,” the FIFA president said. .In remarks to reporters at the end of the news conference, FIFA media chief Bryan Swanson, who is gay, insisted everyone is welcome in Qatar. .“I’ve seen a lot of criticism of Gianni Infantino since I’ve joined FIFA, in particular from the LGBTQ community,” Swanson said. .“I’m sitting here in a privileged position on a global stage as a gay man here in Qatar. We have received assurances that everybody is welcome and I believe that everybody will be welcome in this World Cup,” he added. .Critics also questioned Qatar, the first country in the Arab world to host the competition, for banning the sale of alcohol inside stadiums during the tournament. .“Every decision that is taken in this World Cup, it is a joint decision between Qatar and FIFA. Every decision is discussed, debated and taken jointly. There will be, I don’t know how many, fan zones – eight, 10, big fan zones, over 200 places where you can buy alcohol,” Infantino said. .He also pointed out this was not unusual as drinking inside football stadiums is banned in major European nations such as France, Spain, Portugal and Scotland. .Despite some critics calling for companies to boycott the World Cup, Infantino hailed the “commercial success” of this year’s tournament. .“We sold the media rights for around $200m more than the last World Cup,” he said. “We sold the sponsorship rights for also around $200m more than the last World Cup. .“And as far as ticketing and hospitality rights are concerned, we are at almost 200 to 300 million more than the last World Cup.” .Qatar will kick off the 32-team tournament on Sunday against Ecuador. Infantino said the Gulf country has done impressive work in preparing for the matches. .“Doha is ready. Qatar is ready. It will be the best World Cup ever, of course,” he said.",530
531,Published On 19 Nov 2022,What the World Cup means to foreign residents of Qatar,"From feeling proud to complaining about continuous construction works, foreign residents in the World Cup host country describe what they think about the event.",".Doha, Qatar – On the eve of kickoff, excitement is running high for Qatar’s citizens and foreign residents. It has been a long wait since the Gulf state was awarded the football World Cup in 2010. .This period has been marked by a frenzy of construction work that transformed the capital, Doha, and its surrounding areas – and has come with its own set of challenges and opportunities. .With the vast majority of Qatar’s three million population being from abroad, the gas-rich country has been able to capitalise on the influx of foreign talent, skills and cultures brought by those who were driven to it by the promise of jobs. .So, how do some of Qatar’s foreign residents feel about the FIFA World Cup being held in Qatar? Al Jazeera spoke to some of them to find out. .Paul El Boustani is of Polish-Lebanese descent but was born in Qatar and calls it home. .The 31-year-old finance executive says he is proud that Qatar will host the World Cup but admits there were many frustrating moments as the country readied for action. .“One day you are driving down a road to work and the next day the road is closed without notice for infrastructure work. That got frustrating on a regular basis,” he said. “Also parking was and still is a big issue due to reduced spots as a result of construction.” .Syrian-American Bayan Kayyali has been in Qatar since 2019. .The 18-year-old university student says it is significant that an Arab and Islamic country is hosting the tournament because it will allow people in the West to know the region better, as not many of them “are exposed to this culture”. .“There’s a lot of hypocrisy in the Western press about the World Cup coverage. A lot of it is rooted in xenophobia and racism,” she argues, referring to negative reports about Qatar in the lead-up to the event. .“Hosting the games comes with its own challenges, be it Qatar, Russia, Brazil,” she says, citing the countries where the World Cup was held previously. “It’s always going to come with its own complications.” .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been in the spotlight since it won the right to host the tournament, leading to calls for teams to boycott it altogether. Qatari and FIFA officials have hit back at the criticism and denounced what they described as a “double standard”. .A recent cartoon by a French publication depicting Qatari footballers as “terrorists” sparked outrage on social media, with users calling out its “blatant Islamophobia” and “racism”. .“France also has many laws that discriminate against people on the basis of religion,” Kayyali says. “Also, Denmark’s players have decided to wear faded-out jerseys to protest human rights issues in Qatar. But Denmark has a policy of sending back Syrian refugees to Syria,” she adds. .Justin, a 30-year-old personal trainer from the southwestern Kenyan town of Kisii, has been living in Qatar since March 2012. .“When I came to Qatar, I went to school to become a personal trainer. It wasn’t easy as I had to pay from the small salary I was receiving as a recreation attendant. Now, I make a living from helping people become healthy,” he says. .Having been in Qatar through the biggest part of the preparations leading to the World Cup, Justin does not shy away from complaining about the traffic that was caused by the continuous construction. .“What would normally be a 10- to 15-minute ride, transformed overnight to 30-45 minutes. It was difficult to meet clients or come to work; a lot of time was being lost just stuck in the car.” .But Qatar winning the right to host the event has had many positive, Justin notes. .“Since the country really started working on getting ready, there has been a lot of awareness on the importance of sports. More and more people come to train in the gym, lose the excess weight and become healthier. It has become a trend, and I hope this will continue after all the World Cup hype will fade,” he says. .Ismael Cadus is a 37-year-old Palestinian teacher who was born in Brazil but now resides in Doha. .“Football fans will now get acquainted with Arab culture. This is not a moment of pride just for Qatar, but across the Arab world,” he says. .“For many travellers from distant places like Brazil, they don’t just get to experience the thrill of the World Cup. They can travel to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Christ, the home of the pharaohs, Egypt – all in one trip. It’s a great Middle East travel adventure,” he adds. .Aurelie, a 31-year-old travel planner from France, says World Cup excitement is palpable across Doha but in the lead-up to it, residents have faced a number of challenges. .“Life has become more expensive, especially rent,” she says. “With the World Cup approaching, most landlords have raised rents on properties. It’s painful, who likes paying more rent? Although everything is expensive in Qatar, except for gas.” .Aurelie adds that frequent road closures and traffic diversions during the massive infrastructure push were annoying for residents, but feels it is a “treat” to be residing in Qatar while it hosts the event. .“It’s a huge challenge for Qatar because it’s the first time the World Cup will take place in a Gulf country and in the Arab world,” she adds. .“But it’s the first time in the history of World Cup that all the stadiums are so near. You won’t need to be on a flight to follow a team, just hop on a metro train. Fans like me who are supporters of several teams won’t have to miss out on matches because of travel issues, it’s all been made super easy. .“Habibi, come to Qatar and find out.”",531
532,Published On 19 Nov 2022,"Beer, sport, men: Inside the ‘Holy Trinity’ of alcohol marketing","Men have traditionally been the common link between sport and booze, but times are changing.",".There is a great cultural irony in sports fans standing around commenting on the prowess of professional athletes while holding a beer in their hand, academic Lawrence Wenner wrote 30 years ago. .From podium celebrations with champagne to locker-room shenanigans and sports bars, alcohol, sports – and a certain interpretation of masculinity – have long been commodified together as a tripartite, co-dependent culture. .On Saturday, FIFA announced alcohol will no longer be available at stadiums hosting Qatar World Cup 2022 matches. It will still be available in Qatar during the tournament but not be as omnipresent as at previous tournaments. .But where are the roots of this nexus? How did the world of sport start to revolve around alcohol? .It all goes back at least as far as the Romans, says Professor Steve Jackson, of Otago University in New Zealand. .“They would provide bread and circuses – which included wine and various alcohol – to appease the citizens and to dispel social unrest,” Jackson told Al Jazeera. .In more recent times, United States advertisers soon realised the power of identifying their product with a sports team in the early days of popular radio. Regional brewers would sponsor local baseball teams in the hope of building crossover loyalties, where fans’ loyalties and behaviour would become associated with loyalty to the local beer that “brought you the game”. .Sports, beer and masculinity form a systematically naturalised “Holy Trinity”, says Jackson, as they interact with the marketplace and a broader drawing of gender in contemporary culture. . .While many elite-level sports have traditionally found men as their primary participants and supporters, it is a long-running trope that what is often now dubbed “toxic masculinity” has made it difficult for men to openly discuss personal matters, emotions or mental health. .“[Beer] facilitates interaction among men, and also increasingly women,” Paul Widdop, an academic on the geopolitical economy of sport at the University of Manchester, told Al Jazeera. .“It is part of the culture of sport, culture that is created by generations of fans interacting with a symbolic attachment – not only to beer brands – but also to pubs. It’s why most Victorian football grounds are located next to pubs.” .In that sense, alcohol works as a social lubricant. .The marketing of sport and alcohol is the crucible in which this relationship is forged. The 30 leading alcoholic beverage brands are spending more than $760m each year across more than 280 active deals to sponsor the biggest competitions, clubs and athletes in the sports industry, according to sports market intelligence company Sportcal. .Heineken, which spends upwards of $118.3m annually on sport sponsorships, currently has 25 active deals, including a $21.4m annual deal with Formula One and a $10m deal with Major League Soccer. Bud Light’s $230m annual NFL sponsorship, of its total sports spending of $249.7m, makes it the industry’s biggest spender on sports advertising. .A study of the 2020 rugby Six Nations Championship revealed an alcohol reference every 12 seconds on average during each game. The vast majority of these related to the primary sponsor of the event – Guinness. In Ethiopia, where alcohol advertising is banned, a study of televised English Premier League football matches showed some form of alcohol advertising on screen for an average of 10.8 minutes – of a 90-minute game. .With football the most popular sport in the world, it is also the most targeted by alcohol brands. Some 49 percent of all active alcohol sponsorship deals centre on football. Of those, 59 percent target European consumers. The next biggest market is North America, with 20 percent. .What does that mean in real terms? .As England prepared to face Denmark in the Euro 2020 semi-final, publicans were preparing to pour an expected 10 million pints on match day, the British Beer and Pub Association estimated. The Economist reported that, during the match itself, some 50,000 drinks would be purchased every minute. .Excessive consumption is linked to violent behaviour. Alcohol is also an established link between sports results and abuse. Domestic violence cases spike by 38 percent when England lose a football game, a 2014 Lancaster University study reported. .They spike by 26 percent when they win or draw. .But it is not just the big televised leagues where alcohol is ubiquitous. Grassroots sports clubs are often at the heart of communities around the world, running youth and senior teams, while the clubhouse provides a largely self-regulating social space, usually with a bar providing a necessary income stream to keep the club afloat. .“Here the culture of sports and its pairing with the culture of beer and drinking is naturalised,” Wenner says. “[It] becomes a sign or code of acceptable masculinity, signing that you are a ‘real man’ rather than one who ‘opts out’ and thus may have his masculinity called into question. So it’s an embedded exercise in socialisation of what it means to be a male – a male, of course, on the terms and conditions of ‘the good old days’ when ‘men were men’. I call this kind of masculinity ideal ‘vestigial hypermasculinity’.” .While the culture of sport and alcohol has undoubtedly had an effect on the development of masculine identity in the 20th and 21st centuries, its advocates argue that many opportunities for people to play sport would not exist were it not for the income from alcohol sponsorship and sales. .Estimates have suggested that 300 million British pounds ($350m) come from alcohol sponsorship to sport in the UK alone, which accounts for about 12 percent of the country’s total sports sponsorship. Of that, approximately 50 million pounds ($60m) goes directly to grassroots sports. This creates investment in facilities, stadia, player development, regional structures and tournaments, notes the Portman Group, an alcohol industry trade group which promotes responsible drinking and aims to protect children from alcohol marketing. . .“Our code prevents sponsorship marketing activities from suggesting it is acceptable to consume alcohol before, or while, playing sport,” CEO Matt Lambert told Al Jazeera. “About a tenth of UK sports sponsorship comes from alcohol – and that supports a healthy, balanced lifestyle by helping grassroots sport and cultural events. Sponsorship makes activities more accessible, providing funding for equipment and facilities to develop amateur and professional sports through partnerships.” .Even if it were desired, is it now too late to decouple sports and booze? .There may be health and social reasons to do so – but the most powerful catalyst for change will always be the desire of the markets. If there is money to be made, culture can change. And as sports franchises look to expand their global reach in new geographical markets, so are their sponsors. Bahrain’s Formula One celebrations, for example, feature sparkling grape juice. .To the innocent eyes, it looks the same as a champagne celebration anywhere else in the world. .The alcohol industry’s solution to reaching consumers in Islamic or Muslim-majority countries is not about delinking drinking culture and sports, but substituting a locally acceptable variation, says Jackson: “Many countries in the Middle East in particular are now on this massive campaign – linked to sportswashing – in which they’re trying to find a balance. So we shouldn’t be surprised that they’re going to introduce no-alcohol drinks. .“It might open up a space where male consumers in these countries can then legally, ethically, engage in this sports-drinking culture – and then they’re becoming part of exactly what Budweiser and all the big companies want. It’s beer-washing.” .Similarly, with the growing popularity of women’s sports, advertisers appear understandably reluctant to break a profitable association and instead adapt, featuring more women in alcohol advertising – as consumers rather than commodities, which had been a hallmark of historic alcohol advertising. .“The FIFA Women’s World Cup is here in New Zealand and Australia next year, and the alcohol industries are looking to cash in on that,” says Jackson. “And often it’s not just beer [targeted at women], it’s hard liquor.” .Professor Catherine Palmer, of Northumbria University, lays out an emerging research agenda for defining the relationship between women, sport and alcohol as a feminist issue, noting that the framing of women’s relationships with alcohol is invariably portrayed as problematic, in comparison to men’s consumption. .Sport-related drinking for women is as pleasurable and problematic as it is for men, she wrote in 2019. .The centuries-old joint culture of alcohol and sports appears unlikely to come to an end any time soon. With no alternative sports funding identified, alcohol sponsorship will continue to play a huge role in grassroots and elite clubs and competitions. But culture does change and expand, especially if there’s a profit motive. .And as the worlds of alcohol and sports both continue to adapt in a bid to reach non-traditional markets, we may yet see a profit motive in inclusivity and a decoupling of the more “toxic” and violent elements of the culture. .And that’s something worth raising a glass to.",532

Coach: Luis Fernando Suarez
Key player: Bryan Ruiz .Costa Rica became the 32nd and final team to qualify for World Cup 2022 when they beat New Zealand 1-0 in the intercontinental playoff in June. .Although “Los Ticos” left it till the last qualification match to book their place at Qatar 2022, they have had an impressive run at the tournament since making their debut in 1990. .The Central American team’s best finish came in 2014, when they reached the quarter-finals where they were knocked out in penalties by the Netherlands. It brought an end to a glorious run that began with a 3-1 win over Uruguay, followed by a shock 1-0 win over former champions Italy and a goalless draw against England. .They topped their group and went on to beat Greece in the round of 16 on penalties. .That performance turned the luck of the squad as some of the players were snapped up by some of the biggest clubs in world football. .In their debut at the World Cup 1990, Costa Rica won two out of three group matches, including a 2-1 win over Sweden, to progress. They failed to go past the group stage in 2002 and 2006, and missed out on qualifying for the 2010 edition. .The last World Cup saw them earn a solitary point through a draw against Switzerland. .In the run-up to this World Cup, Costa Rica won just one of their first seven qualifiers but turned their fortunes around by winning six of their last seven and earning a playoff spot. Celso Borges, Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell and Keylor Navas brought all their experience into play as the team managed to squeeze out favourable results when it mattered. .Costa Rica are managed by Luis Fernando Suarez, who is no stranger to the World Cup. Suarez has managed Ecuador and Honduras at the tournament, and wants to go one better in Qatar. .“My third World Cup is an obsession for me,” he said in the lead-up to the playoff tie. .“The main thing is to be able to choose people who are not just players but who are suited to being in the national team, who are good for it.” .The 62-year-old is likely to have a number of veterans in the squad when he puts out his playing 11 on November 23. .Joel Campbell, a forward with 118 games and 25 goals to his name, is likely to lead the attack along with 22-year-old rising star Anthony Contreras. Captain Bryan Ruiz and Los Ticos’ most capped player Celso Borges will run the show from the midfield. .Costa Rica boast a strong defence with the likes of Juan Pablo Vargas and Oscar Duarte. Keylor Navas was crucial in ensuring his side’s qualification for the tournament when he kept New Zealand at bay during the playoff. .Despite a history of causing upsets, Los Ticos may find it difficult to make it past the group stage. They are placed in Group E, the so-called group of death, along with former champions Spain and Germany and Asian powerhouse Japan. .Despite a decent run of results in their last few competitive games, the Central Americans will have the odds stacked heavily against them. .A shock win or a couple of draws against their much-fancied opponents would make for an impressive run in Qatar.",534
535,Published On 19 Nov 2022,"Shoomilah, Shoomilah: Rise of Qatar’s unofficial football anthem",The song will resound across Qatar as the national team makes its World Cup debut on November 20.,".Doha, Qatar – A little-known word became a rousing anthem of national pride, first for a country under a regional diplomatic boycott in 2017 and again when Qatar, against all odds, won the Asian Cup football tournament in 2019. .Shoomilah, Shoomilah did not originate on the pitch but that did not stop it from becoming the Qatari national football team’s unofficial anthem. .Using the language of courtship as metaphor to describe a relationship of support and admiration between a nation and its leader, the song captured hearts and minds in Qatar right away. It played everywhere, even at weddings. .Shoomilah (aspire to him) is an old Arabic phrase, used in more recent tradition to advise young women of marriage age to choose the finest warrior as their suitor. .The song first came to prominence on December 18, 2017, when Qatar celebrated its first national day after its neighbours Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain announced a blockade on it. .On June 5 that year, the four countries severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar and imposed a sea, land and air blockade, claiming Qatar supported “terrorism” and was too close to their rival Iran. Qatar denied the allegations. . .The blockade lasted more than three years, during which expressions of defiance proliferated in Qatar, motivating poet and lyricist Ayedh bin Ghidah who said he wanted to “give a metaphorical reply to the attacks on Qatar – which tried to question Qataris’ loyalty to their leadership – during the blockade”. .His lyrics urged a metaphorical woman “with beautiful eyelashes” to “aspire to the swordsman, a true sheikh whose stands please those around him”, who “has been special since a young age” and whose “actions show his persistence”. .The meaning of shoomilah was a mystery to many. .“I’d heard of it but wasn’t sure about its precise meaning … it’s not often used,” said Sabah Al Kuwari, then-general manager of Al Rayyan TV, which oversaw its production. .“It’s mostly elders who use it,” Al Kuwari told Al Jazeera Arabic in 2019 for the documentary, Songs of the Gulf, adding that he liked the song from the start but that when he played it for someone, “they said ‘I don’t think you should do the production or promote it because it won’t be a hit’.” .Bin Ghidah, who started writing poetry in primary school, said that when he shared the piece “some people said the lyrics were too stiff”, but he felt they “would be mysterious and intriguing”. .“People still ask me to this day about the meaning of Shoomilah,” bin Ghidah told Al Jazeera. .“It means ‘aspire to him’. It is an expressive image of the Qatari nation that rose to the occasion and showed loyalty and support to its leader amid the blockade.” .In the imagination of the lyricist, the emir is “steadfast … shows unwavering will”. .“We are the supporters of his rule and we are his army. We bend for him. Tell him that your people pledged loyalty to you. Tell him,” it goes. .In Songs of the Gulf, bin Ghidah clarified that while the word might be uncommon today, it is “part of our tradition, our environment, and language”. .It originates from Nabati Arabic poetry, he said, referring to a Bedouin vernacular style deviating from classical Arabic. .When Qatar won its first Asian Cup in 2019, Shoomilah, Shoomilah crossed borders, growing in popularity, especially in Kuwait and Oman, neutral countries in the Gulf crisis. .Some fans said they liked Kuwaiti singer Ibrahim Dashti’s energetic version with its artful percussions, while others are partial to Yemeni singer Maria Qahtan’s rendition. .Instagram influencer Zahra Al Ansari told Al Jazeera the song evoked a “proud feeling [of] being a Qatari”. .Human resources professional Ghaliya Al Baker likened the anthem to a “logo” like Tamim Al Majd, but set to music. .She was referring to the famous silhouette of emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, which became a familiar sight as Qataris and residents displayed it on cars, shop windows, walls and more in a show of support and national pride during the boycott. .“It’s a good song to represent Qatar and its football team worldwide,” said Al Baker. .So, how did Shoomilah, Shoomilah end up associated with The Annabi, the Qatar national team? .In 2019, the story goes, Qatari national team players sang it in their locker room on January 29 after defeating the UAE in the Asian Cup semifinals in Abu Dhabi, urging the cup to choose the right suitors. .A video of the team singing was shared on Twitter a few days later, the day of the final game against Japan. .Shoomilah, Shoomilah had been played for the team by one of the players, according to Thomas Ross Griffin, author of Homeland: National Identity Performance in the Qatar National Team, a chapter in the book, Football in the Middle East. .The player told Griffin: “I made a deal with my teammates … before we start the game, we put Shoomilah on to give us motivation and also after the game to celebrate.” .Even players who could not understand all the lyrics, Griffin noted in the book, felt it gave the team “more and more power to represent Qatar”. .Qataris feel the song will stick around as their football anthem, encouraging their players to win. .Last year, about 60,000 people gathered at Al Bayt stadium and sang it after Qatar defeated Bahrain 1-0 in the inaugural match of the FIFA Arab Cup. .On November 20, Qatar will make its World Cup debut as hosts, taking on Ecuador at the same stadium. Shoomilah, Shoomilah will be heard from the galleries as a rallying cry as fans exhort the Maroons to give it their all.",535

It is almost a copy of their group in the World Cup 2018, where they were drawn with Denmark, Australia and Peru and topped the group with seven points. .Les Bleus’ first successful tournament came at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, where striker Just Fountaine would score 13 goals in six matches. .France would be soundly beaten 5-2 in the semi-final by eventual winners Brazil. .It was in the 1980s that France really announced itself on the international stage, finishing fourth and third in the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, respectively, and also winning the 1984 European Championships. .This France team included the likes of the midfield maestro Michel Platini and defender Marius Trésor and played a high-intensity football that produced some of the World Cup’s most dramatic matches, including the famous 3-3 semi-final against West Germany in 1982. .This golden generation would eventually give way to a France team that failed to qualify for the next two World Cups, and the nation would have to wait until 1998 when it hosted the World Cup for the second time in its history. .The 1998 team, which included Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Zinedine Zidane, would go on to win the tournament in emphatic style, beating Brazil 3-0 in the final and ushering in a new period of dominance that would see them pick up another European Championship in 2000. .After being knocked out in the group stages of the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, followed by a quarter-final exit to hosts and eventual winners Greece in the 2002 European Championships, France would once again reach the World Cup final in 2004. The tense match against Italy ended 1-1 and would see France lose 5-3 on penalties but will ultimately be best remembered for the infamous headbutt by Zidane on Marco Materazzi. .A fractious 2010 World Cup in South Africa saw Les Bleus exit at the group stages. .Internal turmoil sparked, in part due to a player’s boycott of training after Raymond Domenech dismissed Nicolas Anelka after the striker swore at him and openly criticised him. An improved performance in Brazil in 2014 would ultimately end in disappointment as France went out to Germany in the quarter-finals. .In 2018, following a second place at the 2016 European Championships, France would claim their second World Cup gold at the tournament in Russia, beating Croatia 4-2 in the final. .As one of the tournament’s favourites, France will expect to make at least the semi-finals, if not the final. .Les Bleus should make it through their group with relative ease. In the next phase, they will likely come up against Poland or Mexico, followed by a potential matchup with England, the Netherlands or Senegal if there are no major upsets. .In the semi-final, they could meet the likes of Brazil, Belgium or Germany. .Boasting a squad brimming with world-class talent, they must be considered a real contender to win the World Cup.

It’s not like alcohol is not sold in Qatar. People have to respect Muslim culture and get on with the tournament. I’ll feel much better about taking my family to the stadium now. We’re supporting Brazil,” he told Al Jazeera. .Federico Ferraz, a fan group organiser from Portugal, said the timing of the decision to ban alcohol at the stadiums was made too late. .“I think FIFA and Qatar left it very late to announce this decision … Fans are going to feel hard done by. They waited till the last minute, for everyone to buy tickets, book hotels and then they announced it. Were they afraid that fans wouldn’t have come here if they had banned alcohol earlier?” .Alcohol will still be served in hotels, luxury suites, private homes and at the FIFA Fan Festival site during the tournament. .In Doha’s Souq Waqif market, 35-year-old Pablo Zambrano of Ecuador shrugged off the news of the beer ban before his country’s opening night match against Qatar on Sunday. .He was staying with his mother, who lives in Qatar, and said the fridge already is stocked with beer, which foreigners can buy legally in selected depots. .“There’s things about the alcohol and the women with the dress codes,” Zambrano told the Associated Press news agency, referring to the country’s customs. “It’s different. But it’s going to be good.” .Zambrano was one of a growing number of fans sightseeing in the traditional market and along the Corniche, a seaside boulevard with views of Doha’s glittering skyline. .Just down the street, 24-year-old vegetable seller Ajmal Pial from Khulna, Bangladesh, took in the breeze with the city’s skyscrapers stretched out behind him across the waters of the Persian Gulf. .But instead of his nation’s green and red disc flag, Pial waved Brazil’s over his head as his friend took pictures of him. He and his friends support Argentina and Brazil, two of the tournament favourites. .For Pial and others, the World Cup represents a pinnacle of work in Qatar and likely a final hurrah before heading home as jobs potentially slow. .Labour conditions in Qatar, like many of the Gulf Arab states, have been criticised for exploiting the low-paid workers who built the former pearling port into a desert metropolis. .Qatar has overhauled its labour laws, but activists have asked for more to be done. There are no guarantees for freedom of speech in the country, but Pial said he felt genuinely happy at the chance to see the tournament. .His friend, 32-year-old Shobuz Sardar, also from Khulna, Bangladesh, said part of that excitement came from the fact that it is only the second time that an Asian country hosts the World Cup, 20 years after Japan and South Korea co-hosted the tournament. .He also said the tournament provided a rare opportunity to celebrate. .“You also know that there are too many people all here for work, for jobs,” Sardar said. “They don’t have any option for having fun.

Spain’s Barcelona and England’s Manchester City each have 16, according to research published this week by European football consultants LTT Sports. .Outside of Europe, Qatari champions Al Sadd has 15 players at the tournament, opening on Sunday. .The domestic leagues of the United States and Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, each have 35 players called up for World Cup duties with a variety of national squads. .Argentina is leaning heavily on the top five European leagues by calling up 23 international club footballers, including Messi from Paris Saint-Germain, as well as others from clubs in England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France. .Italian clubs alone are providing 70 players to World Cup squads – even though Italy’s national team did not qualify for the tournament. .The World Cup also means home comforts for the seven players selected for countries other than Qatar who play for clubs in the host nation.",539

The fire refers to the team’s nickname, the Red Devils. . .Translation: Check out the behind-the-scenes of the players’ rehearsal with the new Brazilian team uniform! .What else? Brazil’s Nike-designed home shirt is, of course, their iconic yellow. .“The 2022 Brazilian collection embodies vibrant audacity. This attitude, a balance of national pride and youth culture, is highlighted in the unique onca-pintada [jaguar] knit patterns of the home kit and print on the away kit sleeves,” Nike said. .“The kits also feature hidden symbols, like a discoverable Brazilian flag element on the home kit’s front placket, and a ‘Garra Brasileira’ [Brazilian grit] treatment on the inner back of the shirt, a reference to the nation’s grit and resilience,” it added. . .Cameroon once tried to wear a sleeveless shirt at the 2002 World Cup. It was an original idea, but FIFA banned it. This year’s kit (with sleeves) was designed by One All Sports, and the Cameroonian flag inspires the jersey. . .It is Canada’s first World Cup since 1986, but they have decided to not go with a new kit for the tournament. .“Canada Soccer is on a different kit development cycle,” Nike said.

Fixtures: Japan (November 23), Spain (November 27), Costa Rica (December 1) .The German football team has a rich history at the World Cup, beginning from the time when it played as two separate teams (East and West) up until the 2014 edition where it was crowned champion for the fourth time. .The Russia 2018 World Cup saw Die Mannschaft finally face the ignominy it had avoided on three previous occasions: a first-round exit as defending champions. .Germany has been among a handful of teams to participate in the tournament on a consistent basis. In fact, ever since the qualification process was introduced ahead of the 1934 World Cup, Germany has qualified for all tournaments. The first World Cup (1930) was by invitation only and West Germany, along with several other European teams, turned down the offer for several reasons. .The other one it missed was in 1950, when it was banned in the aftermath of World War II. .West Germany entered the 1954 World Cup as an unseeded side making its comeback in the tournament, and left as champion after defeating the greatest Hungarian side ever in “The Miracle of Bern” final. .The seeds of greatness were sown, and the so-called German resilience came to the fore for the first time. .Germany’s other three title wins came in less surprising circumstances in 1974 as hosts, in 1990 in a dull 1-0 win over Argentina, and in 2014 against the same foes. .Following a disastrous run at the 2018 World Cup, the German side continued to struggle and was set to drop out of the UEFA Nations League until the number of teams was increased by UEFA. .Despite the losses, its World Cup-winning coach Joachim Low continued at the helm. Germany’s poor performance and round of 16 exit at the Euro 2020 ended Low’s reign. His assistant, Hansi Flick, then took over. .Flick’s reign brought a quick and hassle-free qualification for the World Cup with seven wins out of seven. While Germany’s results in the Nations League matches have not been the same, the World Cup squad is full of quality and has a balance of youth and experience. .It is certainly the last World Cup for the likes of captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller. Both have had stellar World Cup runs. Muller, in particular, was a star for his side during the 2010 and 2014 tournaments. He has 10 World Cup goals, one Best Young Player award, one Golden Boot award, one Silver Boot award and was part of the World Cup All-Star XI in 2014. .He didn’t do much during his side’s terrible showing in 2018, and will be looking to make up for it in his fourth and possibly final World Cup. .But Flick’s side is not dependent on Muller’s form. The likes of Ilkay Gundogan, Joshua Kimmich and Jamal Musiala are well-equipped to run the show from the midfield. The front line includes 2014 final hero Mario Gotze, dependable forward Kai Havertz and Serge Gnabry – all of whom are capable of scoring goals. .While Germany might not be among the outright favourites this time around, fans of the Die Mannschaft will settle for nothing less than a record-equalling fifth title. .Despite being in a tricky group that includes Costa Rica, Japan and Spain, Germany should progress to the round of 16 and possibly reach the semi-finals. As the saying goes, never count out the Germans.",541
542,Published On 18 Nov 2022,World Cup organisers say beer won’t be sold at stadiums in Qatar,Alcohol will still be available to those in hospitality areas and also at the FIFA Fan Festival in central Doha.,".Football World Cup organisers have announced that alcoholic drinks will not be offered for sale at stadium sites in Qatar, just two days before the event starts. .The decision on Friday was a reversal of the original plan for major tournament sponsor Budweiser to sell beer around the eight sites, within the ticketing perimeter, for three hours before and one hour after each game. .The new policy means only non-alcoholic beer will be sold at the venues. .Alcohol including champagne and whisky will still be available to those in hospitality areas, and beer will be on tap at the FIFA Fan Festival in central Doha. Licensed bars will also sell alcohol, while permanent residents with a special permit can purchase it from designated liquor stores in the country. .The World Cup, the first to be held in the Middle East, kicks off on Sunday, with Qatar facing Ecuador. . .In a statement, a spokesperson for world football’s governing body FIFA said the decision was taken following discussions with Qatari authorities. .“Host country authorities and FIFA will continue to ensure that the stadiums and surrounding areas provide an enjoyable, respectful and pleasant experience for all fans,” read the statement. .The news of the announcement began filtering in at Souq Waqif, a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. .“We were sitting here having a meal [when] our phones were suddenly flooded [with] messages saying alcohol won’t be allowed,” Steve Da Cruz, a fan from Mexico, told Al Jazeera. “It’s very disappointing because beer and football go hand-in-hand for us. I know it’s the local culture and we respect all cultures, but a big number of fans coming here can’t imagine going to a football match where they won’t be able to have a beer.” .But Abdullah, a resident of Qatar from Egypt, said he was “happy” to hear the news. .“It’s not like alcohol is not sold in Qatar,” he told Al Jazeera. “People have to respect Muslim culture and get on with the tournament. I’ll feel much better about taking my family to the stadium now,” said Abdullah, who is supporting Brazil in the tournament. . .Budweiser’s parent company, AB InBev, is reported to pay $75m at each World Cup every four years for exclusive rights to sell beer. .Reports said the company, one of the world’s largest brewers, has already shipped the majority of its stock from Britain to Qatar in expectation of selling its product to fans. .“Tournament organisers appreciate AB InBev’s understanding and continuous support to our joint commitment to cater for everyone during the FIFA World Cup,” the statement by the FIFA spokesperson said. .Following the announcement, an AB InBev spokesperson said “some of the planned stadium activations cannot move forward due to circumstances beyond our control”. .The company’s statement added: “As partners of FIFA for over three decades, we look forward to our activations of FIFA World Cup campaigns around the world to celebrate football with our consumers. ” .The brewer’s partnership with FIFA started at the 1986 tournament in Mexico and they are in negotiations for renewing their deal for the next World Cup, in North America. .Some restrictions on alcohol sales in stadiums are not unusual. In the English Premier League, for example, beer can be sold in football grounds, but must be consumed in specific areas and not taken within view of the pitch. In Brazil, beer sales were banned in stadiums in 2003, though the law was changed when the country hosted the World Cup in 2014. France’s Ligue 1 also does not allow alcohol inside stadiums. .Additional reporting by Hafsa Adil in Doha",542
543,Published On 18 Nov 2022,Football and fried chicken: Saudi Al Baik spreads wings in Qatar,"The World Cup aside, there are dozens of cultural events, entertainment planned – and then there’s the food.",".Doha, Qatar – People wait patiently in long queues in a barren, dusty area behind a metro station in Doha for a taste of delectable fried chicken from a well-known Saudi Arabian fast food chain. .In the run-up to the World Cup 2022 in Qatar, Al Baik rolled in with four food trucks, setting up shop behind the Messila metro station in the capital. .The menu is limited but the queues are serpentine. It takes 20 minutes to get to the counter where you can place your order, and an additional 30 minutes before you can get your hands on their famous broasted chicken and a side of fries. .Broasted? That’s chicken that has been well-seasoned in secret spices, rolled in batter and then pressure-fried, with the moisture nicely locked in. .Even though there is not much to choose from, the customers are happy, their excitement only building as they approach the pick-up counters. .The atmosphere is festive. People are singing songs and waving flags despite the presence of traffic wardens to maintain order and cones to ensure everyone stays in line. Security guards encourage those waiting to be patient, telling them the food will be worth it. .There has been great anticipation since Al Baik posted videos showing their food trucks leaving for Qatar ahead of football’s biggest international event, which kicks off on Sunday. .Residents could not wait for the trucks to arrive, find a suitable parking spot – which is always an issue in Qatar – and open for business. .Doubly eager were those who had experienced the food in Saudi Arabia, especially during the Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages. The Umrah to Islam’s two holiest sites in the cities of Mecca and Medina can be undertaken at any time of the year, the Hajj takes place once annually. .For others, who had never tasted Al Baik’s food, but only heard about the hype from friends and colleagues, it was something new to savour and look forward to. .“I have no idea what it tastes like but I saw videos on TikTok showing big crowds so I thought it must be good,” Mohammad Subair, from India, tells Al Jazeera as he patiently waits for his turn to order. .There is only one item on the menu: A chicken nuggets meal. Subair’s wife and young son look on as he orders a mix of spicy and plain meals from one of the six men working behind the numerous counters. .Mohammad waits by the barricades as his friends collect their orders. He is a civil engineer from Sudan, but a football fan above all. .He has snapped up tickets for several matches, bought the jerseys of his favourite players and attended the test event for the FIFA Fan Festival as he ticks off activities on his checklist. Al Baik is one of them. .He is eating this famous chicken for the second time, and has an important question for the food company: “Why did they have to wait until the World Cup to bring it here?” .The answer lies partly in the Gulf crisis that began in June 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut all diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar and imposed an air, land and sea blockade. It lasted three-and-a-half years with the four countries accusing Qatar of supporting “terrorism” and claiming it was too close to Iran. .But the borders have now opened to allow Saudi residents to enter Qatar and be a part of a tournament that all of the Arab world now wants to call its own. .“This (Al Baik’s opening) a sign that this World Cup is going to be beneficial for every country in the Middle East,” says Asad Shaikh, who works in IT support for the tournament’s organising committee. .He has just returned from Saudi Arabia after a quick trip to Mecca, where he first tried Al Baik. .He’s happy to report that the chicken tastes the same on both sides of the border. .As he answers a video call from his family in India, he pans the camera to show them the groups of men and women, big and small families cheerfully walking away with bags full of chicken. .Zayd Al-Jaber, who has been to the chain’s outlets in Saudi Arabia and Dubai, says the queues are not going any time soon. .“I have seen the craze for this chicken everywhere. Even pilgrims going to Mecca and Medina make a trip to Al Baik a part of their itinerary. It seems to be a part of their pilgrimage.” .Sara Abed, who is from Palestine but has lived in Qatar all her life, is here with her mother, aunt and cousins. After finishing their second Al Baik meal in two days, the women stay on to chat about the World Cup and what it has brought to Qatar’s residents besides football action. .“For families who are not going to the matches, there are still so many entertainment options to choose from,” says Sara’s aunt, Eeman, and the women nod in unison. .The only problem, they say, is that Qatar has never dealt with crowds of this magnitude and that is where it could go haywire for the organisers. .Yet, despite some apprehensions, the general mood among residents is one of pride, and a sense of ownership for an event they have helped put together in some way. .The food trucks definitely add to the entertainment options for residents, tourists and football fans as Qatar gets all dressed up for the event. .Workers taking a break from their shift say that Al Baik will make its presence permanent and bring the full menu in two months. They expect the queues to only get longer.",543

And they are looking to change that poor record. .In August, when former Moroccan international Walid Regragui took over as manager of the Atlas Lions, he recalled star player Hakim Ziyech who was frozen out of the team by predecessor Vahid Halilhodžić, into the fold. .That decision may prove to be a masterstroke if Ziyech, who also barely featured for his team Chelsea, in the English top-flight, can reproduce the magic that made him a fan favourite at his former club Ajax Amsterdam and gave him iconic status at the country level. .But it is superstar right-back Achraf Hakimi, who many may be looking to, to power Morocco, the second-highest ranked African team in world football, to a decent showing this time. .His brilliant consistency for the national team and his clubs – Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, and Paris Saint Germain – over the last three seasons have been well noted, even as some of his compatriots have floundered this year. .Hakimi’s trademark bombings down the flanks and pinpoint crosses will be key for the sleek attack of Ziyech, Sofiane Boufal, and Youssef En-Nesyri as they navigate one of the toughest groups in the competition. .If they all click and replicate their form of losing just once in their last eight games, they could stand a chance of causing an upset in Qatar. .On Thursday, the team gave a taste of what is to come with a 3-0 thrashing of Georgia, with one goal apiece for the front trio. Of note was the second, an impressive goal from the Moroccan half of the pitch by Ziyech. .Their compatriots – all 37 million of them – will be hoping for similarly inspired performances from November 23 when the team faces Croatia, and afterwards.",544

Club officials previously said Mane had sustained minor nerve damage and speculated that he would recover in time for the World Cup. .On Thursday, however, Senegal’s team doctor announced Mane would not be playing in the World Cup, warning that he required immediate surgery. .“Unfortunately, today’s MRI shows us that the improvement is not as favourable as we imagined and unfortunately, we have to withdraw Sadio from the World Cup,” said team doctor Manuel Afonso. .By Thursday evening, Bayern Munich confirmed that the ex-Liverpool forward had successfully undergone surgery, stating doctors had reattached a ruptured tendon to his right fibula. They added that Mane will return to Munich to begin rehabilitation in a few days. . .A number of football fans also took the opportunity to blast FIFA for holding a World Cup in the middle of club football season. . . .Mane has not yet publicly commented on his injuries. .The forward was a driving force in Senegal’s World Cup qualifying victory over Egypt in March. He scored the winning penalty at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon in February, as well, also over Egypt. .Before his injury, some football experts had declared Senegal was Africa’s “best hope” at bringing home a World Cup in 2022 — largely due to Mane’s dominance. .“I think Senegal offers Africa’s best hope,” South African football commentator Mark Gleeson told Al Jazeera earlier this month. “I hope that they can get to the quarter[finals], but it depends who they have to play, of course, in the round of 16. I do see them going through, and I think they’ll be the only African side to do so.” .Without the star forward, it is unclear how Senegal — which are nevertheless stacked with a number of players, who have established themselves in Europe, such as Edouard Mendy, Idrissa Gueye, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Ismaila Sarr, Abdou Diallo and Boulaye Dia — will fare. .“Senegal is going to Qatar with the ambition to win and that is our mentality,” Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly previously told Al Jazeera. .Senegal sent the football world into a frenzy during their World Cup debut in 2002 when they upset France to qualify for the quarter-finals, becoming only the second African team to do so at the time. .At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the team had an underwhelming performance, however, as it became the first team in tournament history to be eliminated for disciplinary reasons.",545
546,Published On 18 Nov 2022,The eight lesser-known football World Cup heroes,"They aren’t called Maradona, Pele or Zidane. But they made a name for themselves on football’s greatest stage.",".As we move closer to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, fans across the world will reminisce about legends of the game, including Diego Maradona, Pele, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo. .The effect they had on previous tournaments, and the rest of the football calendar, is immense. .But, as special as those icons are, the World Cup has helped produce many inspiring stories that have written lesser-known players into footballing history. .Here are eight World Cup cult heroes who are often fondly remembered for what they achieved on the biggest international stage in the world of football. .The hero of Italy’s 2006 victory came from an unlikely source in left-back Fabio Grosso. .Manager Marcello Lippi’s decision to start Grosso at the back paid off. Grosso won a last-minute penalty against Australia in the round-of-16 which Francesco Totti converted, sending the Italians into the quarter-finals. He then scored a 119th-minute extra-time winner against Germany in the semi-finals, his curling strike passing German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. .Grosso went on to score the winning penalty in the final shootout against France, helping Italy lift their fourth World Cup trophy. .Admired across Italy, in 2006 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, the highest accolade in the country. .Grosso went on to play for Inter Milan, Lyon and Juventus before hanging up his boots in 2012. Now 44, he is the manager of Serie B side Frosinone. .Goalkeeper Tim Krul sealed the Netherlands’s 4-3 victory over Costa Rica in the 2014 quarter-finals. .As the game entered the final minute of extra time, Dutch coach Louis van Gaal decided to substitute Krul for Jasper Cillessen for the penalty shootout. .Krul saved two penalties and sent the Netherlands into the semi-finals. He remains the only goalkeeper to ever be subbed on solely for a penalty shootout in the World Cup. .Now 34, Krul has since had a successful goalkeeping career in England with Newcastle United and Norwich City. .Forward Paolo Rossi was not your typical striker at the 1982 World Cup. .His slight build, frail stature and earlier match-fixing allegations stirred controversy when he was called up for the national side. .But he went on to score a memorable hat-trick against Brazil in a 3-2 win to advance to the semi-finals where he scored both of Italy’s goals against Poland. .His hero status was secured in the finals as Italy beat Germany 3-1, with Rossi scoring the opening goal. He finished the tournament as the top goal scorer and won the Golden Boot. .Rossi scored three goals at the 1978 World Cup. But two years later, he was caught up in the Totonero match-fixing scandal while playing for Perugia and was banned from football for three years. With his sentence shortened to two years, Juventus decided to sign him in 1982, a move that drew strong criticism as he was deemed unfit and not good enough to play for his country. .Rossi retired from football in 1987 and became a television pundit along with delving into the real estate business. He died in December 2020 after a battle with lung cancer. .The most underrated story from the 1994 World Cup is probably that of Russian forward Oleg Salenko. .The former Valencia and Rangers’ forward only played eight games for Russia, scoring six goals – five of them came in one match against Cameroon in a 6-1 victory, setting a World Cup record for the most goals in a single game. .He scored one more goal in a 3-1 defeat of Sweden, finishing the tournament as joint top scorer despite only playing three games. .Salenko remains the only player to win the Golden Boot in a team eliminated at the group stage. .After retiring in 2001, Salenko, now 53, went on to manage the Ukraine national beach football team in 2003, before stepping back from the sport to focus on his business ventures. .Brazilian right-back Josimar was uncapped by Seleção when he was selected for the 1986 World Cup squad. .Unknown outside Brazil, he was picked by coach Telê Santana as a back-up. The defender was called into action for Brazil’s final group game against Northern Ireland after first choice right-back Édson was injured. .Despite making his international debut, Josimar’s strike left Northern Ireland’s goalkeeper Pat Jennings helpless. His goal in the next game helped Brazil dispatch Poland 4-0. .Josimar played for Botafogo until 1988 before moving to Spanish side Sevilla. The right-back returned to Brazil where he played in the lower leagues until his retirement in 1997. Now 61, he’s an assistant manager at Botafogo. .Forward Diego Forlán is remembered for his outstanding performance at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The former Atlético Madrid and Manchester United player finished as joint top-scorer and was also awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player. .Forlán helped Uruguay reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1970. Uruguay’s Number 10 was one of the few players at the tournament able to use the Jabulani ball effectively. .The Jabulani triggered controversy with many players criticising its unpredictability and awkwardness. But Forlán requested an Adidas Jabulani ball three months before the event, practising and working on free kicks. .His preparation paid off, as he scored goals against South Africa, Ghana, the Netherlands and Germany. .Forlán continued to play until 2018 before retiring at Hong Kong club Kitchee. Now 43, he has most recently managed Uruguayan side Atenas. .Roger Milla is regarded as one of the trailblazers of African football. .The Cameroonian forward’s four goals at the 1990 World Cup, when he was 38, helped his country reach the quarter-finals, the furthest an African side has reached at a World Cup. .Milla also featured at the 1994 World Cup. At 42, he scored against Russia, making him the oldest player to ever score a World Cup goal. .Milla retired from football in 1996 and managed Cameroonian club Tonnerre between 2007 to 2011. .The 70-year-old is now an itinerant ambassador for various African causes, such as promoting environmental issues on the continent and works with groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature. .During the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, French striker Just Fontaine scored 13 goals, the most in a single tournament. .Known for his clinical finishing and his two-footedness, Fontaine had only played five games in as many years for France prior to being called up for the 1958 event. .He scored in all six games France played as they finished in third place, beating West Germany in the playoff, in which Fontaine scored four goals. The striker also scored a hat-trick against Paraguay, braces against Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland and one goal against Brazil and Scotland. .The closest any player has managed to matching Fontaine’s record was Ronaldo in 2002, who scored eight goals en route to Brazil lifting their fifth World Cup trophy. .Fontaine’s career was cut short because of a knee injury, forcing him to retire at 28. .He went on to manage France, Paris Saint-Germain and Morocco. Fontaine, now 89, co-founded the National Union of Professional Football Players – the main trade union for professional football players in France – in 1961 with former footballer Eugène N’Jo Léa.",546

Scaloni’s first order of business was changing that. .Out went ageing players and in came young, hungry hopefuls as Scaloni implemented his vision for a successful team that would later be nicknamed “La Scaloneta” – the house Scaloni built. .Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, centre-back Cristian Romero and midfielder Rodrigo De Paul formed the spine of the new-look team as Scaloni found players capable of taking some of the burden off Lionel Messi’s shoulders. .Their possession-based game, with players such as Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Paredes and De Paul dictating the tempo, freed Messi to be involved further up the pitch where he is most lethal. .Their talisman has been encouraged by Scaloni’s changes and tactical acumen, growing more determined to perform well for Argentina and even playing through injury in the Copa America semis and final. .“Scaloni is one of us,” Messi said. “It was he who selected the national team, the one who believed, the one who took charge at a difficult moment. He gave us confidence, he was bringing in new people, he always knew what he wanted and we grew. From the Copa America 2019, we took a leap.” .The 35-year-old was the best player at the 2014 World Cup when he came agonisingly close to replicating Diego Maradona’s success by leading Argentina to World Cup glory, only to be beaten in the final by a superior Germany team. .Messi is the sole surviving member from that starting lineup at the Maracana Stadium. But this time he has the support of a squad built by Scaloni to win not just matches, but titles. .Argentina is grouped with Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland.",548
549,Published On 18 Nov 2022,The Qatar World Cup is about to shatter colonial myths,"Instead of mimicking ex-colonial powers, the event can help decolonise biased thinking about Arab and Muslim cultures.",".Qatar will soon make history. On Sunday, it will become the smallest country ever to host the world’s biggest sporting event. To appreciate the contrast, think of the vast countries that hosted the previous two iterations of the FIFA World Cup: Russia and Brazil. .While the “soft power” and “smart power” in Qatar’s diplomatic inventory have been credited by many for this moment, the World Cup deserves to be looked at through more than just the lens of international relations. As postcolonial scholars like Edward Said and Gayatri Spivak (PDF) have argued, the Euro-American imagination has long dictated what is “good” while determining how the Oriental “other” is represented. .The World Cup offers a chance to reset those narratives. .After all, there is something magical about the World Cup happening in Qatar. Since winning the bid to host the 22nd edition of the World Cup, Doha has been readying itself for the global showpiece, putting income from its hydrocarbon industry to good use modernising the country’s infrastructure – especially roads, transportation and technology. .Qataris have increasingly transformed themselves into avid information technology users. Doha continues to be modernised at a swift pace, from a pearling village into a smart city and home to diverse expatriate communities. It is equipped with state-of-the-art technology, giving Qataris greater digital accessibility and connectivity, whether in e-governance, efficient banking or health. .Yet while football fields are supposed to inspire international unity and a spirit of sportsmanship, there is no escape from constructions of otherness in global encounters like football’s biggest carnival. In this case, that shows in the systematic, relentless and racially prejudiced campaign in the West against Qatar in the years leading up to this World Cup. .How else can one explain the manner in which Qatar has been subject to vilification like no host before it? Not other small nations with extreme weather, such as Switzerland in 1954. Not superpowers like the United States, where the Los Angeles area hosted the World Cup final in 1994, just two years after witnessing some of the country’s worst race riots in decades. Not Mussolini’s fascist regime and Argentina’s brutal military junta. Not Brazil, where people living in favelas were evicted as the country looked to hide its poverty from fans travelling for the 2014 World Cup. Not Russia, which held the 2018 event amid rising homophobia. .These countries were seen as legitimate hosts – no matter what they did – because, somehow, football was and is seen as belonging to them. By contrast, Qatar was viewed with disdain the moment it won its bid, treated as an outsider gatecrashing a party of the elite. .In fact, like other Arab, Asian, African and South and Central American nations, football came to Qatar via colonialism, when the country was a British protectorate between 1916 and 1971. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), the precursor to British Petroleum (BP), began oil exploration and production in the late 1930s. Football followed in the 1940s. The Doha Stadium was the first football arena with a grass pitch in the Gulf region. League competition started in the 1960s, several years before independence. .Ironically, postcolonialism studies have had little to say about football – even though many of the slums of former colonies have produced major stars, from Pele in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to Raheem Sterling in Kingston, Jamaica. Many Arab players – from Algeria’s Rabah Madjer to Egypt’s Mohamed Salah – have made similar journeys to Europe’s rich clubs. .The football World Cup must not be simply an exercise in new forms of cultural mimicry of former colonial powers. Even as football in the West struggles to address racism – Brazilian player Richarlison recently had a banana thrown at him in a Paris friendly – the Qatar edition of the World Cup could help decolonise biased thinking about Arab and Muslim societies by using their diverse cultures to enrich the global experience of football. .For instance, Qatar’s alcohol-free stadiums during the World Cup could set an example. They will allow a broader section of people to come to matches without worrying about the alcohol-fueled violence, racism and foul language that’s common in European football arenas. As Qatar hosts fans from around the world, it can showcase an alternative way to enjoy the sport – one that does not import a generic experience of being a football fan while ignoring Qatar’s local values. .Qataris are accustomed to living with foreigners and the World Cup is yet another chance to display their affinity with multiculturalism to counter the Western stereotype of the “fanatic Muslim” – as seen recently in Islamophobic and racist French cartoons depicting Qatar’s national team. .By presenting an alternative narrative to the way both the Muslim world and football have been viewed in the West, this World Cup could help decolonise the language of the sport. “European football” is not white. “African” or “Arab” football are not signs of colour or of ethnicity. Yet these labels are used as codes for dominant ethnicities and races far too often in the way the sport is covered. .That’s where postcolonialism can serve as an antidote, by placing – to paraphrase Harvard University professor and critical theorist Homi K Bhabha – the ex-colonised in-between different worlds and outlooks. .The Arab world is full of literary minds that have tackled stereotypical representations and unequal encounters in their work – and that can serve as inspiration as the region looks to host the world on its terms. Sudanese writer Tayeb Salih’s 1966 book Season of Migration to the North captures the essence of the in-betweenness that Bhabha highlights. .The brilliant Saudi Arabian novelist Abdulrahman Munif coined a special term: al-teeh (loss, confusion). His classic compound novel of five stories, Cities of Salt (Mudun al-Milh, published in 1984), is one of the best examples of postcolonial literary studies. It tells a tale of political, economic, environmental and cultural devastation when neo-coloniser (American capitalism and petrodollars) and neo-colonised (the Gulf) meet. .These writings are poignant reminders that hosting and organising the FIFA World Cup is an occasion for much more than parading Westernised lives. .In colonial times, Arabs fostered anti-colonial resistance by, among other things, wearing local dress and ensuring that they preserved their traditional culture. Today, they don the Arab “thobe” (ankle-long tunic) made from fabric that hails from Japan. That reflects the mingling of the global and the local – in a way that Qatar and the Arab world could draw upon as the region hosts major sporting events. .The FIFA World Cup should be a shared space for a new modernity that isn’t white or colonial. A modernity that speaks to Arab, Asian, African, Indigenous and Latin values of tolerance, human rights and good governance, and challenges the stereotypes that are often thrust upon the Global South. .A modernity that seeks a more just, equitable and – truly – decolonised world, and questions and resists neo-colonising hierarchies. A modernity that demands rights to cultural self-determination, and asserts shared futures and experiences on terms of mutual respect. .Through Qatar’s World Cup, “the beautiful game” can help subvert colonising tendencies and cultural narcissism in our multicultural world. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",549

554,Published On 17 Nov 2022,"World Cup 2022 buzz builds as Qatar welcomes football stars, fans",Residents as well as fans from across the world are ready for action on and off the field at football’s biggest spectacle.,".Doha, Qatar – The moment Qatar has been waiting for since 2010 is here: the 2022 FIFA World Cup is ready for kickoff. .But ahead of Sunday’s opening game, the excitement is palpable across the Gulf nation. .Fans are dancing on the streets, replica football jerseys are selling out like sugary karak (milk tea), strings of miniature flags adorn corner shops, front yards, schools and skyscrapers are draped in gigantic posters of football heroes. .“I see more and more new faces on the street every day,” Bernard Wanjiku, a shop owner from Kenya, told Al Jazeera at his Africa-focused outlet in the old, bustling neighbourhood of Mansoura. .From African clothes and accessories to beauty products, Butterfly Beauty Shop claims to have it all. The shop has undergone a mini-transformation to match the occasion. Wanjiku is now selling football flags, stickers, badges, wigs and jerseys and looks pleased with how business is doing. .“When I started selling flags, Argentina, Brazil and Qatar were the most popular countries,” he shouts over the sound of World Cup anthems blaring from his radio. .“Now there is a sudden demand for African flags and jerseys. Ghana, Senegal and Morocco are the most popular. In fact, I have almost run out of Ghana flags,” he adds holding up one of the last remaining flags of the Black Stars. .Mansoura is home to lower to middle-income communities from Africa, South Asia and the Philippines. The area has gone through a recent transformation with the introduction of a metro station, construction of new shops and residential buildings, and roadworks. .Given its central location, Mansoura is a few metro stops away from several World Cup stadiums. Stadium 974 is the closest at six kilometres away, a mere 10-minute drive or three stops on the metro. .Taxi drivers stop for a quick one-riyal cup of karak, while many of the mainly South Asian youth relax at street corners – and make World Cup predictions – after a hard day’s work. It is a vibrant, multicultural neighbourhood. .Musheireb, the oldest district in the capital Doha, and home to the first fully lit street in the country, is now a sparkling clean new downtown area. .Single-storey mud houses, baqaalas (corner shops) and restaurants dating back to the 1970s once stood here. But narrow streets clogged with traffic are a thing of the past. They have been replaced with a purpose-built tram system and tall buildings that house five-star hotels and high-end restaurants. .The construction and refurbishment that began after Qatar won the hosting rights to the World Cup came to an end a few weeks ago. Last-minute fixes and paint jobs in hotels and museum buildings indicate that the finishing touches are still under way. .Fans who come to the new Musheireb Downtown area can expect to catch all the football action on big screens, delve into Qatar’s history with exhibitions and screenings about its history, cheer on the home team at al-Annabi Village – which hosts immersive experiences and exhibitions tracing Qatar’s football history, or admire the various art and culture exhibitions including Frida Kahlo Immersive Biography and Forever Valentino, a tribute to the Italian fashion house. .A less-than-kilometre walk across Musheireb takes you to Souq Waqif which has long been the central and most popular tourist hub in Doha. Now, it has turned into a 24-hour party zone teeming with fans from across the world. .Meanwhile, the vast Al-Bidda Park, which is the venue for the FIFA Fan Festival, is a 20-minute walk from the Souq, while the Corniche waterfront area is less than a kilometre to the west. Barricades and police units surrounding the park, the Souq and the Corniche are visible from a distance as the area has been pedestrianised to ease crowd movement during the World Cup. .If you look up from al-Bidda Park at night, you’ll be able to see a couple of footballers passing a ball in the sky. Next, the lights flit and flicker, writing “Welcome to Qatar”. Drone displays, fireworks and light shows are among the dozens of nighttime displays planned to enthral fans during the tournament. .On the ground, fan parades have become a common sight along the Corniche. Men, women and children of all ages and nationalities gather in large groups to dance, cheer and sing for their favourite teams – with Brazil, Argentina, Morocco, Senegal and England the most popular so far. .While these fans have been termed “fake” or “borrowed” by some international news outlets, it has done little to dampen their spirits. They love football – Messi is one standout idol – regardless of their origin. .Draped in national flags of all colours, they descend on hubs such as the main boulevard in Lusail city, home to Lusail Stadium, and march in their hundreds to the beating of drums. .“I am Qatari but I am supporting Argentina,” says Sara al-Haji, a Qatari media student. “It’s simple. I love Leo Messi and so does my mother.” .Sarah and her friends from Qatar University have set up a stall in the Katara Cultural Village, a hub that is host to art galleries, an amphitheatre, restaurants and a beach, located a 10-minute drive or metro ride from downtown Doha. .To anyone who stops by, Sarah offers Arabic coffee, biscuits, and a chance to learn more about Qatari and Islamic culture. .“We felt the need to change the image of Qatar and Islam in the eyes of the West,” adds Sara’s friend Dalal. Their small set-up includes a World Cup-themed activity corner offering team colouring sheets, stickers, badges and flags for children. .“We have had quite a few Argentinian fans stop by to try our coffee and have a chat. They made TikTok videos about Qatar and said they will root for our team.” .From fashion shows to concerts and theatre performances, to children’s activities and amusement parks there’s an event taking place in every part of the country. Schools and nurseries have marked an early end of term with World Cup parties of their own. .Children, kitted out in their favourite team’s colours have been dancing to the tournament soundtrack and holding cardboard versions of World Cup trophies aloft. .Excitement levels are rising, the festivities are in full swing and the teams are arriving.

It took an extra-time goal from winger Karl Toko Ekambi in the second leg of a tie against Algeria to qualify, and only on the away goals rule. .Controversy has also trailed the selection of the World Cup squad after coach Rigobert Song had difficulty reading some names during the announcement, leading to speculation of interference from Eto’o, in the local media. .All of this has made Song’s task of getting out of a group with Switzerland, Serbia and pre-tournament favourites Brazil a Herculean one. .To spearhead what may seem like a “mission impossible” are goalkeeper Andre Onana and star midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa who both play in the Italian Serie A, as well as captain and veteran forward Vincent Aboubakar of Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr FC. .Zambo Anguissa, the team’s defensive linchpin, is an extremely skilled player with an eye for a goal to match.

Group stage fixtures: South Korea (November 24), Portugal (November 28), Ghana (December 2) .A lot has changed for Uruguay in the four years since the 2018 World Cup. Their manager of 15 years is gone, the youth core has matured and the two key figures of the past decade are in the twilight of their careers. .The road to Qatar was a bumpy one for La Celeste, who were at risk of missing out on qualification at one stage. But they arrive at the tournament with high hopes. .“Uruguay will always try to compete at the World Cup to the maximum, to try to go as far as possible and why not be champions? Because we have the players for that,” said the country’s top scorer, Luis Suarez .“Even though we know the difficulty that every game in the World Cup presents, we always believe in it,” he said. .One of the biggest changes for Uruguay this time will be the absence of Oscar Tabarez on the touchline. .The man fondly known as “El Maestro” had been at the helm for 15 years and had overseen the team’s qualification in the previous three World Cups, including a third-place finish in 2010. .But Tabarez was sacked after a poor start to their campaign for the 2022 World Cup, which saw them slip to seventh in the qualification table. .His replacement, former Atletico Madrid striker Diego Alonso, had an immediate impact. Uruguay won all of their four remaining games and sealed qualification. .Unsurprisingly, Suarez was the star performer for Uruguay in the qualifiers. He was the second-highest scorer, and his eight goals put him ahead of Lionel Messi and Neymar. .Who’s in their group? 
Uruguay have been drawn in Group H alongside Portugal, Ghana and South Korea. While it is a challenging group, La Celeste have beaten each of these three teams in recent World Cups. They knocked Portugal out of the tournament in 2018 and beat South Korea in their round of 16 encounter in 2010. .But the tie of the group is undoubtedly their game against Ghana. .The last time the two met was in the quarter-final of the 2010 World Cup, which is best remembered for Suarez’s goal-line save with his hands in the last minute of extra time to prevent a certain Ghana goal. .It is one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history. .Suarez was sent off for the offence, but Ghana missed the subsequent penalty and went on to lose the game in the penalty shootout. Suarez was hailed as a hero in Uruguay, but in Ghana, he remains public enemy number one to this day. The sequel to this 2010 fixture promises to be thrilling. .Past performances and form
Tabarez was appointed as manager in 2006 after the team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup that year. Since then, La Celeste has qualified for every major tournament on their calendar. They’ve made it out of the group stages in each of the past three World Cups and reached the semi-finals in 2010, where they lost to the Netherlands. .Uruguay enter the World Cup in good form: They’ve won seven of their nine games this calendar year, and their 1-0 loss to Iran last month was their first under Alonso. .Players to watch out for .As the inaugural winners of the World Cup and two-time champions, Uruguay has a proud footballing tradition. La Celeste occupies a central place in the nation’s identity, and as is always the case going into a World Cup, fans’ expectations are high. .Suarez believes the raised expectations of the team are down to its young players, who are “playing at the highest level in Europe”. .Rodrigo Bentancur has established himself in Antonio Conte’s Tottenham side, Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo’s emergence over the past year has put veteran Diego Godin’s place under threat and in 24-year-old Fede Valverde, they have one of the most exciting players in the world at the moment. .While the presence of Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez bolsters the attack, the front line continues to be led by the two veteran forwards who’ve been there, done that. .Suarez and Edinson Cavani, both aged 35, have been the protagonists of Uruguay’s success in the past decade, and the World Cup will be their final act. .Between them, they have scored nine of Uruguay’s last 13 World Cup goals. While the hopes of the nation will fall squarely on the pair, it remains to be seen if they are still strong enough to carry them. .",557
558,Published On 17 Nov 2022,Do host countries make money from the World Cup?,"Major global events are costly to stage, and the benefits aren’t always easily quantifiable.",".The football World Cup is the biggest sporting event in the global calendar … ahead even of the Olympics. .More than five billion people are expected to tune in to watch the sporting spectacular in Qatar, with more than a million turning up to watch the games in person. .From ticket and merchandise sales to corporate sponsorship, prize money and tourism, there are immense amounts of money kicking around an event like this. .But, for a host country, is it financially worth it? The short answer is no. .Most countries hosting a World Cup spend tens of billions on preparations, developing infrastructure, building hotels and so on. Much of that is often not recouped, at least not in terms of hard cash. .The World Cup certainly is a money-spinner. TV rights for the 2018 World Cup in Russia were sold to broadcasters around the world for $4.6bn. But that is kept by FIFA, football’s world governing body. .As are ticket sales, which are owned by a subsidiary company 100 percent owned by FIFA. Marketing rights, which brought in more than $1bn in the 2018 cycle are, too, kept by FIFA. .The body does, however, cover the principal costs of running the tournament – it will be paying Qatar in the region of $1.7bn, though that includes a $440m prize pot for teams. .But Qatar is understood to have spent in excess of $200bn on this World Cup and the infrastructure around it – hotels and leisure facilities, overhauling its entire road network and constructing a rail system. .With more than a million overseas visitors expected during the month-long tournament, a host country will see a tourism spike, increasing sales for hoteliers, restaurateurs and the like. But such a surge requires extra capacity to be built, the expense of which is usually far larger than the revenues generated short term. .And who benefits in the short term? .The World Economic Forum reports: “Hotel prices rise during sell-out events, but wages of service workers do not necessarily go up by the same amount, meaning the returns to capital are likely greater than those to labour.” .People with money make money. People without it, don’t. .Furthermore, World Cup tourists buying merchandise, drinks or anything else from FIFA partner brands are not contributing to a host country’s tax revenues, as enormous tax breaks for FIFA and its sponsor brands are required within a World Cup bidding process. .Germany touted $272m in tax breaks in its bid to host the 2006 World Cup. .Non-World Cup tourists tend to stay well clear of a host country during a World Cup, keen to avoid the crowds, traffic and inflated prices. For Qatar 2022, if you don’t have a match ticket, you are unable to enter the country from November 1 to the end of the World Cup. .In the short term at least, it doesn’t make financial sense to host a football World Cup. But some things are bigger than money. .Hosting a World Cup is an exercise in the projection of soft power. It gives the world a window into that country, showing how new infrastructure makes it a good place in which to invest or to do business. .And in the longer term, the money spent on hosting, if managed correctly, builds capacity for that country’s economy to expand. .New roads and transport projects will provide economic benefits for years after the final whistle is blown at a World Cup. .Huge international sporting events bridge societal divides and bring people together across borders – the 2018 Winter Olympics saw North and South Korea enter the stadium under a common flag. These events also encourage children to take up sport – which has economic benefits to a host nation’s healthcare system further down the line. .For a host country, a World Cup is about pride and honour and publicity, more than it is about making money. .Hosting a World Cup is a nation opening its arms and its homes and saying to the world: “Hayya, you are welcome here.”",558

But in the end, the house always wins. .“We can make up to $15,000 a month from each table and we can pay the right people to stay open,” the streetside bookmaker operating the draw told Al Jazeera, asking to remain anonymous. .With the Qatar World Cup kicking off on Sunday, Thailand is bracing for a surge in gambling, which, despite being wildly popular, is illegal outside of a handful of state-approved venues. .While Thailand did not qualify for the tournament, Thais are expected to wager up to $1.6bn on the games, according to researchers at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce. .“World Cup fever will spur a 50-percent increase in gambling newcomers,” Thanakorn Komkris, the secretary of the Stop Gambling Foundation, told Al Jazeera. .“But what’s sad is that about one-quarter of those newcomers will turn into regular gamblers based on our experience with past football tournaments.” .Under Thailand’s 1935 gambling law, betting is illegal outside of the official lottery and a small number of horse racing tracks. .Authorities have long argued that gambling runs against the principles of Buddhism, Thailand’s majority religion, and encourages other social ills to flourish. .Still, illegal casinos, online betting shops, underground lotteries and pop-up bookies taking bets on everything from cockfighting to Muay Thai are pervasive, forming a shadow economy worth billions of dollars a year. .The COVID-19 pandemic and technology have made gambling easier than ever, said Thanakorn, the anti-gambling activist, with people short of cash turning to illegal websites that have sprung up across the Southeast Asian country. .“More than one million Thais identify as pathological gamblers,” he said. .“Some fall out with families because they have to borrow money, but many others turn to loan sharks who are often tied to illegal football websites … they are entwined like a web.” .Ahead of the World Cup, Thai police said last week they had closed down 500 websites linked to a nationwide gambling syndicate known as “Fat Fast.” Authorities seized nearly $13m in assets as part of the raids, local media reported. .Jun, a 34-year-old office worker in Bangkok, knows first-hand the temptations that accompany World Cup fever. .He lost about 40,000 baht ($1,120) – several times an average month’s salary – during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, during which he wagered up to 2,000 baht ($55.70) on each match. Despite his losses, Jun plans to have a flutter this time around as well. .“But with the unstable economy I don’t think I can risk that much this time,” he said. “I just want to take part, it makes watching the games so much more interesting.” .Like many Thais, Jun places his bets with neighbourhood motorcycle taxi drivers, who act as streetside agents for the underground bookies that ply their trade in almost every community. .But he says the real money is to be won – and lost – online, where millions of baht can be at stake. .Many of those companies are based along the Thai border with Cambodia, according to authorities. .The Center for Gambling Studies at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University has estimated that these gambling sites have created up to 700,000 new gamblers this year alone. .The Thai money moving through these websites – as well as the proliferation of casinos in neighbouring Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar – has led some legislators to float the idea of amending the 1935 Gambling Act to allow licensed casinos. .In June, parliament heard a debate on the issue, which led to the establishment of a committee to assess an easing of the law. If successful, the push to bring gambling out of the shadows would break longstanding taboos and potentially bring in billions of dollars in tax revenues currently flowing into illicit businesses. .Opponents argue that the businesses that win the licenses to operate will inevitably grow so big, so fast that authorities will struggle to rein them in, especially if they are accompanied by illicit activities such as prostitution, human trafficking, drugs and money-lending. .Activists such as Thanakorn have also argued any legal changes must be preceded by a robust debate about the health and social consequences in a nation already obsessed with betting. .“There’s no way this is a good idea,” Thutchakrit Wongpanaporn, an ex-gambler who runs a YouTube channel dedicated to warning people of the dangers of gambling addiction, told Al Jazeera. .“Unless Thailand can regulate gambling like other Western countries, I just don’t see it,” said Wongpanaporn, popularly known as Sia Joe, who lost more than $1.5m to his addiction. “The government has to control online gambling first before thinking about legalisation of casinos.” .There are also fears about who would take control of the gambling business, with casinos in neighbouring Cambodia and Laos gaining a notorious reputation as hotbeds for online scams run by Chinese criminal gangs. .“In a ‘dark business’ like gambling, which has ties to criminal activities, there is no regulator strong or serious enough to handle it,” Wongpanaporn said. .To gamblers like Jun, though, legalisation could only be a good thing. Whatever its drawbacks, it would at least free millions of Thais from the threat of legal sanction. .“The thing is in Thailand, gambling is part of our DNA,” he said.",559
560,Published On 17 Nov 2022,The biggest shocks ever witnessed at the football World Cup,Nothing makes the news like a low-ranked or unfancied team putting up its best performance to defeat a big name.,".The football World Cup 2022 is the most eagerly awaited sports event of the year. .Fans are gearing up to see which team wins the coveted trophy, who scores the most goals, and who are the biggest performers on the grand stage. .But while there is great anticipation to see who ends up being the best, another aspect of the tournament that always leaves the spectators in awe is upsets on the field. .In some shock results at the World Cup, defending champions have been knocked out in the group stages, minnows have thrashed historical giants of the game and, on some occasions, the shock has not been at the result but at the sheer lack of effort, and the resulting score. .Following Saudi Arabia’s stunning upset of Argentina in Qatar, here are some of the other major upsets in the World Cup’s history: .The post-war England team, comprising the likes of Alf Ramsey, Tom Finney and Billy Wright, was among the favourites to lift the trophy as it made its World Cup debut. The Americans, meanwhile, put together a group of part-timers, including a dishwasher, a letter carrier and a teacher. The mixed bunch practised together for one day and set off on a boat to Brazil. .Joe Gaetjens scored a 38th-minute header to put the USA ahead. In the second half, England’s attack was relentless but USA’s goalkeeper Frank Borghi prevented them from scoring an equaliser and etched his team’s name into the history books. .A West Germany side staging a comeback to win a World Cup match would not be considered an anomaly today. .However, this was a lesser-known West German side of the 1950s facing the Mighty Magyars of Hungary, with football’s first superstar Ferenc Puskas leading their attack. .Hungary entered the World Cup in Switzerland as favourites and lived up to their billing by handing a 9-0 drubbing to South Korea and thrashing West Germany 8-3 in the earlier matches. .The two sides met in the final again. Hungary scored two goals in the first half and were seemingly following the script until the opponents scored two. .The game was tied until the 84th minute when Helmut Rahn scored his second goal and broke Hungarian hearts. The German comeback against one of the best teams in football’s history was termed “The Miracle of Bern”. .The fact that North Korea was able to land its team in England for the World Cup was surprising enough. .The English FA had considered rejecting the North Korean team’s visa amid its cold war against the Western allies’ favoured South Korea. .Italy were held together by Giacomo Bulgarelli on the pitch. The midfielder was injured during the match which reduced the Italian side to 10 men as substitutions were not allowed at the time. .Seven minutes later, Pak Doo Ik scored a goal that not only won his team the match but it also knocked out the two-time world champions. .The match is considered one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history, and its original match ticket is placed in the FIFA football museum. .The spot where the goal was scored has been marked with iron stud marks after the stadium was demolished for a housing estate. .West Germany entered the 1982 World Cup as reigning European champions, former two-time winners and one of the favourites. .The all-star German lineup included Hansi Mueller, Wolfgang Dremmler, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Lothar Matthäus. .Algeria, on the other hand, were a team made up of names unknown in Western football but had been performing well prior to the World Cup. .The nonchalance shown by the Germans turned into complacency. Rabah Madjer scored in the 54th minute to hand the Germans their first shock. .Just as Rummenigge’s goal brought Germany level, a goal that would shock West Germany and the world came from the now-legendary Algerian forward Lakhdar Belloumi. .Holders, favourites and led by the world’s greatest footballer of the time, Diego Maradona, Argentina had a seemingly easy opening match at the 1982 World Cup. .Cameroon were making their World Cup debut and were the only sub-Saharan African country to participate in the tournament. They comprised players that no one knew much about as most played their club football at home. .The opening match of the World Cup was played at the mighty San Siro stadium. .Although Argentina started well, the Cameroonians grew in confidence as the game went on without any damage against them. .Half-way into the second half, Francois Omam-Biyik latched on to a free kick and headed his side into a lead that would stand until the final whistle. .World Cup holders vs debutants: check. .Former colonisers vs colony: check. .Opening game of the tournament: check. .And finally, holders knocked out in first round: check. .The opening game of the 2002 World Cup had all the possible subplots to make for an interesting match. But what the pundits and the French team failed to anticipate was the meticulously planned Senegalese stifling of the French attack. .Add to that the pace of El Hadji Diouf and a 30th-minute goal from Papa Bouba Diop, Senegal found themselves on top of the group at the end of 90 minutes. .France’s journey ended after another loss and a draw. Senegal went on to become only the second African country to qualify for the quarter-finals. .The 2014 World Cup seemed like the perfect opportunity for Brazil to right the wrongs of 1950 when they lost the final against Uruguay at home despite being clear favourites. .The stage was set for football’s biggest party to light up the samba nation with the crowning of Brazil as champions for the sixth time. .It was only a matter of two more matches. Or so thought the Brazilians. .Up against them were Germany, never to be underrated in a World Cup knockout match. Both teams had a similar path to the semi-finals: Topping their groups and having close encounters in the knockouts. .However, Brazil lost their star forward Neymar Jr to injury in the quarterfinal and captain Thiago Silva to yellow card accumulation. .In the semi-final, Germany opened the scoring in the 11th minute and never looked back. Between 23 and 29 minutes, the Germans scored four more goals to stun the Brazilians on the pitch, in the stands and the country. .It didn’t get better after half-time as Brazil’s defences were breached twice, before the home team scored a consolation goal in the last minute. .The final scoreline of 7-1 was Brazil’s biggest defeat since 1920, and brought on titles such as “the Agony of Mineirao” and was termed a national humiliation for the football-mad country. .Germany went on to win the final against Argentina for their fourth title. .The opening game of Group B in the 2014 World Cup pitted the two finalists from the previous World Cup. .Spain entered the tournament as reigning European and world champions and one of the favourites. .When Xabi Alonso opened the scoring in the 27th minute, all seemed to be going well for the star-studded Spanish side. But one minute before half-time came a goal that became the most iconic image of the tournament. .Robin van Persie was 15 yards from the goal when he latched on to a looping ball and scored a stunning header to baffle Iker Casillas and the rest of the Spanish side. .The Dutch went on to score four more goals to hand Spain their second-biggest loss in a World Cup. It was also the biggest loss margin for defending champions in a FIFA World Cup. .Spain were knocked out of the group after another loss while the Netherlands finished the tournament in third place. .Some of the biggest upsets in the World Cup have involved the defending champions being handed first-round defeats and the 2018 tournament was no different. .It was the third consecutive World Cup where the holders were knocked out at the first hurdle. .Germany came into their final group match needing a win to progress. South Korea were playing for pride as they were all but out of the tournament. .Germany have historically been one of the teams that can never be counted out in a World Cup match. The match seemed to be heading to a goalless draw so the Germans amassed all their efforts on scoring a winning goal that would see them through. .However, two minutes into injury time South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored from a corner. Manuel Neuer, German captain and goalkeeper, came out all the way into the Korean half to enforce the attack. .South Korea capitalised by collecting the ball from Neuer’s miscued pass and slotting it into an empty net to seal Germany’s fate. .It was the first time since 1938 that Germany failed to advance beyond the first stage, and their first-ever defeat against an Asian country in a World Cup match.",560

FIFA has included such festival venues as a part of the tournament since the 2006 World Cup in Germany. .Hundreds lined up on Wednesday for the event at Al-Bidda Park, with organisers expecting 20,000 people to attend the test run at the venue, which can hold approximately 40,000 fans. .The venue features a giant screen for the live screening of World Cup matches, with a panoramic view of Doha’s skyline in the backdrop. Food courts, cultural exhibits, and a FIFA museum have also been set up for visiting fans. .John Macintosh, who hails from Scotland but lives in Qatar, said outside the venue on Wednesday that he attended the test run to “get a feel” for what the festival and fan zones will be like during the World Cup. .“We’re here just to see what the place will look like during the World Cup … how it will be organised,” the 51-year old told Al Jazeera, who was there with his wife Maka and two children. .Indian national Ashwin Kumar, 35, who also lives in Qatar, said since the World Cup and associated festivities were happening in his “second home”, he felt he should experience it firsthand. .“I am looking forward to having a good time today and the rest of the month … I have like 13 tickets for the tournament,” he added.",561
562,Published On 16 Nov 2022,Is Qatar ready to host the World Cup 2022?,More than a million fans are expected to visit the Gulf country during the monthlong tournament.,".Doha, Qatar – Fans and football teams have started arriving in Qatar, as the Middle Eastern country prepares to host the World Cup 2022, which will start on Sunday. .More than 1.2 million fans are expected to visit the Gulf country during the tournament. .Qatar, a country of less than three million people, was awarded the right to host the global 32-team competition in 2010. Since then the country has undergone many changes to prepare for the showpiece event. .So, is Qatar ready to host world football’s flagship tournament? .The tournament will be played across eight stadiums. Qatar, the first country in the Middle East to host the tournament, directly employed more than 26,000 people to prepare the stadiums for the November and December games. .Seven new stadiums have been built for the event. The last of the newly built venues to be inaugurated was Lusail Stadium, which hosted a match between Egyptian club team Zamalek and the Saudi club Al Ahli in September. .Lusail Stadium, with a capacity of 80,000 people, is the largest tournament venue for the 2022 World Cup and will host the final on December 18, as well as matches during each stage of the event. .The eighth – the 40,000-capacity Khalifa International Stadium – has undergone renovations and upgrades. .There have been concerns that the country may not have adequate accommodation for the expected influx of football fans during the tournament. Over the past 12 years, the organisers have built hotels, apartments, villas and infrastructure to prepare for the mega event. .The organisers have also allowed residents to put their houses and rooms up for rent in an attempt to ease accommodation concerns. .Fans will also be staying on cruise ships and at sites in the desert. At least three floating hotels have docked in Doha with a combined capacity of about 10,000 beds. .Authorities have also said some fans will be able to stay in 1,000 modern tents erected on a man-made island north of Doha. .Organisers are introducing more than 500 shuttle flights a day allowing fans to stay in cities in neighbouring countries like Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, Muscat in Oman, and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to alleviate concerns over a potential accommodation shortage in Qatar. .In the run-up to the championship, Qatar invested heavily in upgrading its transport network. .The host country built a metro rail system, which was launched in 2019, constructed major highways and inaugurated a tram system in advance of the games. .For holders of a Hayya card – a fan ID that allows ticket-holders entry into Qatar and the stadiums – public transport will be free between November 10 and December 23. .The 2022 tournament will be geographically the most compact World Cup in history, with all eight stadiums within a 55km (34 miles) radius of Doha. Fans will be able to attend more than one game a day if they wish to. However, it has also added to the congestion concerns with the World Cup essentially taking place in one city, the capital Doha. .Five of the eight FIFA World Cup stadiums are directly connected to the metro railway, with the remainder connected by a combination of metro and shuttle bus services. .A fleet of 4,000 buses, including 700 electric vehicles, will be used to shuttle passengers between transport hubs and stadiums. According to organisers, some 50,000 passengers a day are expected to use buses during the World Cup, .Qatar is deploying tens of thousands of security personnel for the World Cup. It has signed security cooperation deals with several countries. .Turkey has provided police officers and Pakistan has sent troops, which will operate under Qatari command. Several participating countries are also sending delegations of police. .Last month, Qatar security forces, along with partners, carried out a five-day security exercise across the country. The drills were aimed at testing the readiness and responsiveness of the emergency services, The Peninsula daily reported. .According to the tournament’s security committee, the exercises, dubbed Watan (which translates to nation in Arabic), involved 32,000 government security personnel and 17,000 from the private security sector.",562

Their second-half response was in vain, even if the result hinged on fine details, including Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois’s fingertips. .The elimination shook Tite and kept him awake at night. Deep down, he is a conservative coach even after he took a sabbatical in 2014 to immerse himself in different coaching schools of the game. .He responded to that defeat by reinforcing his midfield to prevent Brazil from being exposed again. But the team did not rekindle its swagger and spirit of yesteryear. It was as if Tite kept playing out the Belgium match over and over in his head and not even victory in the delayed 2019 Copa America on home soil brought solace. .Brazil played their way to an 11th continental crown, but their laboured style of play failed to impress. .In the World Cup qualifiers, Brazil found some of their mojo again, going unbeaten en route to Qatar, scoring 45 goals and conceding just five. .As impressive as the qualifying campaign was, Brazil and Tite know its significance will be limited when playing the very best at the World Cup. .Brazil have exited the last four world cups early after defeats by European heavyweights – France and Zinedine Zidane in 2006, the Netherlands and Arjen Robben in 2010, Toni Kroos and Germany in 2014, and Belgium and Kevin De Bruyne in 2018. .How will Brazil’s Seleçao Canarinho, react when playing Europe’s elite? The group phase will be a déja vu for Tite. .Once again, Brazil will play Serbia and Switzerland – teams that cannot be underestimated in his view – in the group stages. Four years ago, Tite was obsessed with finding a way to dismantle deep-sitting European defences and his team struggled to dominate in the group stages. .In 2022, the outlook is somewhat different. With the introduction of the UEFA Nations League, Brazil hardly ever get the opportunity to play European opponents, who still represent the litmus test in the international game. .Even so, the five-time world champions will be more confident than ever going into Qatar 2022 because they are no longer solely dependent on Neymar, who is three goals shy of Pelé’s goal-scoring record for Brazil. .The emergence of a new generation of players has taken the weight off the shoulders of Brazil’s lodestar. In the past decades, the 30 year old was the centre of gravity of the Seleção Brasileira, often shouldering all the responsibility while also taking the intense scrutiny but in Vinicius Junior, Richarlison de Andrade or Richarlison and Raphael Dias Belloli (Raphinha) Brazil have a new crop of stars. .From the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro to the Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Vinicius Junior’s story is the quintessential Brazilian rages-to-rich story, but, while taking a gamble to move across the Atlantic at a young age, he has established himself in the starting XI of Madrid and become a mainstay for Brazil, nurturing a fine understanding with Neymar. .Brazil’s attacking talent extends beyond Vinicius and leaves Tite with a luxury problem before Brazil kick off their tournament against Serbia on November 24 at Lusail Stadium … where they will expect to return for the final. .Asked in a recent interview with Brazilian media about playing five attacking players in the World Cup final, Tite said: “I don’t know, it will depend on the opponent’s analysis and how well this team gels. The field does the talking. But if you look at the athletes, Paquetá is competitive but can defend. Richarlison compensates for Neymar’s infiltrations, coming from behind. Raphinha marks outstandingly. Vini [Vinicius] is evolving.”",563
564,Published On 16 Nov 2022,Is VAR the villain of the World Cup?,"Love it or hate it, the video assistant referee is here to stay – so what does it mean for the game?",". .If you’re not already familiar with VAR, or video assistant referee, during the 2022 World Cup you’re about to become very familiar with it. Refereeing with video replay can mean overturning goals, ejecting players, and plenty of moans and cheers. This time, VAR is back with semi-automation to determine if players are offside, with cameras and sensors tracking every limb on the pitch. When it was introduced for the first time at a World Cup in 2018, it changed the tournament – with passionate disagreement about whether that was for better or for worse. So what does VAR have in store for this World Cup? .In this episode:  .Connect with us: .@AJEPodcasts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook .Full episode transcript: .This transcript was created using AI. It’s been reviewed by humans, but it might contain errors. Please let us know if you have any corrections or questions, our email is TheTake@aljazeera.net.  .Halla Mohieddeen: The World Cup starts Sunday with a long list of famous names, from Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo to Neymar. But there’s one more big name off the pitch that you already either know well, or you’re about to become very familiar with. Video assistant referee. V-A-R. Or, simply just VAR. .Newsreel: VAR’s a load of rubbish.  .Newsreel: Wa hakim al VAR. Lagha al hadaf. .Newsreel: Por primera vez en la historia del fútbol, ¡aplauden gracias a Dios al VAR!  .Halla Mohieddeen: When FIFA, the World Cup’s governing body, introduced VAR in 2018, it changed the tournament. Four years on, the debate hasn’t died down – and this year, there will be new technology in the mix. Love it or hate it, VAR is here to stay. So what does that mean for the game? I’m Halla Mohieddeen and this is the Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: I’m talking again with our own Tony Karon, the editorial lead of Al Jazeera’s AJ Plus. And then we’ll take some of those questions around VAR and pose them to an actual World Cup assistant referee in Qatar. .Tony Karon: I’m Tony Karon. I have been immersed in this game for the best part of four plus decades, and I have taught graduate classes at the New School in New York on the politics of global football. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Let’s start off with the basics then. Who or what is VAR? .Tony Karon: Video assistant refereeing is a system that provides backup, shall we say to replay incidents where there’s some controversy. .Newsreel: The referee can delay the restart of play at any time to communicate with the VAR team and will signal this by pointing to his ear.  .Tony Karon: There’s a panel of referees external to the game who review this on the video. .Newsreel: Once the VARs or the referee decide an incident is, in fact, reviewable, the referee would initiate an official review by signalling the outline of a TV screen. .Tony Karon: The referee’s invited to you know, go and look at a pitchside monitor and potentially change a decision. .Halla Mohieddeen: Let’s talk about the reception from supporters. Tony, you’re a fan yourself. Tell me how you felt about VAR the first season you watched it play out. .Tony Karon: I mean, it’s the most frustrating thing for a fan because, you know, you think about a game of football, it’s 90 minutes of stress and tension. Usually punctuated. If you are lucky by the occasional moment of release in that your team scores or comes very close to scoring, you know, your forward – he gets on the end of that cross, you’re like, how did he even get there? And my gosh, he’s done that with the outside of his heel. It’s extraordinary and you’re just on your feet and you are screaming, you’re roaring. And now in the game, somebody scores and there’s that moment, but it’s kind of cut short because every goal these days is checked by VAR. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: So there’s anything, you know, between 10 seconds and a minute and a half before that goal is awarded. After which there’s a much more muted celebration. I mean, literally, you can have moments where the players are waiting so long for the VAR check that the players find themselves having to do warm-up exercises just to keep their muscles from cramping up. In terms of the emotional experience of watching a game and feeling a game, VAR is really just a mood killer. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: In England, where the Premier League has had a famously rocky rollout of VAR, a major survey found more than 90 percent of fans saying it made watching matches less enjoyable. So why introduce it at all? .Tony Karon: Well, how much time have you got? There’s incident after incident, but one of the clearest cases came in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup. It was a qualifying match between Ireland and France, during the heyday of French striker Thierry Henry. .Newsreel: The game had been going well for Ireland. Robbie Keane levelling the World Cup qualifying tie to send the match into extra time. Game on! .Halla Mohieddeen: Then, in the 103rd minute, Henry scored for France. .Newsreel: It’s in the net. It’s a goal.  .Halla Mohieddeen: But on camera, you can clearly see Henry’s hand cupping the bottom of the ball. .Newsreel: Oh dear. Oh dear. That’s a handball twice by Thierry Henry. Look at that. .Newsreel: The Irish players are appealing for a handball here. .Newsreel: The goal counts.  .Newsreel: The referees made his decision. He’s given the goal.  .Halla Mohieddeen: It was clear as day on TV, but on the pitch, the referees missed it. The goal stood, Ireland missed the World Cup, and the clamour for VAR got even louder. For the 2018 World Cup, to FIFA, the technology was a no-brainer. This is FIFA President Gianni Infantino. .Gianni Infantino: Without the VAR, a referee commits an important mistake, a huge mistake every three matches. With the VAR, the referee commits an important mistake every 19 matches. Those are facts. .Halla Mohieddeen: Tony says the need comes from the pace of the modern game. .Tony Karon: The speed at which the game is played right now is incredible, you know, to the human eye, the speed at which things happen. Balls won in the tackle, tackles fouls for the human eye to record all of that and assess it. And that’s really the key point, assessing it is quite an ask. So you can see many reasons why, you know, a history of bad calls has prompted the idea of you can provide a perfect set of visual facts to a referee by using technology. And the idea that it will make the game more fair. It will reduce the dissatisfaction of fans and any suspicion of, sort of, foul play. That’s the theory. There are some interesting things to say about how that’s worked in practice. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Just for starters, how to use VAR is up to the match referee. VAR is a tool that’s available, but the referee makes the final call on whether or not to go with it, and how long to spend looking at the monitor. The referee might not go to the monitor when it is needed, or occasionally, he might be influenced by VAR to change his decision when he was actually right in the first place. That inconsistency is what led to accusations in 2018 from fans that VAR decisions were favouring the big teams in Europe and Latin America. Morocco, Iran, Nigeria, Serbia – all felt strongly that there were huge moments that ended up hurting them. Aside from questions of bias, there’s also just the nature of trying to pinpoint on video a game that’s happening at high speed. Sometimes there isn’t a single snapshot that clarifies everything. .Tony Karon: What’s happening is, and I mean this is, you know, this is not even a controversial thing to say, is that many decisions that are made using VAR technology turn out to have been wrong. In other words, the refs sitting in the VAR booth have made the wrong call. .Halla Mohieddeen: There seems to be lots of examples, Tony, which begs the question from my part. You know, crickets used it for years. Rugby’s used it for years without the level of controversy there is in football. It just seems to be that the only sport that has a real problem with VAR seems to be football. .Tony Karon: Yes and no. What VAR does is provides a perfect set of visual facts which have to be interpreted by a referee. And the referee then has to weigh the meaning of this fact, that fact, and then the fact that followed to weigh the importance to the outcome of each of those facts, to relate them to a set of multiple different rules. It’s like, you know, Richarlison’s hand was on Conarte’s shoulder. Well, how significant was that hand on the shoulder? The visual evidence is there, but the ref is gonna have to make a decision about how did that affect the outcome. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: So, the idea that you provide a perfect set of visual facts that’s going to ensure perfect refereeing is just a fallacy. In fact, if anything, what that’s going to highlight are gonna be the flaws because the audience, the crowd, the TV viewer is going to see exactly what the referee saw and going he saw that and he still, you know, didn’t give a foul. Like, that’s insane. That’s literally where we are right now. .Halla Mohieddeen: So the problem’s not VAR. The problem is referees. .Tony Karon: Yeah. The problem is human refereeing. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: That’s one reason why this World Cup will be the first for another new technology: semi-automation. It’s going to be used to determine offside. A quick recap of the offside rule: Without offside, a player could just stand next to the opponent’s goal the whole game if he wanted, just waiting for a lucky pass from the other end of the pitch. Offside is the reason teams have to actually move the ball down the field, player to player, box to box. .Newsreel: According to FIFA, a player is in an offside position if he is nearer to his opponent’s goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent. .Halla Mohieddeen: That means the referee needs to judge the ball, the player, and the opponents – all at the same time. .Tony Karon: Flagging something for offside literally requires the human eye to be pointed in two opposite directions at once. The place where the ball is being kicked and to the line of players who might be running onto that ball. .Halla Mohieddeen: The easiest way to judge it? Slap a line down the screen, and run it in slow motion, looking for a shoulder or an ankle to stick out. Problem is, picking out one limb from a big group of moving players can take a long time. .Tony Karon: The new system is going to take that out of the hands of the referees. .Newsreel: Twelve dedicated tracking cameras mounted underneath the roof of each stadium, track the ball, and 29 points on the body of each individual player, 50 times per second, calculating their exact position on the pitch. Then, with an offsite decision comes along, image processing algorithms can provide a clear picture of events almost immediately. .Halla Mohieddeen: The call is still up to the officials, but they’ll get, we’re told, a much more accurate picture. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: Now, what that will do is speed it up immensely, right? So, you know, I’ve seen it, when you see it rendered on screen. It’s kind of like these weird bubble figures. It’s not, at least on the video screen, you see the player, whatever, not some sort of robotic bubble representation of the player. But, you know, put that aside. So then if any part of the body is across the line, that AI will immediately flag it. So that will happen a lot quicker than referees being forced to, you know, scrutinise a screen and make a call. .Halla Mohieddeen: Now, Tony, you’ve just finished telling us that no matter how much technology you have, the answer still comes down to humans at the end of the day. So is the answer removing humans from the equation? Is more tech the answer? .Tony Karon: Not necessarily. It can be absolutely, you know, to the letter. But it sort of starts to violate the spirit, still, you know, on balance. You can say, OK, offside, you can automate and it will produce some absurd calls, but it will be quicker. You’ll know the outcome much quicker. .Halla Mohieddeen: After the break, we call up a referee ourselves to get his side of the story. That’s in a moment. .Abdulla al-Marri: My name is Abdulla al-Marri. I’m a Qatari referee. I’m from Qatar. I love sport and that’s why I’m here tonight. .Halla Mohieddeen: Abdulla’s only 29, but he’s already refereed at the Tokyo Olympics and the Asian Football Confederation Cup. So when I asked Abdulla if he’s ready for the pressure of a World Cup. He said it’s all part of the game. .Halla Mohieddeen: Let me give you an example of how controversial this can get. In the 2018 World Cup, Serbia’s coach once suggested that a referee should be sent to a war crimes tribunal when his team didn’t get a penalty after an apparent foul. Now, that didn’t go to VAR. Do you think you’re ready for that kind of pressure when it comes to this World Cup? .Abdulla al-Marri: This is normal. This kind of I would say opinions, sometimes attacks. It’s normal in football because everybody wants to win. It’s the World Cup. .Halla Mohieddeen: Talk to me about your role in a match. When we watch football on television, I can see what the match referee does. He’s there in the black shorts and black shirts, runs around the pitch, blowing his whistle and giving people yellow cards. When do you get involved in making a call? Just talk me through what a day on the job looks like for you. .Abdulla al-Marri: First of all, let me appreciate your definition of the referee who’s running on the field of play showing cards. It’s more than that, but thank you for this simple definition. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Abdulla al-Marri: As a VAR, the main role is to rectify clear and obvious mistakes in match-changing situations. .Halla Mohieddeen: Abdulla says there are four scenarios where that comes into play, everything from whether a goal should be counted to identifying which player should receive one of those yellow cards. .Abdulla al-Marri: Goals, and offences leading up to a goal. Penalty kick decisions and offences leading up to a penalty kick. The direct red-card incidents and mistaken identity incidents. .Halla Mohieddeen: Talk to me about the transition from being a regular referee into a VAR. What made you choose that route? .Abdulla al-Marri: Well, I would say you have to have some skills that can help you to analyse the incidents in a few seconds and to have the conclusion in a few seconds, and to offer the support to the referees in a few seconds, which is not easy. It’s a big improvement in my career to become a VAR, to understand the game more and more to officiate one day on the field of play and the other day in the operation room. So it’s a great experience. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: What kind of questions do people ask you when you tell them you’re a referee? .Abdulla al-Marri: Well, they know all of us, honestly. If they are really following the league, they know us and they start asking why this is not a penalty? Why this is an offside and why blah, blah, blah. So, yeah, it’s not easy because they want you on their side. .Halla Mohieddeen: What kinda calls do you find the hardest to make? .Abdulla al-Marri: Well, the most difficult calls would be handballs and offsides. So those are the most difficult, I would say, incident that might anyone face not even the referees because still, it’s a discussion topic for the spectators as well. .Halla Mohieddeen: And who do you think’s gonna win? What’s your prediction? Who’s gonna win the World Cup? .Abdulla al-Marri: Referees. .Halla Mohieddeen: [Laughing]. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: The referee in football has always been a figure that fans love to hate. When your team loses, a bad call can help soften the blow. So I asked Tony, how does VAR change that? .Tony Karon: When this conversation about VAR and the decision to use it in 2018 was nearing, my friend, the writer Teju Cole wrote that this is going to destroy a key element of the game. And that is that basically when a side loses. The fans can always take solace in the idea that they were robbed by bad calls, by referees making bad calls. And that the elimination of this would leave the naked truth that you lost because you weren’t good enough, and that that’s harder and harsher. He was making a half tongue-in-cheek plea for, you know, keeping that ambiguity and ambivalence. But guess what? Hating the referees on the field has not just been transferred to hating the referees on the field, as well as those and, particularly even perhaps more so, to those who are getting an even more refined slow-motion replay version of the event and still getting it wrong. .Halla Mohieddeen: Perhaps we’ll see the semi-automated refereeing as the moment that began to change. How can you say you were robbed by robotic sensors? But for now, at least, Abdulla, the referee, says the officials on the field try to do the best with what they see. .Abdulla al-Marri: We are judging and analysing the natural movements of the players. We cannot go inside the souls of the players. We cannot say if the players did this with a purpose or not, but we can analyse his actions and movements. I won’t say everybody honestly, but most people will appreciate the correct decision at the end of day. Just I would say be patient and don’t forget that referees are not against anybody. They are forcing the laws of the game. And trying to achieve success at the end. .Halla Mohieddeen: Referees are people, too. Is that a message that you want the fans to take away with them? .Abdulla al-Marri: Well, they are. They are humans. They’re not robots. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s The Take.

Only Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy have made more appearances at a World Cup than Mexico. .El Tri’s road to Qatar has been nothing short of bumpy, with hard-fought draws and narrow wins. The team, CONCACAF’s most successful, finished second in the eight-team qualifiers behind Canada on goal-difference. .They were unable to beat Canada and the United States, who finished third behind the El Tri, in both home and away matches. .Ranked ninth in the world, Mexico have never gone past the quarterfinals. In the last seven editions, Mexico were sent home at the first knockout hurdle. .For Mexico’s colourful and boisterous travelling supporters, reaching the quinto partido (fifth game) at the World Cup has become an obsession. But it will be no easy task to improve on their recent World Cup history as they are in Group C alongside favourites Argentina. .They will also take on Poland, whose attack is spearheaded by Robert Lewandowski, the winner of the Gerd Muller trophy this year for best striker. Lewandowski was crowned FIFA’s men’s player of the year in 2020 after scoring 41 league goals for Bayern Munich – a record for a Bundesliga season. El Tri will also lock horns with Saudi Arabia. .Mexico’s manager, the Argentine Gerardo “Tata” Martino, is expected to pick a mixed squad of experienced veterans and young players. Goalkeeper, 37-year-old Guillermo “Memo” Ochoa, is hoping to participate in his fifth, and most likely his final, World Cup. .Former Manchester United striker Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez, 34, is hoping to board the plane but the country’s all-time top scorer has not had the easiest of relationships with Martino, a former Barcelona manager who also played for Argentina’s national team. .Martino has left Chicharito out of previous squads. In September, he said he will not take the diminutive forward to Qatar despite Chicharito having an impressive season in the MLS with his team LA Galaxy. If he makes it to Qatar, it will be his fourth World Cup.",566
567,Published On 16 Nov 2022,How does FIFA make money from football?,"The winners of the Qatar World Cup will receive $44m out of a total prize pot of $440m, paid by FIFA.",".Business is rarely this simple. If you manufacture a product which everybody wants to buy, but which costs you almost nothing to make, you are going to accrue a lot of money rather quickly. .In a nutshell, this is how FIFA, football’s world governing body, makes money. .In 2018, when the World Cup was hosted in Russia, FIFA made more than $4.6bn in revenue. .FIFA pays World Cup host countries’ organising committees, prize money, travel and accommodation for teams and support staff, plus a legacy fund to help develop the sport in the host country after the World Cup circus has left town. .The winners of the Qatar World Cup will receive $44m out of a total prize pot of $440m, paid by FIFA. .FIFA organises its accounts in four-year cycles around each World Cup. For the most recently published 2015-18 cycle, FIFA brought in $6.4bn. In 2021, a single non-World Cup year, FIFA took in $766m. .  .Most of FIFA’s income comes from selling TV broadcast rights for the World Cup and other international tournaments. .Of the $6.4bn generated in the last cycle, $4.6bn came from TV rights. .Global brands pay FIFA for the right to advertise at the organisation’s events. The biggest brands get to partner with FIFA on its development and social responsibility plans, meaning they have a foot in the door with FIFA’s non-profit side, investing in the sport of football at international, national and grassroots levels. .The next biggest brands are permitted to advertise at the World Cup which is the single most-watched televised event on the planet. About five billion people, more than half the Earth’s population, are expected to tune into this year’s tournament. That’s a big audience for selling things to. .In the pre-2018 World Cup cycle, marketing rights deals landed FIFA $1.66bn. And even in 2021, revenue from the sale of marketing rights amounted to a heathy $131m. .Another money-spinner for FIFA is gate revenue. The entire income from ticketing rights goes to a subsidiary company wholly owned by FIFA. In the 2015-18 cycle, this brought in $712m. .In 2021, ticket sales for the Arab Cup, when about 600,000 people attended, generated an estimated $12m. About three million tickets have been sold for Qatar 2022. And with prices ranging from $100-$1,100, it is sure to be another bumper year. .FIFA also draws in cash through the licensing of its brand. The best known of these is Electronic Arts’ series of FIFA football games, which reportedly generated sales of $20bn for EA over its 20-year partnership with FIFA. .The games manufacturer is understood to have paid FIFA in the region of $150m annually for the right to use the FIFA name. .In 2021, FIFA made $180m from licensing its brand for merchandise, retail and gaming. The same year, FIFA received a $201m award from the US Department of Justice as compensation for losses due to corruption after dozens of top FIFA executives were indicted in 2015.",567
568,Published On 16 Nov 2022,‘Moment of pride’ for Qatar as World Cup 2022 fever takes over,Football fans descend on the capital Doha packing tourist spots and festivals as Qatar World Cup 2022 starts on Sunday.,".Doha, Qatar – For the past few weeks, a foretaste of what Qatar will look like during the World Cup – set to kick off on Sunday- have been playing out on its streets. .Restaurants are becoming packed and queues at checkouts in supermarkets are getting longer, thanks to football fans who have started to arrive. .World Cup branding has engulfed everything from office buildings to lamp posts and walls. .At the newly opened Lusail Boulevard, children in football jerseys run around while football enthusiasts strolled under a giant canopy of flags of competing nations, making it a field day for Instagram influencers and photographers alike. .One of the key attractions at the boulevard is a giant installation of the World Cup mascot La’eeb pouring out a cup of Arabic coffee. .Families queue up, waiting patiently for their turn to pose for photographs next to the smiling La’eeb. .Celebrations have also kicked off at the popular Corniche area. Families and individuals are walking up and down the coastal promenade – listening to DJs play techno music and enjoying light shows. .The waterfront site will be an important tourist hotspot where daily leisure events will take place throughout the World Cup. .At the country’s top attraction Souq Waqif, shops and restaurants are crammed with people late into the evening. One coffeeshop worker, Athar, says people have queued up outside their small establishment until midnight in the past few days. .“We barely have a chance to take a break. We are serving non-stop,” he says. .Police patrols around places like Corniche and Souq Waqif have increased, with roadblocks popping up in the past two weeks. .The Corniche has been pedestrianised, with no private vehicles allowed until December 19, the day after the final. .Barricades around metro stations are visible in an obvious attempt to better manage crowd lineups. .The underground network is likely to be the primary mode of transportation for more than a million visitors expected in the country – free for all Hayya Card holders. .Amid more security and transport bottlenecks, congestion on roads has also increased. .Ahmed Nasir, a 30-year-old resident told Al Jazeera it takes him “double the time” to reach his office by car making it more expensive, and has therefore switched to using the metro in recent days. .Construction workers can still be seen working for most hours of the day. Some buildings still look far from being completed. .At some sites, FIFA branding seems to be serving a double purpose – concealing unfinished construction sites, while simultaneously promoting the 29-day-long event. .Ismael Cadus, a teacher at Qatar Foundation, said the World Cup was not just a proud occasion for Qatar, but the entire region. .“Football fans will now get acquainted with Arab culture. This is not a moment of pride just for Qatar, but across the Arab world,” he told Al Jazeera.",568

Fixtures: Iran (November 21), USA (November 25), Wales (November 29) .England’s 1966 World Cup win at Wembley Stadium remains a rallying point of English identity, and fans believe they are owed a major victory after so many years. .Having qualified for Qatar 2022 unbeaten, Gareth Southgate’s Lions are gunning for glory. .They finished fourth at the last World Cup and were runners-up at the delayed Euro 2020, and would likely be disappointed if they didn’t get a decent run in Qatar. .Their recent run of form in the League of Nations – zero wins in six games – means England might need an excellent start against Iran to bolster their confidence. .While several teams are built around a single global superstar, England is without such a golden child. . .Harry Kane, who leads the team by example, scoring 51 goals in his 75 England appearances, is undoubtedly a world-class player. But he is supported by a solid squad, all performing to a high level in the world’s top leagues, giving the team some commanding personalities at all areas on the pitch. .England has a rich history at the World Cup, having failed to qualify on only three occasions since 1950 – West Germany (1974), Argentina (1978), USA (1994). They have failed to clear the group stage just three times in 15 World Cup runs and have bowed out in the quarter-finals nine times. .With six goals at Russia 2018, Kane stands a chance of breaking Gary Lineker’s record of 10 to become England’s highest World Cup goalscorer. But do watch out for youngsters Jude Bellingham in midfield and Bukayo Saka in attack. .England is expected to sail through their group, which according to FIFA world rankings, is one of the most competitive. Wales, the USA and Iran may all give the Three Lions a run for their money, but England should qualify comfortably. .England has come a long way since 1950 when their first World Cup saw the tournament favourites beaten 1-0 by a USA team featuring a postman and a funeral director. .Could this be the year they finally “bring football home”? Whatever happens, just don’t let it go to penalties.",569
570,Published On 16 Nov 2022,The 10 players to watch out for at World Cup 2022,"France’s Mbappe is our No 1 pick, followed by Argentina’s Messi. Portugal’s Ronaldo makes the cut at No 5.",".All 32 teams have named their squads for Qatar 2022. .Every team will have 26 players in their ranks to choose from but here are the top 10 players you should keep an eye on: .The captain of the Three Lions has averaged a goal per World Cup game. The Tottenham talisman needs only two goals in an England shirt to equal Wayne Rooney’s 53 goals as England’s all-time top scorer. .Kane is a solid all-round player, comfortable working as a solo striker or in central midfield. Referees will be watching out, however, for his tendency to back into defenders jumping for a ball in the box, which often sends the defender to the floor. .A veteran of the game who shows no sign of retiring, Lewandowski scored 18 times in his first 19 games for Barcelona. Let’s be clear: No one’s expecting big things from Poland at this World Cup. But if something major does happen, then you can be sure that 34-year-old Lewandowski will be at the centre of it. .He has been the top scorer in Germany’s Bundesliga for seven seasons. He scored 41 goals in the 2020-21 season alone. Lewandowski is a 6’1″ goal-scoring machine, and possibly one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time. He is a mature player in all senses, prioritising hard work and discipline in his pursuit of greatness. .  .This Belgium team is not without its superstars. Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard seem to score goals for fun. But Batshuayi scores when it’s needed the most – netting 26 times for Belgium. He has speed and strength and will link up superbly with teammates to create opportunities out of thin air. .It might be tough to stand out in this team, who surely have to be one of the favourites to raise the trophy. .The 29-year-old Liverpool midfielder is unlikely to see his name on the score sheet at this World Cup. He has yet to score for Brazil in 28 appearances and head coach Tite has named a squad featuring nine attackers, so he may not get much of a look-in when it comes to penalty box action. .But his robust style makes him one of the best defensive midfielders in the sport. He can drop down to a centre-back when needed, and has such great vision of game play that he is well-regarded for winning possession and recycling balls, turning threats into new attacks. .Gareth Bale may not be holding the hopes of a nation returning to the World Cup for the first time in 64 years on just his shoulders alone, but it probably feels like it. Wales do have some decent players in their squad, but Bale is a global superstar. When he’s on form, he’s devastating. But personality clashes and a lack of game time at Real Madrid saw him transfer to Los Angeles, where he probably isn’t facing the same calibre of opposition as during his spells in the Premier League and La Liga. .Portugal’s all-time top goal scorer may be slowing down a bit at 37. But he’s still a remarkable force in front of the goal. Often given a good deal of freedom to roam out of traditional positions, Ronaldo is a creative playmaker, a showman who knows and loves that the world is watching him. .Ronaldo has scored 117 times for Portugal. If he can leave his issues with his Manchester United club behind him when he gets on the plane to Qatar, we’ll be seeing him score a few more for sure. .Accuracy, speed, dribbling, technical wonderment and stellar free-kicks make Hakim Ziyech one of the most dangerous players at this tournament. If Morocco do make it out of Group F, where they have been drawn with Belgium, Canada and Croatia, it will be largely down to the Chelsea winger, who was nicknamed “The Wizard” while at Ajax. .Watch out for moves starting way out wide on the right, playing pinpoint passes to teammates on diagonal runs. But he’s not just about the assists. His speed means he can lose opponents and create his own chances, with 17 goals for Morocco under his belt. .What is there to be said about Neymar that hasn’t already been said? He’s scored 75 goals for Brazil. He can play as a striker, or on the wing, or in midfield. He’s got speed, he’s got all the skills and tricks and flicks you could hope for. He’s a champagne footballer who is a delight to watch. He will run rings around defenders and can score with either foot – or his head. You might even see a rainbow flick if he really wants to humiliate an opponent. .But Neymar’s got a big target on his back. Expect to see plenty of physical challenges against him, as well as him making the most of each one, diving and rolling around on the pitch in dramatic fashion. .Messi is almost certainly the finest footballer of his generation. Possibly of any generation. He’s been called the “PlayStation footballer” because of his unreal skill of appearing like he’s hard-coded by a computer programmer. He’s won seven Ballon d’Or awards. He’s broken every record in Europe. .But he hasn’t yet won a World Cup. And, at 35, he probably won’t have another chance. .Who among the next generation could fill Messi’s shoes? At Paris Saint-Germain, you only have to look over Messi’s shoulder to see one candidate: Mbappe. .The 23-year-old already has 28 goals for France. Another forward who can play on either wing because of his both-footedness, Mbappe’s versatility sees him provide chances and assists for his teammates, especially coming from the right. .He’s creative, with explosive acceleration and a sudden change of pace and direction that leaves opponents bewildered. A prodigious talent, Mbappe has the potential to be among the best the world has ever seen. This World Cup is a huge stage for him to get closer to that goal.",570
571,Published On 16 Nov 2022,China’s businesses get top billing at World Cup after team flops,"Chinese brands, including Wanda Group and Vivo, are the biggest-spending sponsors at the 2022 tournament.",".Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia – China may not be sending a side to Qatar, but Chinese businesses will have top billing as sponsors at the 2022 World Cup. .Chinese brands are the biggest sponsors of the tournament — even outspending the slate of American companies that includes iconic names such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Budweiser. .China’s sponsors have ponied up $1.395bn for the competition, which runs November 20-December 18, surpassing the $1.1bn spent by US companies, according to GlobalData, a London-based data analytics and consulting company. .Broken down on an annual basis, Chinese sponsorship is valued at $207m per year, compared with Qatari and US deals worth $134m and $129m, respectively, according to the data. .China’s corporate dominance at the competition reflects the aspirations of its brands to expand their recognition overseas to a level that matches their growing size and reach. .The rise of Chinese sponsors also parallels President Xi Jinping’s dream of turning China, which made its sole World Cup appearance in 2002, into a football powerhouse through ambitious plans and targets, such as increasing the number of schools with football pitches 10-fold by 2025. .While the four Chinese sponsors of the 2022 tournament — Wanda Group, Vivo, Mengniu Dairy and Hisense — have relatively low profiles outside their home country, they are huge enterprises with multibillion-dollar revenues and thousands of employees. .Wanda Group, an industry-spanning conglomerate founded in 1988, and Mengniu, one of China’s largest dairy producers, have each made the Fortune 500 list several times. . .“The World Cup works for Chinese companies both outside but also inside China as soccer has a large following with Chinese audiences,” Martin Roll, a branding expert and consultant based in Singapore, told Al Jazeera. .“It signals strongly that these Chinese brands are playing at global scale, and showcasing that to Chinese audiences play an important role. Being a sponsor and a marketing partner of the World Cup is only for a selected few brands that can afford it, so just being part of it, is a testimony to the aspirations of the Chinese brands.” .Chinese companies hope an association with the beautiful game may help them shed negative perceptions about the “made in China” tag, said Paul Temporal, a branding expert at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School. .“Sports sponsorships allow Chinese brands to connect with global audiences that share universal love of sports experiences in emotional settings. Football crosses all cultural boundaries and provides massive global reach,” Temporal told Al Jazeera. .“Chinese brands have learned from western counterparts that, although expensive to gain access to the world’s best events, sports sponsorships do deliver long-term results both for the brand owners and the nation. Brands that go global are brand ambassadors for China and if successful in terms of global market share, can have a positive effect on national brand image.” . .The biggest Chinese sponsor in Qatar by far is Wanda Group, one of the seven official FIFA Partners — the highest sponsorship tier — alongside Coca-Cola, Adidas, Hyundai, Kia, Qatar Airways, QatarEnergy, and Visa. .The Beijing-based conglomerate, which has investments in real estate, entertainment, media, manufacturing and financial services, has committed $850m as part of a 15-year deal that covers all World Cup events up until 2030, according to GlobalData. .Vivo, a consumer electronics company based in the southern city of Dongguan, is spending an estimated $450m as part of a six-year deal that included the 2017 Confederations Cup and 2018 World Cup. .Mengniu, which has its headquarters in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, and Hisense, an electronics manufacturer based in Qingdao, have committed to spend an an estimated $60m and $35m, respectively. .“Many Chinese companies grew globally by acquiring foreign brands. Lenovo and Haier have followed this approach in addition to their own brand building,” Carlos Torelli, a professor of marketing at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told Al Jazeera, referring to China’s popular personal computer and consumer electronics brands. .“That makes it easier to penetrate global markets with an established brand. However, many other Chinese brands are attempting to build their own brands and events like the World Cup are perfect ones to create awareness among large audiences. Participating in these events can facilitate future market expansions.” .While solar panel manufacturer Yingli Solar became China’s first World Cup sponsor at the 2010 tournament in South Africa, Chinese companies began to make their presence known in a big way at the 2018 competition in Russia. .After leading brands, including Sony, Emirates and Johnson & Johnson, dropped FIFA in 2014 and 2015 amid allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the Russia and Qatar tournaments, Chinese companies filled the funding gap. .Shortly after Wanda Group signed its mega-sponsorship deal in 2016, company founder Wang Jianlin said the controversies had been an “opportunity” for Chinese firms that previously may have never had the chance to support the tournament “even if we wanted to”. .No fewer than seven Chinese companies sponsored the 2018 competition, spending an estimated $835m — far more than US and Russian brands. .Chinese firms maintained their strong showing at the 2021 Copa América, South America’s biggest football tournament, making up three of the four official sponsors. .Kuaishou, TCL Technology and Sinovac found themselves shouldering the bulk of the sponsorship duties after several big sponsors, including Mastercard and Diageo, pulled out amid controversy over the health risks posed to players by COVID-19. .Ahead of Qatar 2022, Chinese brands have again shown themselves to be more hesitant to wade into debates about human rights than their corporate counterparts elsewhere. .Unlike Budweiser, Adidas, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s, Chinese sponsors have not expressed support for a Human Rights Watch campaign that calls on FIFA and Qatar to compensate migrant workers and their families for deaths and injuries that occurred during the World Cup preparations. .Qatar’s government has said it has made “substantial progress” on labour reforms and it continues to work with nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) to “ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective”. Qatari officials have also denied allegations of corruption in their World Cup bid. .“Many global brands are careful of not getting into a political debate about their support, so they may have been more hesitant to join as sponsors,” Roll said. .Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing and sponsorship agency NC Partnership, said, however, that major sponsors from across the globe were ultimately choosing to stick with the tournament due to the huge business opportunities involved. .“There is controversy surrounding the staging of the World Cup in Qatar. However, would Coca-Cola pull out and risk Pepsi stepping in?” Currie told Al Jazeera. .“Would Visa surrender their position and allow Mastercard back? The motor vehicle category is hugely competitive and any number of global car companies would be keen to take over from Hyundai Kia. The same argument can be made for several other product categories. The simple fact is that World Cup deals are done over several World Cups and are designed to exclude competitors and provide major brands with an exclusive and elite opportunity to reach billions of people around the world.” .Josh Gardner, the CEO and co-founder of China-focused consultancy Kung Fu Data, said he expected Chinese brands to keep rising in international prominence as they “seek ways to build a stronghold beyond the homeland”. .“This is not unlike a parallel trend of Chinese brands inking sponsorship agreements with Hollywood,” Gardner told Al Jazeera, pointing to product placements involving Vivo, instant messenger Tencent QQ and e-commerce company Jingdong. .“Recall the many Marvel and DC movies featuring labels such as Vivo and QQ and plastering the Jingdong logo across fictional skyscrapers on the big screen.”",571
572,Published On 15 Nov 2022,Doha exhibition traces Qatar’s football journey,"The exhibition, which opened its doors days before the start of the World Cup in Qatar, aims to tell the ‘untold’ story of how the game developed in the Gulf country.",".Doha, Qatar – An exhibition charting the history of football in Qatar has opened its doors in Doha, as the Middle Eastern country readies to welcome fans for the World Cup, due to start on Sunday. .“The World Cup is coming to Qatar in a few days and we wanted to celebrate the occasion by holding this exhibition,” said Aysha al-Ansari, head of the Heritage Collection at the imposing Qatar National Library, where the showcase is being held. .“We want to increase the awareness of the public and the visitors coming to our country from around the world when it comes to our football heritage,” she told Al Jazeera. “For certain fans of the game, it is still an untold story.” .At the exhibition, titled “Goaaal! How Football Kicked off in Qatar”, visitors can walk past large billboards documenting the history of the sport in Qatar, including information about its stadiums, leagues and teams. .They can also see handmade football jerseys that the Maroons – Qatar’s national team – used to wear, alongside decades-old footballs, retro boots and other memorabilia. And they can watch and listen to recordings in which pioneering figures narrate how the love for football evolved in the country. .People in the small, gas-rich nation first began playing football in the late 1940s, according to the exhibition’s organisers. But it was not until 1970 that the country’s national team played their first ever international match, a 2-1 loss to neighbouring Bahrain. .The Maroons have come a long way since then. .They have made 10 appearances at the Asian Cup, which they won in a major upset in 2019 by beating four-time winners Japan in the final. Shortly afterwards, left-winger Akram Afif, the star of the current Qatar national team, was crowned the Asian footballer of the year. .Qatar has also won the regional Arabian Gulf Cup on three occasions – 1992, 2004 and 2014. In 2015, the Maroons recorded their biggest-ever win, smashing Bhutan 15-0. .The exhibition honours past legends of the game in Qatar, including Khalfan Ibrahim Khalfan, a former winger for the national team and a Qatar 2022 legacy ambassador. .“I’m very proud that we are hosting the World Cup. It makes me, Qatar and all Arabs extremely proud,” Khalfan told Al Jazeera. .More than one million visitors are expected to visit the country during the tournament that will end on December 18. .“We will show, through a successful tournament, that there is more to our region than the negative things that some people see in the media. There is more to this region than conflicts. This World Cup will look very different than the other World Cups. Our unique culture and hospitality will be on display,” Khalfan said. .This will be the first time that the football showpiece will be hosted in the Middle East, and the first time Qatar will take part. .The hosts will face Ecuador in the tournament’s opening match on Sunday, before squaring against Senegal and the Netherlands. .At the exhibition, which will be open throughout the World Cup and beyond, guests and dignitaries were optimistic about the Maroons’ chances. .“Qatar will go far in the competition, God willing,” Khalfan said, a hint of a smile forming on his face.",572
573,Published On 15 Nov 2022,Qatari minister slams Western media coverage of World Cup record,Ali bin Samikh al-Marri says his country accepts constructive criticism but he decries use of ‘statistics [that] lack accuracy’.,".Qatar’s labour minister has hit out at Western media for their coverage of the country’s preparations for the football World Cup, days before the Gulf state becomes the first in the Middle East to host the event. .Speaking at a meeting hosted by the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights on Monday, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri said that while Qatar accepts constructive criticism, the campaign against his country had recently picked up pace. .Al-Marri in Brussels criticised the coverage of migrant worker deaths in preparation for the World Cup – with alleged figures ranging between 6,500 to 15,000 – as “circulated statistics [that] lack accuracy, credibility and integrity, and are not issued by documented bodies”. .“Every day, we hear a new slander about mortality rates of workers, as if we were in a ‘public auction’,” he said. .“I would like to stress the inaccuracy of these numbers. I would also implore all politicians to refer to official specialised organisations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) … when sourcing accurate information,” he said. . .In February 2021, the Guardian newspaper reported that 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in the country since 2010, when Qatar was awarded the World Cup. .The Qatari government has stated that these figures, provided by the respective countries’ embassies, included deaths of people not working on World Cup projects. It said, “The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population.” .The government said there were 37 deaths between 2014 and 2020 among workers directly linked to the construction of World Cup stadiums, of which three were “work-related”. .Last month, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said his country faced an “unprecedented campaign” of criticism in the lead-up to the event, which raised questions “about the real reasons and motives” behind the campaign. Senior Qatari officials have also denounced the “hypocrisy” of people calling for a boycott of the World Cup to protest against alleged human rights in the Gulf country. .French publication Le Canard enchainé recently sparked outrage after publishing a cartoon depicting Qatari footballers as terrorists. The caricature was blasted by social media users as “blatant Islamophobia” and “racism”. .On Monday, al-Marri said: “The slanders and allegations against Qatar began to take a different turn in adopting hate and racist rhetoric with the aim of offending the Qatari people and their national team.” .He added: “We will not accept hate speech and systematic racism towards our people, our country and our team, and we call on international human rights organisations to take firm stances against anyone who engages in this attack.” . .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been in the spotlight since it was awarded the tournament, leading to calls for teams to boycott the tournament altogether. .The country faced widespread criticism from human rights groups for its previous use of the kafala system – under which workers are tied to an employer whose consent they need to change jobs in the form of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) – a law that rights activists have argued tied their presence in Qatar to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .The need for a NOC to change employment was scrapped in August 2020 amid other landmark changes, including the introduction of a minimum wage. Qatar also introduced a minimum wage and new regulations on working in heat, as part of a labour reform process that it said was launched before it was awarded the World Cup. .In his speech on Monday, al-Marri said critics of Qatar were purposely ignoring the country’s labour reforms because “they do not serve their misleading stories”. .The ILO, in a report released this month, said Qatar had made progress in its labour reforms but challenges in their implementation remained. It said the changes have improved the working and living conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers – estimated to form 85 percent of Qatar’s population – though additional efforts were needed to ensure that all workers could benefit. .The World Cup kicks off on November 20, with the opening match seeing the hosts take Ecuador in Al Bayt Stadium. The final will take place on December 18. .",573

Fixtures: Costa Rica (November 25), Germany (November 27), Japan (December 1) .A proven winner as manager, a squad replete with young stars and a World Cup-winning captain – Spain may not be the outright favourites in Qatar, but they are likely to be difficult to beat. .Spanish fans will expect their side to progress with relative ease out of a group containing Costa Rica and Japan, but a stern test awaits in the shape of four-time champions Germany, with whom Luis Enrique’s team will probably battle for the top spot. .Tournament regulars Spain have competed at every World Cup since 1978. Only five teams boast better overall appearance records – Brazil, Germany, Argentina, Italy and Mexico – with Qatar 2022 marking the Spaniards’ 16th involvement since the inaugural competition took place in Uruguay in 1930. .In 2010, Spain stunned the tournament in South Africa with their possession-dominating Tiki-Taka football, topping their qualifying group before sweeping aside all challengers in the knockout phase to claim a historic first World Cup win. They had never previously made it past the quarter-finals. .An initially shaky start saw the Spaniards suffer a shock 1-0 opening round loss to Switzerland, but victories against Honduras and Chile steadied the campaign and saw them set up a round of 16 clash against neighbouring Portugal. .From there, the team proved unstoppable, beating Portugal, Paraguay, Germany and eventually the Netherlands in a tension-filled final decided by an extra-time winner – a run of games that saw them contest more than 360 minutes of elimination football without conceding a single goal. .The win crowned a golden period for Spain, who also claimed two European Championship trophies in 2008 and 2012. .Despite it being his first World Cup campaign, Spanish hopes for glory in Qatar will likely pivot on the performances of Pedro González López, better known as Pedri, who turns 20 in November. .Widely touted in recent years as one of world football’s most promising wonderkids, the diminutive central midfielder has already affirmed his talent on the international stage and attracted major acclaim for his creative abilities. .He was awarded the prestigious Golden Boy trophy – handed to the standout player aged 21 or under in Europe – at the end of last year following a string of eye-catching performances for Spain at Euro 2020 and a breakthrough season at club side Barcelona which saw him win a regular place in the Spanish behemoth’s starting XI. .Pedri’s Barcelona boss, the legendary ex-Barcelona and Spain midfielder Xavi, has already compared the blossoming talent to fellow Spanish great Andres Iniesta for his positional intelligence and dazzling technical ability. .Spain is anticipated to battle it out with Germany for preeminence in Group E, but should comfortably secure one of the two qualifying spots ahead of Japan and Costa Rica. .Under the guidance of Enrique, a serial winner with Barcelona from 2014-17, and revered captain Sergio Busquets, part of the team that lifted the World Cup in 2010, a run to the final stages of the tournament is a distinct possibility. .Seven wins and two draws in their last 10 games mean Spain will start the World Cup on a confident footing.",575

His post was accompanied by the image of a young woman taking off her headscarf, as many have done during the demonstrations. .The former captain of the Iranian national football team and ex-Bundesliga player was also at odds with authorities last month when he refuted an official claim that a female school student in his hometown of Ardabil had died of pre-existing conditions in a case that officials said was unrelated to the protests despite media reports. .An image of Daei circulated on social media late on Sunday, which appeared to show him in the vicinity of the Dey General Hospital in Tehran, where imprisoned activist Hossein Ronaghi was believed to have been taken after his health deteriorated. Numerous videos online showed protests around the hospital. .Ronaghi was arrested for speaking out against the crackdown on the protests, during which hundreds of people have been arrested and dozens have died. No official casualty figures are available. .The Iranian judiciary subsequently showed an image of Ronaghi in a hospital bed, meeting his mother, and he was later taken back to prison. .The Iranian national team, which finalised its squad late on Sunday, arrived in Qatar on Monday and began training early on Tuesday. .Accompanied by head coach Carlos Queiroz, team members met with President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials in Tehran hours before leaving for the World Cup. .“Some don’t want to see the success and victory of Iranian youth and wish to disturb your focus. Be very vigilant on this,” the president warned them. .Numerous athletes have shown solidarity with the protests. Meanwhile, amid claims that Tehran has armed Russia for the war in Ukraine, activists abroad and in Ukraine have separately called for the exclusion of Team Melli, Iran’s national football team, from the tournament.",576
577,Published On 15 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: All the groups ranked,Does your team have an easy ride or are they facing this year’s group of death?,".Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments. .With five billion people expected to tune in to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the pressure to get it right is on. .The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. .Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. .Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted. . .FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. .No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. .At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed. Group E, with Spain and Germany, looks sewn up from the start, as does Group F, with Belgium and Croatia. But anything could happen in the other groups. .Ordering the groups at Qatar 2022 according to their average FIFA world rankings reveals each one’s overall strength. .We can also determine the spread of rankings within a group to judge which is the most competitive. .Let’s take a look: .With an average world ranking of 30, and a spread of 48 ranking places between strongest and weakest, Group A seems the weakest. The Netherlands (8th), should sail through. Senegal (18th) should see off Ecuador (44th). Qatar (50th) have a home advantage – and when players have experience playing in the Middle East’s conditions, this could count for a lot. .  .Weighing in with an average world ranking of 28 and a spread of 52 rankings, Group H is the second weakest. Portugal (9th), Uruguay (14th) and South Korea (28th) will be pushing hard for the knockout spots. Ghana (61) will be lucky to progress. .The group has an average world ranking of 23.25 and a spread of 48 places. Argentina (9th) will be among the tournament favourites but to get there, they’ll need to see off Mexico (13th), as well as Poland (26th) and Saudi Arabia (51st). .The next toughest pool has an average world ranking of 20.5 and a spread of 34 positions. France (4th) and Denmark (10th) will likely see off Tunisia (30th) and Australia (38th) but the European teams will need to ensure their consistency through the early stages of the tournament. .This group has an average world ranking of 20 and a spread of 42 ranking positions. Brazil (1st) are legends of the game and the most successful national team in the history of the World Cup with five titles. Switzerland (15th), Serbia (21st) and Cameroon (43rd) do not ensure this group’s destiny is written yet, with the Serbians’ dogged tenacity and the flair of Cameroon being crucial to their chances. .The Belgians may not spring to mind as one of the world’s top footballing nations, but they are currently ranked second in the world. And in a group with an average world ranking of 19.25 and a spread of 39 places, the Red Devils should face no problem getting through. Croatia (12th) will be in hot pursuit, while Morocco (22nd) and Canada (41st) may struggle to get to the later stages of the competition. .This group has an average world ranking of 18.25 and a spread of 24 ranking places. Spain (7th) and Germany (11th) will likely be favourites to top Group E, but Japan (24th), semi-finalists in 2002, can’t be written off. With Costa Rica (31st), expect a strong challenge from all in this group. .The toughest group of all due to the average world ranking of 15 and a spread of just 15 places. It is also the tightest and most competitive. .England (5th) must be considered a serious challenger for the trophy. But there could be fireworks, as England take on their neighbours, Wales (19th), and USA (16th) face off against geopolitical rival Iran (20th). .Yet, mere statistics don’t equal results on the pitch. .Which teams can find it within themselves to become more than the sum of their parts? Who can defy the odds within 90 minutes? This is, after all, why we all watch the beautiful game.",577
578,Published On 15 Nov 2022,"Ahead of World Cup 2022, we visit Diego Maradona’s neighbourhood","We all ‘have some of Maradona in us’, say locals in his former stomping grounds, recalling him as flawed, feisty and a magician with the ball.",".Villa Fiorito, Argentina – There are some stories about Diego Maradona that you cannot believe. .One that you can, starts in a small school with a sunny courtyard that has trees in bloom and involves an orange. Maradona attended primary school in the poor, working-class city of Villa Fiorito on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. .According to neighbourhood lore, he walked home from school, kicking and playing tricks with the orange he got for dessert from school as if it were a football, an object he was already learning to dominate. .“That’s the famous story,” Cristian Bustos, 44, a lifelong Fiorito resident, said outside the school’s gate. .Maradona’s football wizardry as a child astonished coaches. .He moved out of Villa Fiorito and the small white house he shared with his parents and five siblings when he was a teenager. He left for the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of La Paternal, where he played for the Argentina Juniors, before moving to the Boca Juniors in the same city and then catapulting onto the international stage. .But the spirit of the scrappy, controversial and beloved superstar continues to reverberate throughout Fiorito, even two years after his death at the age of 60 from heart failure and pulmonary edema. His image is etched on the community’s weathered skin. .Muralists have painted Maradona on the facades of houses and sports clubs. The images are outside a dirt field used by a local football club and on crumbling walls that locals walk by on their way to and from work. .“I think that all of us in the neighbourhood have some of Maradona in us,” said Bustos, who works in the Fiorito Cultural Centre. “Those of us who were born inside Fiorito, who struggle to make it, we understand what it’s like to fight against power.” .Fiorito has changed since Maradona worked over that orange on its streets. There is electricity, running water and modest beautification projects. A street corner where neighbours used to dump their rubbish is now a grass-covered plaza, and the dirt pitch where Maradona honed his skills is full of houses. .The school where he got his oranges has undergone a makeover, and a mural of a young Maradona graces its inner courtyard. .“It was always important that this was Maradona’s school,” said Laura Fleitas, 46, who has worked at the school since 1998. .“His grandmother and godmother both worked here. His grandmother was a cook. In the neighbourhood, they were very well-known.” .Claudio “Tati” Villarruel, 48, has also heard the stories passed on from his father who co-founded Estrellas Unidas, the Fiorito football club where Maradona first played as a youngster. It was then known as Estrellas Rojas. .In its early days, it was a tiny neighbourhood club that operated from the kitchen tables of residents and later formalised its operations with a clubhouse not far from where Maradona lived. .Recently, Villarruel’s uncle, Osvaldo, reminisced about how a five- or six-year-old Maradona would literally dance around him and the other older boys with a football, much to their chagrin. On some days, they sent him packing, laughed Villarruel, who grew up five blocks from Maradona’s original house and is now secretary general of Estrellas Unidas. .The club organised a barbecue and party on October 30 to mark Maradona’s birthday, drawing musicians, artists, relatives and former teammates to the clubhouse, which is decorated with images of Maradona. .Men of Maradona’s vintage embraced and reminisced about their own glory days on the field and how time flies. Then, they all poured onto the street to inaugurate a new street sign with Maradona’s name. .For many here, it was not just Maradona’s greatness on the field, but his defiance off it that they loved. He attacked US imperialism, the riches of The Vatican and bemoaned the growing impoverishment of Argentines. .“I couldn’t imagine this World Cup without Diego because Diego gave it that quota of enthusiasm and pride,” Villarruel said. .“We still miss him because of all the things he might be saying. He never kept quiet. And despite everything he went through with addiction, that doesn’t change anything for us because he’s not the only one, and like he said: You can’t stain the ball.” .For all the things that have changed in Fiorito, many have stayed the same. The area where Maradona lived has a sewage system now, but an entire other section still does not. Fiorito continues to strain under crushing poverty. .Maradona’s childhood house, which Argentina’s government named a site of historical significance last year, has become a sort of shrine to the star. Fans leave flags and flowers outside although the house is not open to the public and is in disrepair. Maradona’s mother is said to have given the property to a woman she knew, and that woman’s son lives there now. .Bustos laments that more has not been done to preserve the historical significance of the home and other connections that Fiorito has to Maradona, which he believes could be an economic driver for locals. .While residents revel in the pride that comes with living in Maradona’s original stomping grounds, he said they are also used to the photo ops that produce no real change. .“We know because we live it,” Bustos said. “They’ve already lied to us so many times. It speaks to why we fight against the powerful and things like that, which Diego did and which I think a lot of people adopted.” .Bustos’s own focus has been on generating more creative outlets for his community. He has been working with local muralists on projects that add colour to the streets. .During the COVID-19 pandemic, they created an “open sky gallery” of murals on homes that in some cases were dedicated to people who had succumbed to the disease. “Convirtiendo el dolor a colour,” he said in Spanish, which translates into “turning the pain into something that is colourful”. .Although Maradona left Fiorito long ago, the kinship he forged with those who live here remains. .“I loved that he would fight with everyone,” Bustos said. “And that air of superiority – I think all of us from Fiorito have a touch of that too. Everyone wanted a piece of Maradona, not just Fiorito. You feel sorry for how it all ended. Many said that he lived the life he wanted, but I don’t think he was properly taken care of, either.” .Maradona is gone, but the people of Villa Fiorito continue to live with him. Gustavo Horacio Insaurralde, 39, works next to a towering rendition of Maradona sitting on a pitch that is painted on the back of a building in town. .He works five days a week as a cardboard collector, scouring the streets of Buenos Aires for recyclable material that he will then sell. He stores giant sacks with his daily haul in front of the Maradona mural. Each of those bags filled with cardboard represents “the bread I bring home for my family”, he said. .Insaurralde reflected on the joy that Maradona gave people. He had tried to pay his respects to him after his death, joining the masses that lined up for a viewing of his coffin in Argentina’s presidential palace, but skirmishes that broke out between fans and authorities meant that he never made it inside. .“Diego was a magician,” Insaurralde said. “Perhaps as a person he was not as we hoped. There are things that he did that we punish boys for, and you have to teach youngsters that they don’t work. But the reality is that with the ball, he made magic. He lifted the jersey up high.”",578

Golden Boot: Ronaldo (Brazil) .The world’s biggest football tournament moved to the biggest continent for the first time in its history. .When entries for hosting rights were announced, Japan and South Korea had bid separately. .However, they were advised and agreed on making a joint bid which was duly approved. South Korea’s bidding officials tried to include North Korea as another co-host to promote reunification but the idea was not approved. .The number of available slots for the tournament’s main draw was down to 29, as the co-hosts and defending champions France qualified automatically. Among the remaining spots, two were allotted to Asia, which were taken up by Saudi Arabia and China, who qualified for the first time. .Of Africa’s five, Senegal took one as first-time qualifiers. Ecuador and Slovenia were the other debutants. .A few big names from previous tournaments missed out, including Netherlands, Romania, Colombia and Norway. .Defending champions France started as favourites along with Argentina, Brazil, Spain and Italy. Two of these, however, stumbled early on and failed to go past the group stage. .France lost the opening game to Senegal, a former French colony and several of whose squad members played in the French leagues.  France were then held to a goalless draw by Uruguay, before being knocked out with a 2-0 loss to Denmark. .Argentina had slightly better results (one win and one draw) in the so-called Group of Death. England avenged their loss from four years earlier, thanks to a 1-0 win against the Argentines. .Brazil and Spain blazed their way to the knockouts by winning all three group games. Spain’s impressive run came to an end in the quarter-finals where they faced the mighty home force of the South Koreans. .Spurred on by crowd support, the home nation had several controversial decisions go their way.

582,Published On 14 Nov 2022,World Cup: Africa knows Qatar’s pain and joy,"Along with the Arab world, Africa will celebrate, too — no matter the racism and bigotry that the West throws at Qatar.",".I know what it’s like to dream for one’s region at the FIFA World Cup from a distance. I know what it’s like to see those hopes come true in front of one’s eyes. .So I know why the 2022 edition will be special for Qatar — and why millions of others from across Africa and the Middle East will savour it, too. .When it comes to the most memorable football tournaments in history, the 1986 World Cup, played in Mexico, is my sentimental favourite. .Argentina beat Germany 3-2 in the final to lift the 13th edition of the competition, best remembered for the outstanding and inspiring exploits of one player: Diego Maradona. His sublime and flamboyant performances left me utterly speechless and star-struck. Especially when he scored the so-called “goal of the century” in Argentina’s quarter-final match against England. .I was just an 11-year-old boy from Harare, Zimbabwe, and had started to appreciate and follow international football on TV. The pint-sized Argentinean captain seemed superhuman at times, and his skills and sheer strength of character certainly captured the world’s imagination. .Four years later, when Italy hosted the World Cup, my colleagues from school and I fell in love with Cameroon’s national team – the Indomitable Lions – as it emerged as the surprise package of the tournament. Cameroon defeated a Maradona-led Argentina, Romania and Colombia, en route to becoming the first African team to reach the quarter-finals, where it lost 3-2 to England in a thrilling match. That team featured Roger Milla, a stylish and highly skilled 38-year-old striker who scored four extraordinary goals. .Zimbabwe hadn’t made it to the World Cup, but Cameroon’s players represented us, and millions of Africans, too. Their achievements made us so proud to be Black and African. They made us love the World Cup. .My experiences would come full circle when South Africa became the first and only African nation to host the World Cup in 2010. .I attended several matches, including Algeria versus Slovenia in Polokwane. I watched my longstanding favourites Cameroon, captained by the supremely talented Samuel Eto’o, fall 2-1 to Denmark in Pretoria. Later, I returned to Polokwane to see Argentina play Greece. To my delight, Lionel Messi was Argentina’s captain and Maradona was the coach. .On the night Ghana beat the United States, I socialised with Ghanaians and South Africans at a hangout spot in Rustenburg, a large mining town located 173km (107 miles) outside of Johannesburg. .Besides the highly entertaining matches, I embraced the priceless camaraderie of football. That it happened in South Africa – in Africa – made it that much sweeter. .Football, I believed, had finally come home. .I witnessed it as South Africans celebrated “Football Fridays” by wearing national team colours every Friday starting from September 2009. I sensed it in the pride and happiness that radiated from people’s faces before and especially during the tournament. I felt the mass of togetherness that evolved among South Africans and Africans alike when they rallied behind Ghana’s national team quarter-final run. And when Spain prevailed against Germany in the final team, I was convinced that every football-loving nation deserved to host the World Cup. .So I’m delighted to see Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a first for a Middle Eastern country. I understand what it means for Qatar and football enthusiasts in the Middle East and Africa. .Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, recently criticised the decision to award Qatar the right to host the 2022 tournament. Blatter said, “Qatar is a mistake” and called it a “small” country. .Clearly, shameless bigots like Blatter are unsettled by the steady evolution and democratisation of football. For years, “small” countries from the Global South have wholeheartedly supported the global game by participating in many competitions. .For decades, millions of people from “small” countries such as Liberia, Gabon, Burkina Faso and Morocco have increased FIFA’s substantial revenues by purchasing TV subscriptions, merchandise and match tickets. The Qatar World Cup could be the organisation’s most profitable event ever. .Still, for the most part, FIFA bosses have overlooked our widespread passion for football. Germany, Italy, France, Brazil, and Mexico, for example, have each hosted it twice. And European countries have, collectively, hosted 11 of 22 tournaments. .Suffice it to say that Blatter’s sentiments are tainted with white privilege and extreme indifference to the unquestionable need for fairer representation and participation in every sphere of football. .Since FIFA was established in 1904, seven of its eight presidents have been white, male and European. One, Issa Hayatou – an African – was acting president for 141 days in 2015-2016. .But despite their dubious efforts, Europeans cannot claim any special contribution to international football. African and Arab countries have long produced world-class teams and players, despite the socioeconomic consequences of colonialism. .Football has benefited immensely from the talents of stars such as Mozambique-born Eusebio, Algeria’s Mustapha Dahleb, Liberia’s George Weah, Ghana’s Abedi Pele, Morocco’s Aziz Bouderbala, Senegal’s Sadio Mané and Egypt’s Mohamed Salah, to name a few. .Qatar’s World Cup is just as special and historic as South Africa’s in 2010. The football establishment shouldn’t discriminate against Black and brown people from African and Arab countries. Or cast aspersions on Qatar’s ability to deliver a world-class event. .I am confident that this year’s World Cup will impress many 11-year-old Arab and African boys and girls, just as the 1986 competition wowed me. And I firmly believe that most Africans will stand with Qatar as it hosts the World Cup. .This, too, remember, is our tournament to treasure. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",582
583,Published On 14 Nov 2022,World Cup 2022: Ukrainian football fans back Poland and England,"Many will support allies playing in the tournament, which will largely be overshadowed by war.",".For some people in Ukraine, football has become a welcome distraction from the endless air raid sirens, Russian missile attacks and other harsh realities of war. .And while interest in the 2022 World Cup might be more muted than usual, committed fans are looking forward to the tournament. .Volodymyr Maklyakov, a 26-year-old Manchester City fan originally from Kharkiv but now living in western Ukraine, says that although he has not felt “any great emotions” in the build-up to the big event, he will do all he can to watch the games. .Doing so could prove difficult since Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy facilities in recent months, resulting in power shortages and blackouts. .Maklyakov would have supported his beloved Ukrainian national team had they not narrowly missed out on qualification after losing to Wales in a playoff game. .Instead, like many Ukrainian football fans this World Cup, he will be cheering for Poland and England in gratitude for their support during the war. .Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Poland has welcomed about 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees and provided almost $3bn in aid. .The United Kingdom has provided Ukraine with nearly $4bn in military aid. It has also been a strong diplomatic ally. .“I am very grateful to Poland because they are helping Ukraine,” Maklyakov said, adding that there have been many examples of the Polish football team showing solidarity with Ukraine. .Poland had been scheduled to play a World Cup qualifier with Russia in March. They refused to play after the team’s captain, Robert Lewandowski, led a boycott of the match. .Lewandowski has since pledged to wear a Ukrainian blue and yellow armband at the World Cup. It was given to him by former Ukraine captain and coach Andriy Shevchenko. .Erfan Kudusov, a Crimean Tatar based in Kyiv, says he will support England and Poland because he will be “forever grateful” for the hospitality they showed to his family who fled the war. .Igor Novikov, a former adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a lifelong Blackburn Rovers fan, said support for Poland is a “no-brainer” because the two nations enjoy “a brotherhood”. .“Now, football and politics are very much the same,” Iryna Koziupa, a Ukrainian sports journalist, said, adding, “We are looking at how each country behaves towards Ukraine during the war”. .Koziupa said other teams that are “friendly towards Ukraine during this war”, including the United States and Canada, will also enjoy Ukrainian support. .This political element means there will also be hostility towards what she describes as “unfriendly nations”. .Koziupa said Iran is a particularly unpopular team because Tehran supplies military drones to Russia, which have been used to target Ukraine’s infrastructure. .In October, the Ukrainian football federation urged FIFA to ban Iran from the World Cup, citing human rights violations and its supply of weapons to Russia. .“People are calling for Ukraine to take Iran’s place, especially given the group they are in with the US and England,” Novikov said. .A major Ukrainian club team, Shakhtar Donetsk, have appealed to FIFA to allow Ukraine to participate in the event of a ban on Iran. .Koziupa said the scandals surrounding FIFA and the host nation Qatar have diminished interest in the tournament. .“FIFA pretends there is no war and that people are not suffering in different parts of the world,” she said, referring to a recent letter sent by FIFA to World Cup teams urging them to avoid protests and “focus on the football”. .If Ukraine had qualified, Koziupa says it would have provided “an opportunity to tell the world about war through football as Shakhtar did in the Champions League”. .Shakhtar Donetsk recently competed in the European club tournament despite the war and losing a youth coach who was shot while fighting Russian forces. The team plays their home games in Poland. .But for others, the World Cup is still a simple affair and about supporting the best team. .Arsen Tartan, a Kyiv-based Arsenal fan with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game, said he “sincerely wishes his Polish brothers success” but he won’t be backing a particular team. .For Arsen, club loyalty is the most important, so he will support his beloved Arsenal players – new and old – as they play for their respective teams.",583

The clock is ticking down on the opening match, almost 12 years since Qatar was awarded hosting rights for football’s showpiece tournament. .On November 20, the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world will kick off with the host nation playing Ecuador. .It marks the culmination of Qatar’s extraordinary campaign to first win the vote to host the tournament and then embark on a spending spree of tens of billions of dollars to build stadiums and infrastructure. .Holding the event in a desert state has necessitated an unprecedented reorganisation of the international football calendar, shifting the World Cup from its normal slot in the northern hemisphere summer to avoid the Gulf country’s scorching heat. .The country of barely three million people, one of the world’s biggest producers of natural gas, has spent lavishly. .New stadiums cost more than $6.5bn and a driverless metro rail system with a price tag of $36bn serves five of the eight venues. .Some estimates put total infrastructure spending over the past decade at more than $200bn. .Organisers have estimated more than 1.2 million fans will travel to Qatar. They have responded to concerns about a lack of accommodation by using three cruise ships as floating hotels. They are fully booked for the first two weeks of the tournament. .Some 2.9 million of the 3.1 million tickets have been sold, organisers said, and fans have been waiting outside the FIFA ticketing centre hoping that scarce tickets will become available for the top games.",584

Brazil’s tournament pedigree will not dampen the spirits of this well-knit Serbian side, who have a strong attacking force and have had a successful run in the lead-up to the tournament. . .Serbia finished their World Cup qualifying campaign by beating Portugal away and topping their group. Captain Dusan Tadic credited coach Dragan Stojkovic with helping the team to elevate their performance during the qualification phase. .“The experience of playing at a World Cup is vital,” Tadic told Fifa.com. “Stojkovic has played at several World Cups, scored goals and provided assists and knows everything there is to know. He passes all this knowledge and experience on to us, and we love working with him.” .The Serbian “legend” transformed the team’s attack, bringing the desired results. Serbia played six UEFA Nations League matches this year and won four of them. .Aleksandar Mitrovic has been in superb form for his country. He top-scored in their World Cup qualifying group, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo, with eight goals, and scored another six in the Nations League. .The 28-year-old forward is brimming with confidence ahead of the tournament. .“We have a tough group with strong teams and excellent players, but that’s why we play the game,” he said. “We want to be there and compete with the best – we can’t wait. I’m very confident, but I think the whole team and the whole country feel the same.” .While Serbia have become a force to be reckoned with in attack, their problems in defence have been exposed. The retirement of Branislav Ivanovic and Aleksandar Kolarov may have helped on the flanks, but it has shorn them of experience at the back. .However, Stojkovic and his men will rely on the close bonds and recent experience of defeating big names to bring them success in Qatar. It also helps that most of the squad members were part of the FIFA Under-20 World Cup winning squad from 2015. .Tadic believes that the experience of winning on a big stage will help his side. .“Most of the players in the current Serbia team belong to that generation [Under-20 team], and I think that’s going to be a big plus for us,” he said. .If Serbia do not manage to reach the round-of-16, it will be seen as a disappointing result for a team that has had so much recent success. Mitrovic will have a big role to play in ensuring Serbia’s qualification, and he’s aware of the responsibility. .“You’re under a lot of pressure when you’re a striker,” he admitted. “I like to score and to feel the pressure on my shoulders. I know what everyone expects from me.” .The team, he said, is well prepared to meet the fans’ expectations. .“The best is yet to come. We’re in our prime.”",585

Only three teams from the continent have reached the last-eight at a World Cup, but Senegal reached that milestone in their first-ever appearance. .In 2002, they stunned reigning world and European champions France and scored in every game but one en route to a quarter-final finish. .Despite that rousing success, Senegal missed out on the following three editions and 2022 marks their first-ever qualification for consecutive World Cups. .Aliou Cisse, captain of their great adventure in 2002 and in the dugout for seven years now, will lead the Teranga Lions in a bid to put the disappointment of 2018 behind them. .In Russia, Senegal became the first team ever to be eliminated from the World Cup on the basis of fair play, a cruel blow that defender Kalidou Koulibaly believes they have learned from. .“We will not make the same mistake again,” the Chelsea centre-back told Al Jazeera. .“In 2018 we could’ve done better, but things didn’t work out, and it’s a shame because we had a great generation of players. In Qatar, we will benefit from that 2018 experience.” .They will also have the boost of coming in as African champions. Senegal took a while to assert themselves during the Africa Cup of Nations in January, making heavy weather of a group that featured Malawi and Zimbabwe. .However, they came into their own during the knockout rounds, and although they needed a penalty shootout in the final to prove it, the Lions were deserving winners. .In addition to being Senegal’s first-ever taste of silverware, that achievement lent legitimacy to their current generation, as well as to Cisse’s work. And it cemented their standing as the continent’s best hope of a deep run in Qatar. .“I think Senegal offer Africa’s best hope,” African football expert Mark Gleeson told Al Jazeera. “I hope that they can get to the quarters, but it depends who they have to play, of course, in the round of 16. I do see them going through, and I think they’ll be the only African side to do so.” .That expectation is enhanced by the draw. .The Netherlands will provide a thorny challenge in the opening game, but the rest of Group A is made up of hosts Qatar, in their maiden World Cup appearance, and South America’s last automatic qualifier, Ecuador. .On the strength of both the FIFA rankings and the relative quality of their squad, Senegal are favourites to advance. .“It’s going to be very difficult but it’s an open group,” Koulibaly admitted. .“Qatar (are) playing at home, the Netherlands are a great football nation – they have big players like Van Dijk, I played a lot against him – and Ecuador proved that they deserved to be here.” .Two-time African footballer of the year and Bayern Munich’s Sadio Mane is undoubtedly the Teranga Lions’ biggest star. .But in Edouard Mendy, Idrissa Gueye, Cheikhou Kouyaté, Ismaila Sarr, Abdou Diallo and Boulaye Dia they have players who have established themselves in Europe. .Since their title-winning effort in Cameroon, Senegal’s results have been underwhelming. .They came through a two-legged playoff against Egypt, but only on penalties after a 1-1 aggregate score, and they followed that up with a 3-1 win over 10-man Benin and a slim triumph – via a 98th-minute penalty – against Rwanda. .Results in pre-World Cup friendlies have also raised some concern. A routine win over Bolivia was followed by a 1-1 draw with Iran, in which Senegal appeared to lack imagination in attack. .That feeds into a wider concern. When Mane is shackled, it is often difficult to tell where the chances are coming from. .In spite of those recent wobbles, Koulibaly remains bullish about Senegal’s prospects in Qatar, and says the team have their eyes set on pushing the envelope at the World Cup. .“I don’t know about the other African teams but as captain of Senegal we are not going there to reach the normal ceiling of Africa, which is the quarter-finals,” he declared. .“I believe we can compete for the trophy like the other countries from different continents. We have no business at the World Cup if the plan is just to participate and go home after the group. That is such a defeatist mentality. If you go to battle thinking you are not good enough then you’ve already lost. .“Senegal is going to Qatar with the ambition to win and that is our mentality.”",591

And it was nothing less than the emergence of a new golden generation. Led by former Real Madrid and Tottenham superstar Gareth Bale, these new gladiators of Wales – Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Wayne Hennessey – recaptured the hearts and imaginations of the nation as they stormed to the Euro 2016 semi-final. .Four years later, a run to the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 did nothing to dampen the fires they had stoked back home. Suddenly, it seemed, Wales could play football. .The roots of this success go back much further, with many pointing to the hardworking and honest Gary Speed’s tenure as manager as the catalyst for Wales’s changing fortunes. .In the four years after his untimely death in 2011, Wales rose 109 places up the rankings, from 117 to eight. .“Gary started this 12, 13 years ago, and the changes he made, the professionalism he brought in, he led with those standards,” former Watford captain Rob Page, who has managed Wales since November 2020, told a gathering at the Senedd, the Welsh parliament. “I see that in Gareth [Bale] today, how he leads.” . .Wales faced a tough European qualifying campaign under Page to make it to Qatar, but finished second in a group featuring Belgium, ranked second in the world, and the Czech Republic. .Playoff victories over Austria and Ukraine in front of a jubilant home crowd followed, and Wales were booking their flights to Doha. .While Page takes with him to Qatar a team with a wealth of experience, he must suspect these may be some of the last internationals played by this group. Luckily for Page, and for the rest of Wales, he has 21-year-old Brennan Johnson to provide some fresh legs when the more senior players tire, and to build continuity for the future. .Watch out for his name on the scorecard in Qatar. .Facing England, the USA and Iran in their group, Wales will have high hopes of making it to the knockout stages. If they can keep their veterans injury-free, they’ll stand a chance of progressing further. .Regardless of what happens in Qatar, there is a new pride in Wales at booking their place at the World Cup. .“Yma o hyd, you sons of Speed,” actor Michael Sheen told the squad. “As they fall around us, we’re still here!”",596
597,Published On 13 Nov 2022,Now or never: Does football owe Messi a World Cup?,Qatar 2022 is the postscript for the Messi World Cup story that was supposed to have ended in Russia in 2018.,".Lionel Messi’s smile was melancholic as he answered the reporter’s question after Argentina’s loss to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final. .“That’s it for me, I’m done with the national team,” said Messi. “Like I said before, we lost four finals and it’s just not for me.” .The anguish was evident on Messi’s face in that interview, where he announced his international retirement in the immediate aftermath of the loss. .When asked if his decision was final, he was non-committal but pointedly added how it just had to be him to miss the decisive first penalty in the shootout. .For a man gifted a left foot that God created on Sunday, someone consecrated by millions across the world, it’s fitting that Messi is a strong believer in the power of destiny. .It’s something he often evokes when talking about Argentina. In the viral dressing room clip of his speech ahead of the 2021 Copa America final, he spoke of how there was no such thing as coincidence that the tournament was shifted from Argentina to Brazil. .“God brought it here for us to lift at the Maracana, boys,” he said passionately. . .Qatar 2022 will almost certainly be his closing act on the international stage. It is now or never for Messi but in one sense, so has been each of the last three World Cups. .In 2010, with Diego Maradona as manager, it felt written in the stars for the king and the heir to restore glory to Argentina for the first time since 1986. However, reality, and Germany, came crashing down on romance in South Africa. .The 2014 World Cup in Brazil coincided perfectly with the crest of Messi’s career, when he entered the tournament having won four consecutive Ballon d’Ors in the previous six years. .The supporting cast of Gonzalo Higuain, Angel di Maria, Javier Mascherano and Kun Aguero were arguably at the peak of their powers – the ingredients for success could not have been more ripe. An appearance in the final where they were eventually felled by Germany belied a mediocre showing that saw them score just two goals after the group stages. .“It is now or never for us, there is no more. We have to see this as our final World Cup and look at it as such and take advantage of the opportunity,” Messi said. .It’s a quote that would have applied to Argentina today but in actuality was said ahead of the World Cup in Russia in 2018. .They arrived as one of the oldest teams in the tournament, having secured qualification through the skin of their teeth. Argentina’s campaign was running on fumes from the start and it inevitably imploded in the round-of-16 against France. .Doha felt light years away from Kazan on that afternoon and many, including Messi, expected it to be his final bow. .Qatar is not a now-or-never World Cup for Messi, it’s a postscript for a movie that was supposed to have ended in Russia. .It’s tough to make sense of Messi’s World Cup performances. While there have been moments of genius – the injury-time winner against Iran in Brazil, the assist for Di Maria against Switzerland in the round-of-16, the touch and goal against Nigeria in 2018 – he is yet to score a goal in the knockout stages of the tournament. .For Argentina, he has seldom recreated the levels he consistently hits for his clubs. Close your eyes and think of Messi and the first image that comes up is of him in the blaugrana of Barcelona, hands aloft as the Camp Nou sways to his music. .Argentina has always been second fiddle to Messi’s iconography. .The searing images of Messi in blue and white are predominantly coloured by pain – the forlornness on his face as he posed with the Golden Ball in 2014, the uncontrollable tears in the Metlife arena after the Copa America loss in 2016, the manner in which he ignored Olivier Giroud’s outstretched hand in the tunnel after the loss to France in 2018. .While the Copa America triumph last year was a rare silver lining, it felt seismic not as much for the magnitude of the win as for the context behind it. .But, it isn’t just the lack of on-field success that led to the fraught nature of Messi’s relationship with Argentinian fans. .Jonathan Wilson, author of Angels with Dirty Faces: The Footballing History of Argentina, believes the roots of this issue can be found in an editorial published in the iconic Argentinian sports magazine El Gráfico in 1928. .“[The writer] says if you were to erect a statue of Argentinian football, it would be the urchin child in the streets, he’d have this massive dark hair, he’d be short and squat. His teeth would be worn down by eating yesterday’s bread, his shirt would be eaten by the mice [and] he’s coming from an impoverished background,” Wilson told Al Jazeera. .“When Maradona arrives it’s like ‘this is the one’ and broadly speaking, he lived up to that with huge lows whereas Messi, it’s a different physical type, he doesn’t fit the template, so I think there’ll always be that resistance in Argentina.” .While Messi’s move to Spain at a young age also added to the resistance he faced in Argentina, Wilson believes the turning point in his relationship with the fans came after his retirement announcement in 2016. .“When he missed the penalty against Chile, he was clearly so devastated. His tears and retirement that shocked people into ‘we need him back’ and there was this outpouring of ‘please don’t retire’,” added Wilson. .Such was the intensity of this sentiment in Argentina that the arrivals board of the subway in Buenos Aires read “No te vayas Lio” (Lio, don’t go). .He didn’t go back then but he will now. .Maybe football does owe Messi a World Cup, in the same way it owes Steven Gerrard a Premier League, Gigi Buffon a Champions League and Franck Ribery a Ballon d’Or. .Greatness is not always perfect and not winning the World Cup will not take away from Messi’s legacy. .But winning it would add so much.",597

They just have many more gadgets at their disposal, now. .Organisers say that the “connected stadium” concept is the first of its kind to be used during a World Cup. AI will enable technicians to predict crowd surges and quickly deal with overcrowding by sharing information with security officials. .The aim is to avoid incidents such as the chaos that erupted in May outside the Stade de France in Paris, when police used tear gas and pepper spray on fans trying to get into the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. .In October, more than 130 people were killed in a crowd crush at a football stadium in Indonesia after police fired tear gas at fans who streamed on to the pitch, followed by people running into locked exits while trying to exit the stadium. .The Qatar centre’s technical team says that data aggregation allows them to forecast crowd patterns. Since they know the exact number of people expected based on ticket sales, they can predict crowd surge. That could be based on time of arrival, points of entry or even the movement of people at any given time. .“We have the crowd control team and security staff on the ground, and we have the law enforcement agencies and we are complementing their decision-making with data. So that’s very unique,” Niyas Abdulrahiman, the centre’s chief technology officer, told Al Jazeera. .With the help of AI, the centre can count the number of people within a space and apply a threshold. If there are more than 100 people in a particular area, for example, the technicians can see bottlenecks, check how the entry gates are performing and ensure a smooth flow of people in and out of the stadium, Abdulrahiman explained. .All the stadiums are air-conditioned. If there is a temperature variance inside the venues, sensors from the command centre can pick up the data and prompt an adjustment. .“Through this command centre, our centralised platform gives us an opportunity to have a quick response, more performance in operations with less people,” Al Mohannadi told Al Jazeera. .The director is undeterred by cybersecurity threats. He said the systems are designed to withstand vulnerabilities. .“Obviously, all of this depends on foolproof cybersecurity that all of your systems should be able to withstand any threats from outside or within. We are making sure that systems are secure. And we are doing it as a routine now to make sure that during the FIFA World Cup any major cybersecurity incident will not happen.”",598

Kickoff in the opening match takes place on November 20, almost 12 years since the day Qatar was awarded hosting rights for the tournament. .The event will feature 32 teams and attract more than 1.2 million visitors to Qatar, which will become the first country in the Middle East to host football’s biggest tournament. .Here is a list of some other firsts at this year’s World Cup: .In July, football’s world governing body, FIFA, announced the use of a semi-automated offside system at the World Cup to help make fast and accurate offside calls. .According to the governing body’s rules, a player is in an offside position if “any part of the head, body or feet is in the opponents’ half (excluding the halfway line) and any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent”. .The technology uses a sensor in the ball and a limb-tracking camera system to follow the movements of players. To help fans and viewers at home understand the referee’s decision, the data will be used to project 3D images on stadium screens. .Teams will be allowed five substitutions in each game as opposed to three from the previous World Cup in Russia in 2018. .The regulation was introduced by football’s rule-setting body, the International Football Association Board, in 2020 after what it said was “a global analysis of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on football as well as representations from several key stakeholders from across the football community”. .If a World Cup game goes into extra time, one additional substitution will be allowed. .Several football leagues, including Spain’s La Liga and Major League Soccer in the United States, have implemented the change over the past two years. .Unlike previous tournaments, Qatar 2022 will be taking place during the months of November and December. .Previously, the World Cup had always been held during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer, often in June and July. The change was made to avoid high temperatures in Qatar, which can reach up to 50C (122F) during that period. .During the tournament, temperatures are predicted to range from 14C to 31C (57F to 88F). .In November, participating countries will name squads containing a maximum of 26 players, three more than what was allowed at the World Cup in Russia. .According to FIFA, the change was made due to the “unique timing” of the tournament being held in November and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. .The World Cup preliminary squad list was also expanded from a maximum 35 players to 55. .For the first time at the men’s World Cup, three women have been included among the 36 referees selected for Qatar 2022. .France’s Stephanie Frappart, Japan’s Yoshimi Yamashita and Rwanda’s Salima Mukansanga have all previously officiated at a men’s tournament, including the UEFA Super Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations. .“It’s a strong sign from FIFA and the authorities to have women referees in that country,” Frappart said. “I’m not a feminist spokesperson, but if this can make things happen …” .Joining them will be three other women who will serve among the 69 assistant referees. .With an area of little more than 11,500sq km (4,440sq miles) and a population of around 2.9 million, Qatar will be the smallest country ever to host FIFA’s flagship tournament. .All eight stadiums are located within a 50km (31-mile) radius of the capital, Doha. During the group stages, most days will feature up to four games. .While Qatar and FIFA say the “compact” nature of the tournament will allow people to watch multiple matches a day, critics argue that an influx of more than 1.2 million people could lead to major congestion on the streets, making it more difficult for people to move around the country. .“Having four matches in a day is a challenge in a city like Doha,” Abdulaziz Ali Al-Mawlawi of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, organiser of the tournament, said last month. “… Of course, we are expecting to have congestion on the streets.” .Schools in Qatar will remain closed during the World Cup while office working hours have been reduced.",599

That, and a string of saves from their experienced Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, ensured the team a spot in Qatar. .Before beating Sweden, Poland had a less-than-impressive qualifying campaign, finishing second behind England in their group. .The Poles, who are ranked 26, will make their ninth appearance at the global football competition since their debut at the 1938 showpiece in France. .Poland has seen mixed results at their previous World Cups. Twice the Poles have finished third but since 1982, they have only made it past the group stage once and failed to qualify for the 2010 and 2014 editions of the tournament. .At Russia 2018, the team lost to Senegal and Colombia but were knocked out with a solitary win – against Japan. .This year, the White and Red are in Group C with Mexico and Saudi Arabia, as well as South American giants Argentina, who have won the competition twice. .The star of the team is the Barcelona goal machine Lewandowski. The forward, who joined the Catalan club after a protracted transfer from the German heavyweights Bayern Munich, has more than 600 career goals for club and country. .The tournament could be the last chance for Lewandowski, 34, to make his mark at a World Cup. In 2020, after scoring 41 league goals for Bayern Munich – a record for a Bundesliga season – Lewandowski was crowned FIFA men’s player of the year. .In October, Lewandowski was awarded the Gerd Muller Trophy, given to the best striker of the year. .The Poles will open their campaign against Mexico’s El Tri (The Tricolour) on November 22.",600
601,Published On 12 Nov 2022,What happened in the Premier League today?,,".It was Ivan Toney’s day at the Etihad in the early Premier League kick-off. The Brentford forward bounced back from the disappointment of not making it to England’s World Cup squad by scoring a brace that saw his side defeat Manchester City 2-1. .Brentford showed no signs of timidity on their visit to the Premier League champions and opened the scoring in the 16th minute with an opportunistic header from Toney. Phil Foden’s half-volley levelled things going into halftime, but Brentford held firm against the relentless onslaught on their goal, and Toney grabbed the winner in the 8th minute of injury time. .In the post-match press conference, Thomas Frank called it the “single biggest result” in the club’s history. The loss leaves Manchester City rooted in 2nd place and means that Arsenal will enter the World Cup break top of the table. . .Antonio Conte’s Tottenham side is making a habit out of second-half comebacks as they thrice came back from a goal down to defeat Leeds United 4-3. Rodrigo’s smart finish in the 76th minute looked like the final nail in the coffin, but driven on by the marauding Dejan Kulusevski on the right wing, Spurs didn’t back down. Rodrigo Bentancur equalised in the 81st minute and again scored two minutes later to send Spurs temporarily into third place. .Liverpool eased to a 3-1 win in Nathan Jones’ first game as Southampton boss. Roberto Firmino opened the scoring for Liverpool and a first-half brace from Darwin Nunez saw the game essentially wrapped up by halftime. Nunez has come under a great deal of scrutiny since his arrival in the Premier League, but the Uruguayan has a commendable nine goals in 10 starts for the club in all competitions. . .Elsewhere in the Premier League, Bournemouth beat Everton 3-0 to heap the pressure on Toffees’ boss Frank Lampard whose side has won just one of its last five games and lie in 17th. Bournemouth were strongly tipped for relegation at the start of the season, but now enter the World Cup break 13th on the table.

But they have never been a football powerhouse. .When they hosted the 1994 World Cup, serious proposals were made so the event would be more attractive to sponsors, such as dividing the games into four quarters and have larger goals. .Despite criticism of the World Cup being awarded to a country with little culture of the sport, it remained very successful and had an average attendance of nearly 70,000. .Moreover, qualifying for 10 World Cup tournaments is no easy feat, not least for a country without a professional league for much of that time. The North American Soccer League, founded in 1967, collapsed in 1984, and Major League Soccer was not established until 1993. .Back at that very first World Cup in Uruguay in 1930, USA saw off Paraguay and Belgium before being routed 6-1 in the semi-finals by Argentina. Interest in football waned for decades in the US, with faster, higher-scoring sports such as American football and basketball taking centre stage. .Other than a brief appearance to finish bottom of their group in the 1950 tournament, USA did not qualify for another World Cup until 1990 – when another barrel-scraping performance saw the Americans removed. .Hosting the World Cup in 1994, a spirited 1-0 loss to Brazil saw USA depart in the round of 16 – their best World Cup performance of the modern era. At the 2002 event hosted by South Korea and Japan, they went all the way to the quarter-finals, where they were sent home by a towering header from Germany’s Michael Ballack. .A winless appearance in the 2006 tournament ensured another quiet four years for US football. But a strong showing at South Africa 2010, with draws against England and Slovenia, and a crucial win over Algeria, again saw USA progress to the round-of-16 only to be sent home by the Black Stars of Ghana. .Four years later, however, USA had their revenge as they beat Ghana in their opening match of Brazil 2014. A draw against Portugal kept the run going until Belgium ended their dreams in the round-of-16 again. .The team looks good this time around. Its qualification run saw an unbeaten home record. .Look out for Christian Pulisic – “Captain America” – whose 84 appearances for Chelsea in the English Premier League and 90 for Germany’s Borussia Dortmund have netted him no fewer than 33 goals. .Qatar 2022 sees USA in probably the tournament’s most-competitive group, facing England and Wales on growing form. .Keep an eye for the likely banter around the Wales game, after the purchase (and documentary “Welcome to Wrexham”) of Wrexham AFC by Canada’s Ryan Reynolds and Philadelphia’s Rob McElhenney brought the flavour of Welsh football to new audiences in the US and beyond.",606

FIFA was about to announce the hosts for the 2022 World Cup. .My fingers were certainly getting a good workout as decision time got closer that snowy December day. .The inbox on my banged-up Nokia was filling up with notes from colleagues inside the toasty confines of the Messe Hall, and all had a similar refrain. .“Qatar think they might just have got it” would best summarise the overall sentiment. A live feed of the grand envelope opening was being fed into my ear as former FIFA boss Sepp Blatter stepped up to deliver the words that changed a nation forever. .“The winner to host the two twenty-two FIFA World Cup is Qatar!” .Not only did we have a new way of saying 2022, but football’s biggest tournament also had a new home. .The next day, a shivering press huddle gathered outside the hotel where Qatar’s bid team was staying. The head of the committee, Hassan Al Thawadi, took a few questions before leaving for the airport. .The main theme that morning was Qatar’s weather and the high temperatures in June and July when the World Cup is traditionally held. There was also the “lack of footballing culture” charge thrown at Al Thawadi. .That was just day one of Qatar being in the global spotlight like never before. The pointed questions in that freezing Swiss car park were just the start. .With an unprecedented 12-year build-up, this World Cup has been scrutinised like no other. My hope is that the idealism rather than the criticism of the 2010 bid does become a reality; that fans will be able to travel to more than one game per day; that sceptics visiting the Middle East for the first time have some of their preconceptions changed. .Any veterans of that chilly morning in Switzerland may also note that air-conditioned stadiums have been built and Qatar’s national team that kicks off this World Cup will do so as reigning Asian Cup champions. .Most of all, I’m looking forward to seeing this World Cup reflected through the eyes of my young son. He’s just one of the many changes that have occurred in my life since that vote more than a decade ago. A formative footballing memory of mine is watching the 1982 World Cup as a seven-year-old and falling in love with the yellow Brazilian jersey. .It opened my eyes to a beguiling world beyond the mud and chill winds of English football. It confirmed in my mind that this game would forever be a part of my life. My son can’t wait to watch the world’s best at their best. He wants to see goals, recreate them in the back garden and relive them in his dreams. .For a few days at least, we should all be allowed to welcome a little wide-eyed joy back into our lives.",607

FIFA currently ranks them 10th in the world. .For a country of fewer than six million people, Denmark’s men’s national football team has punched above its weight. .The team, and the nation, announced themselves on the world stage in the ’80s and ’90s, earning the nickname “Danish Dynamite” and picking up a bronze in the 1984 European Championships before eventually winning the tournament in 1992. .It was also during this period that several Danish players broke onto the international scene, including the Laudrup brothers, who between them won five La Liga titles and two Seria A titles, as well as Peter Schmeichel, widely considered one of the best goalkeepers of all time. .However, success at the European Championships failed to translate to the World Cup. The Danes first qualified for the tournament in 1984 but would only make it past the round of 16 once in 1998 when they were beaten by a star-studded Brazil team 3-2 in a scintillating quarter-final. .The current Danish squad boasts a healthy balance of experience and exciting new talent. .In goal, they have the ever-reliable Kasper Schmeichel, who plays for Premier League side Leicester City and is the son of legend Peter. .At centre back, Denmark’s manager Kasper Hjulmand will likely pick the tried-and-tested duo of AC Milan’s Simon Kjaer and FC Barcelona’s Andreas Christensen. Joakim Mæhle, the Atalanta full-back who impressed during the 2020 European Championships with his trademark lung-bursting runs down the touchline and precise passing, is also expected to make the starting XI. .In defensive midfield, Denmark can call on their stalwart Thomas Delaney, who currently plies his trade for Spanish side Sevilla. He will be joined by Tottenham Hotspur’s Pierre-Emile Kordt Højbjerg and Manchester United’s Eriksen. .Upfront Hjulmand has regularly fielded Kasper Dolberg, a 25-year-old forward currently on loan at Sevilla. Mikkel Damsgaard, who plays for Premier League side Brentford, will likely be deployed as a traditional winger on the left side. Veteran striker Martin Braithwaite, who recently moved from FC Barcelona to rivals Espanyol, is also likely to make an appearance. .Denmark should progress from Group D, which includes Australia, France and Tunisia. .They can draw confidence from recent victories over France and will fancy themselves against Australia. .Tunisia could prove formidable opposition depending on what team turns up on the day. The Eagles of Carthage have experienced an unpredictable form of late, reaching the 2021 Arab Cup Final but then crashing out of the African Cup of Nations quarter-finals to Burkina Faso a month later. .If Denmark progress as runners-up in Group D, they could face Argentina, one of the tournament’s favourites. .",608

Group stage fixtures: Morocco (November 23), Canada (November 27),  Belgium (December 1). .Small but mighty Croatia will hope to follow up on their remarkable journey to the final four years ago and make inroads again at the Qatar World Cup 2022. .This year’s tournament will likely mark a last tilt at football’s most prestigious trophy for several key players, with the Adriatic nation expected to progress to at least the beginning of the knockout phase. .Croatia has competed in five World Cups since the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, beginning with the 1998 tournament in France. They have featured in every tournament since, barring the 2010 edition, held in South Africa, for which they failed to qualify. .In 2018, the team weaved its way way to a first World Cup before losing to France. .Along the way, they picked up maximum points in the group stages with wins over Argentina, Nigeria and Iceland. That was followed by knockout wins against Denmark and Russia on penalties, before beating England in a hard-fought, semi-final victory secured in extra time. .Their journey to eventual runners-up represented the country’s best-ever performance, outdoing a semi-final appearance in 1998 which saw them again beaten by France. .Croatia enter the tournament in excellent form, having recently topped their UEFA Nations League group – containing France, Denmark and Austria – following a confidence-boosting run of victories against all three sides in the European competition. .Luka Modric will once again be critical to Croatia’s hopes of success. .The 37-year-old playmaker still pulls the strings for his team, captaining the side and engineering its attacking play from central midfield. .His creativity threatens to pose problems for even the best-organised teams and will be pivotal for a side better renowned for its midfield and defensive resources than its forward talent. .His influence at the 2018 World Cup was enormous. He scored two and registered one assist in a flurry of high-class performances that saw him recognised as the tournament’s best player with the Golden Ball award. .A hugely admired footballer, Modric was later the same year awarded the prestigious Ballon d’Or, the highest individual accolade in the sport, and has also won an array of trophies at club level with Spanish giants Real Madrid. .Croatia is predicted to qualify with relative ease from Group F, alongside Belgium. .According to the latest Fifa rankings, the side is the 12th best in the world and their exciting blend of experienced stars – including Modric, winger Ivan Perisic and midfielder Mateo Kovacic – and promising youngsters is anticipated to prove too strong for Canada and Morocco. .Croatia – a football-loving country of four million people in which the sport has even been linked with the birth of the nation itself – has a history of dumbfounding expectations and battling its way past more illustrious rivals. .If the side can navigate its way through the round-of-16, momentum will gather for an unlikely, but certainly not impossible, run at a first World Cup title.",609

Employed within the Borussia Dortmund youth setup in Germany, Addo had no experience of coaching at senior level and came with no guarantees. .It proved a masterstroke as the Black Stars edged the two-legged playoff against Nigeria on away goals and secured a place at the World Cup, having missed out in 2018. .It was only 12 years ago that, in becoming the third African side to reach the last-eight and only the second to advance to the knockout phases in back-to-back World Cups, things were looking up for Ghana. .But that momentum was halted when the Black Stars crashed out in the group stage in 2014, making headlines after flying $3m in cash out to Brazil to assuage squad unrest over unpaid bonuses. .Since reaching the 2015 AFCON final, there has been an unmistakable slide. Making it to the World Cup arrested that, but six months later some of the shine has gone off the rose. .A number of factors have now cast doubt over the Black Stars prospects in Qatar, and going into the World Cup, the mood in the streets of Accra and Kumasi is overwhelmingly negative. .“People are not too excited about the fact that the Black Stars do not seem to have a team, even after so many months and playing in qualifiers,” Ghanaian journalist Saddick Adams told Al Jazeera. “Resentment has been there since the disastrous AFCON campaign in January.” .Since scraping past Nigeria in March, Ghana have only won two of their subsequent six matches – against Madagascar and Nicaragua. In between, they have drawn with Central African Republic and Chile, and suffered heavy three-goal margin defeats at the hands of Japan and Brazil. . .These dismal results – as well as the lethargic, unimaginative performances that accompanied them and some puzzling personnel choices – have called into question Addo’s ability to manage the Black Stars. .It has also led many to question over his continued involvement with Borussia Dortmund: the reluctance to commit to the national team full time has been deemed an indication of a lack of commitment and investment on his part. .This lack of clarity reflects poorly on the Ghana FA, according to African football expert Mark Gleeson. .“The fact that they have a coach who has had no coaching experience at senior level, and seemed to have appointed this man on a wing and a prayer really, and then kept him after getting past Nigeria, which as you know, was a completely fortuitous result. To my mind, that beggars belief,” Gleeson told Al Jazeera. .“That’s just shows the FA’s decision-making is fairly amateurish and I think they’re going to pay the price for that, which is a real pity.” .With so much background noise, there is a real chance Ghana could implode in Qatar. .Their prospects are hardly bright as is, given their draw. In Portugal, Uruguay and South Korea, they will face the ghosts of World Cups past, as well as some of the premier attackers in world football: Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani and Son Heung-Min (injury permitting), to name a few. .“It’s actually sad. If Ghana had their act together, Group H is not as difficult as it looks on paper,” journalist Solace Chukwu told AlJazeera. .“Uruguay are in a transitional phase at the moment. Fernando Santos’ negativity, in addition to an ageing defence, is holding Portugal back; and Korea are always competitive. This is far from a hopeless group. It’s just a shame Ghana are so lacking in organisation at the moment.” .The Ghana FA’s latest preparatory gambit, the announcement of two days of prayer and fasting, has led to widespread derision. .Seventy-one percent of Ghana’s population is Christian, with 17 percent Muslim and a small segment adhering to traditional indigenous religions. .Those statistics understate the fervency of everyday faith, but whether an appeal to the divine will be of any actual benefit to the Black Stars’ chances in Qatar remains to be seen.",610

Some are even being questioned if the country they are playing for is the country they are from.  What is the history of nationality in football and can it keep up with the global world of today? .In this episode:  .Connect with us: .@AJEPodcasts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook .Full episode transcript: .This transcript was created using AI. It’s been reviewed by humans, but it might contain errors. Please let us know if you have any corrections or questions, our email is TheTake@aljazeera.net.  .Halla Mohieddeen: Migration, immigration, nationality. They’re complicated issues. Governments struggle with them. Families struggle with them and over the decades, football’s been struggling with them too. .Maher Mezahi: There are still, I know in Ghana, people crossing their fingers hoping that players like Callum Hudson-Odoi or Eddie Nketiah will finally make the switch from England to Ghana. .Halla Mohieddeen: Just days away from the start of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Ghanaian fans are hoping to add a few more players to their team. .Maher Mezahi: These are players that played for clubs like Chelsea and Arsenal, some of the biggest clubs in the world, and that could still provide a plus for the Ghana national team. So this is still happening at the very last minute. .Halla Mohieddeen: Could there be more last-minute nationality change-ups? Will they change the course of the World Cup? And what is driving these players and others around the world to make the switch? I’m Halla Mohieddeen and this is The Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Maher Mezahi’s been busy recently tallying a list of last-minute World-Cup-related nationality change-ups. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Maher Mezahi: We had these players switch to African national teams: Bryan Mbeumo, Georges-Kevin N’Koudou, Olivier Ntcham, Inaki Williams, Tariq Lamptey, Denis Odoi, Rami Kaib, Yan Valery, Chaim El Djebali, Ismail Jakobs … .Halla Mohieddeen: Maher goes on to list more than 10 players who changed nationalities in the past few months. He reports on football in Africa for Al Jazeera and other outlets. And watching where players start and where they end up is part of the job. .Maher Mezahi: You have to understand that the sports eligibility laws, when it comes to nationality, has been something that’s really been changing and shifting over the last 20 years. .Halla Mohieddeen: Like these players, where he’s from – is also complicated. .Maher Mezahi: I moved to Algeria at the age of 25. .Halla Mohieddeen: Maher’s also Canadian. He grew up there. .Maher Mezahi: And so it’s just been really cool to see Canada make it. Algeria hasn’t made it. But I’m a pan-Africanist at heart. I’m gonna go for the five African teams. .Jay Harris: Dual nationality is not just complicated in football. It’s complicated in life. .Halla Mohieddeen: We’ll also hear from Jay Harris. He is in London and writes for the sports site The Athletic. .Jay Harris: I was born in the United Kingdom, but my dad’s side of the family are from Barbados. Also, I found out a few years ago that my grandma’s side can be traced back to Ghana. So I had my hopes pinned on England and Ghana getting revenge on Uruguay. .Luis Vidal: My name is Luis Vidal and I’m a sports writer for Eighteen.com, a soccer website based in Colorado. I write in English and Spanish. .Halla Mohieddeen: Luis is Chilean by birth but lives in Boston now. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: So, even for those covering the sport – nationality can be tricky. But to better understand what’s happening- it’s probably helpful to go back to Maher and Africa where FIFA’s latest rules about nationality got their start. .Maher Mezahi: What happened is African nations lobbied FIFA on three occasions: 2004, 2009, and most recently in 2017, to get eligibility rules changed, so that they could recruit a lot of players from the diaspora. .Halla Mohieddeen: And particularly from Europe. Maher describes the European teams as superpowers. They’ve won more than half of the world cups. .Maher Mezahi: There were these great African players born in France or Spain, or England, and they would play for those youth national teams, but then they weren’t quite good enough to play for those superpowers of world football, at the World Cups. But, they were still good enough to make a real impact with the African national teams. .Halla Mohieddeen: And Maher remembers one particular player, who literally changed the game. He was born in Spain, but his parents were from Morocco. .Maher Mezahi: His name is Munir El Haddadi. The highly touted youngster came up through the ranks at FC Barcelona, one of the most famous teams in the world. .Newsreel: Haddadi!  .Maher Mezahi: And at the age of 17 to 18, they wanted to select him to play for the Moroccan national team. Spain comes in and calls him up. They know Morocco’s interested. So Spain will say, ‘Come play for the Spanish national team,’ to block his eligibility because once he plays for the Spanish senior team, that’s it. .Halla Mohieddeen: At that time, according to FIFA rules, once you play for one national team or federation, there is no path to playing for any other country, including Morocco again. .Maher Mezahi: He would’ve been blocked for the rest of his life. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s what happened. Because he played for Spain in 2014, he was stuck playing for Spain. .Maher Mezahi: So Morocco is frustrated with that. .Halla Mohieddeen: Particularly because they’d just qualified for the World Cup. This was 2018, and it was the first time Morocco had made it this far in decades. So they had high hopes and thought Munir could help. Munir is a good player – a lot better than you or me. But according to Maher, he wasn’t at the very top. .Maher Mezahi: He’s in that position of limbo where not good enough for Europe, but good enough for Morocco to make a difference. So, the Moroccan Federation, they petitioned FIFA and they said, ‘Please, let’s change the law. Let’s not make it if the player played once for the senior national team, he’s automatically tied to that team for the rest of his life. Let’s make it three matches.’ Because one match, they should be able to see if they like the other setup, and so it took two, three years to be approved, but FIFA finally agreed, .Halla Mohieddeen: And in 2020, FIFA made their last change to the nationality rules. .Maher Mezahi: Morocco was spearheading that change and now Munir plays for the Moroccan national team. .Newsreel: It’s Morocco, go forward. It’s Munir, Munir with the shot, corner pocket … .Maher Mezahi: A happy ending to the story. .Halla Mohieddeen: A happy ending for Morocco, at least. And Europe went along with it, Maher says, because the players Africa usually taps aren’t the very top of the top. But European national teams can still put up a fight if there’s a player they really want. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Maher Mezahi: European nations have been known to do that. If they know an African team is interested, they might step in and call the player up just to block them, and then they’ll know in the future if they actually want to use that player or not. What some European teams can get frustrated about is they’re gonna say, ‘We’ve invested so much in our academies, this player was educated in our country. Speaks the language, often speaks better Spanish than Arabic.’ And they’ll feel like we’ve wasted all these resources and now he’s gonna go play for Morocco. And so you can understand how Spain or France would be quite frustrated at times. .Halla Mohieddeen: And there is a longer story here too. In the 1970s and ‘80s, the dynamic was different – not as many African players were playing in Europe. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Maher Mezahi: Actually, a lot of African governments, they had socialist tendencies and they could be a little bit hardline. And what they would do is they would prohibit players from leaving the country to play in Europe until they were 28 years old. That was seen as an age where perhaps they’re past their prime and they can go make some money abroad in Europe. But really, since the ‘90s and that explosion of the commodification of world football the Sky Sports deal in with the Premier League, and the money that’s been injected into European football, it’s almost impossible to hold onto players on the continent now. .Newsreel: Sky had all their football rights and that’s what drove their subscriber growth. The premier leagues have unanimously agreed to a three-year renewal of the UK broadcasting rights deal which will take them up until 2025 …  .Maher Mezahi: If they’re good enough to play Champions League football in Europe, they’re gonna go to Europe to make the money, but also to play at a high level. I mean, if they want to keep progressing and getting better, they’re gonna wanna play in those matches, and I don’t think anybody holds that against them. .Halla Mohieddeen: And so in the last two or three World Cups Maher says African countries have been going on these recruiting missions to Europe – with one goal: .Maher Mezahi: Grab as many players as they can. So that’s what I’ve been keeping a track of. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s how Maher came up with his list. Each of the players has their own story, he says. .Maher Mezahi: For some, it’s as easy as saying, ‘OK, I want to play for you and I’ll show up.’ For others, they’ve been tracking them for years and years on end. .Halla Mohieddeen: And some of these African teams have gotten quite sophisticated in their recruiting process. .Maher Mezahi: Some of these federations have full-time scouts or a designated person within the federation whose sole purpose is to find these players and to recruit them. Federations in Africa, they fall under the umbrella of the Ministry of Sport, which is of course part of the federal government budget. And so these federations will have millions and millions of dollars at their disposal at times. .In some countries I know that federations have sponsoring deals with, let’s say, a mobile telecom company. .Halla Mohieddeen: It’s easy to get cynical about all of this. But Maher says despite the money and the power these recruiters have, the message comes down to one thing: .Maher Mezahi: Your family’s gonna be so proud of you representing your country. It’s nothing like you’ve ever experienced before. They will try to tug on the heartstrings. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Maher Mezahi: And football, despite its increased commodification, I think that still is the core message. .Halla Mohieddeen: But then there’s the question about what happens once these players arrive in their new home. .Didi Dramani: Inaki Williams is playing for Athletic Bilbao. He didn’t grow up in Ghana. .Halla Mohieddeen: Didi Dramani is an assistant coach for Ghana’s national team, The Black Stars. .Newsreel: Here’s Inaki Williams. .Halla Mohieddeen: And when Inaki came to Ghana, Dramani was impressed. .Didi Dramani: I listened to his interviews and he tried to even speak the Ghanaian languages. And then, when I meet him, I greet him in Ghanaian, and he responds in Ghanaian. So these are small details. They are small things, but very huge. .Halla Mohieddeen: Enock Muchinjo wishes more players had that attitude. He’s a sportswriter from Zimbabwe. .Enock Muchinjo: There’s been circumstances when African teams have been trying to get European-born players and it has taken quite a long time to convince some of them. I think when it’s reached to a point whereby somebody has to think twice that search has to stop then and there. .Halla Mohieddeen: Right now there are only five African teams in the World Cup and 13 European teams. And if these players don’t want to play in Africa, they need to change the rules in a different way, he says. .Enock Muchinjo: We need to have more African teams first in the World Cup to attract these kinds of players to want to play for their countries of origin. .Halla Mohieddeen: But do Latin American and Caribbean countries, teams and players feel the same way? That’s after the break. .Halla Mohieddeen: In London, Jay Harris writes for the sports site The Athletic. .Jay Harris: It’s just something that’s always intrigued me how footballers come to a decision about who they should represent. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Are there any nationalities or countries which tend to see this more than others, players switching nationality or leaving their country to play for another one? .Jay Harris: Yeah, England again is another obvious example. You only need to look at England’s potential squad ahead of the World Cup to see how diverse it is and the influence from so many different countries. Maybe two of the most obvious ones are Declan Rice and Jack Grealish. They had represented the Republic of Ireland and then obviously switched to England. You’ve got Raheem Sterling who was born in Jamaica and now plays for England. There’s obviously large pockets of Afro-Caribbean communities across the UK. Any country that’s got a lot of immigrant communities, I think it’s a fairly common phenomenon. .Halla Mohieddeen: Why do you think this happens? .Jay Harris: Nationality obviously strikes at the heart of personal identity. And without getting too philosophical, that’s something that changes throughout a person’s life. So, for example, I spoke to one player, Gavin Hoyte. .Newsreel: Gavin Hoyte an advanced position, picks up the rebound and slots it at home. So, that’s four.  .Jay Harris: He played for England, at the under-17 World Cup. This is way back in 2007. England and Trinidad and Tobago, both qualified and Trinidad and Tobago approached him, and he said he felt he almost didn’t deserve to represent Trinidad and Tobago at that point in his life. He’d never been over there. He was born and raised in England. He grew up dreaming or playing for England at Wembley. He was playing for Arsenal at the time. He just felt like it’s not right for me to go and take someone else’s place. But then obviously as he’s grown up and maybe his cultural connection to his country’s become even stronger, and he didn’t get the opportunity to play for England, he’s then revisited that and he switched his mind. And Gavin Hoyte, had never been to Trinidad before. And he was very aware of that. And he said, I was a little bit concerned that the players would look at me as if I was a foreigner, someone who was born and raised in England, spoke in a different way, dressed in a different way, behaved in a different way, was coming into the squad. And he said, they just all treated me amazingly. .Halla Mohieddeen: Is there something in football, like if, you know, footballers think, well, I can’t make the grade for the England team. Is that a factor at all or not? .Jay Harris: Yeah, I think it’s a fair thing to say, if you kind of break it down, the last Caribbean team, for example, to qualify for a World Cup was Trinidad and Tobago in 2006. The kind of infrastructure and the organisation for those countries is nowhere near the same level as a France, an England, a Germany, a Spain. So as a professional, ambitious footballer, I’ve then gotta say, well do I play for the country that I’ve got a closer connection to? Although I’m probably never gonna play at the pinnacle. Or do I switch eligibility to England? .Halla Mohieddeen: It’s A difficult calculation to make. And I know there have been some complaints from African and Caribbean players about fair treatments in Europe. Is that something that encourages them to leave Europe or the UK to play for teams elsewhere? .Jay Harris: You would imagine so. I can’t think of any specific example where players have come out and very publicly spoken about feeling maybe undervalued by one association and switching to another. But I think what it comes down to is kind of feeling comfortable and feeling like you can be yourself. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: Yeah, you know, I was born in the UK. My father was Lebanese, It is really interesting this sort of idea of, where are you from? Where does your allegiance lie? .Jay Harris: If you feel very aligned with English culture, maybe that’s where you stay. Whereas I’ve got lots of friends. One of my best friends is from Cameroon, and even though he was born and raised in England, he speaks French when he is at home. The language of Cameroon. So, I’m sure he does feel far more attached to Cameroon than he does to England. So he might feel like this is a far better representation of who I am as a person and my cultural identity. I’d rather play for Cameroon. It just depends on each individual’s circumstances. .Halla Mohieddeen: We’ve named a number of players who have dual nationalities and have played for different countries. But in some ways, we’ve just scratched the surface. Lionel Messi, arguably the best in the game, plays for Argentina, his home country, but he also has citizenship in Spain. The US team has a number of players with dual nationalities. And as Maher, who we first heard from reminds us, the host country Qatar is really small. .Newsreel: The 2022 FIFA World Cup is … Qatar! .Halla Mohieddeen: Their native population is a fraction of the country’s actual population, and their team has players who hail from a variety of different countries. .Maher Mezahi: They have players that are from Sudan. They have players from Algeria. They have players from Iraq. They’ve been playing for the Qatari national team for more than 10 years now. But it becomes interesting from an identity standpoint. Do Qatar’s supporters feel like these players really represent them? Are they gonna be proud of their successes? .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: And now, even days ahead of the World Cup’s November 20 start date – questions of nationality are still being decided. With the potential to change the entire line-up. And sports blogger Luis Vidal says this is a big issue. .Luis Vidal: So, Byron Castillo, according to the official paper, he’s an Ecuadorian citizen, born in a town called Playas. .Halla Mohieddeen: An Ecuadorian citizen playing for Ecuador in the World Cup – simple enough. .Luis Vidal: However, Chile, claimed that his documents were forged as he’s in reality a Colombian citizen born in a town called Tumaco. .Newsreel: Chile’s FA claims that Ecuador right-back Byron Castillo shouldn’t have played in eight World Cup qualifiers because he’s actually Colombian.  .Luis Vidal: And following that logic, since he’s not an Ecuadorian citizen, again, according to Chile, he shouldn’t have been eligible to play for Ecuador. And why is Chile so interested in this? .Halla Mohieddeen: Because if Byron Castillo is Colombian – that could give Chile a chance at the World Cup with just days before the opening match. .Newsreel: That would mean that Chile would take Ecuador’s place at the World Cup. .Luis Vidal: So, it’s days before the opening game between Ecuador and Qatar. .Newsreel: The court acknowledges that Castillo’s passport contained false information, but maintains that the footballer was eligible to play in the World Cup qualifying preliminary phase. Ecuador was sanctioned for the case of the player Byron Castillo but will be able to play in the World Cup in Qatar. .Halla Mohieddeen: And Luis admits the Castillo case is pretty rare, but when it comes to migration and football, the system is far from perfect. .Luis Vidal: It could be better. There used to be, like, a more fair thing between South America and Europe. But most of the talent went to Europe, and it started to be a little more difficult for South America to catch up. A lot of African players started to play for national teams in Europe, too. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Halla Mohieddeen: One idea he says is opening up the World Cup to more African, Asian and South American teams. The other is to recognise that immigration happens. It’s part of the world we live in today. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Luis Vidal: We live in a society where immigration is a normal thing to do, a way for looking for opportunities. But I don’t know how that could be transmitted in a legal way or in a way that left everybody happy .Halla Mohieddeen: Jay Harris agrees. Life is complex, but in sport, you still have to pick sides. .Jay Harris: In football, you’re either one or the other. Whereas, in real life, we’re all just a kind of perfect blend of all the different places and countries that we come from. .Halla Mohieddeen: And that’s the Take.

613,Published On 11 Nov 2022,Injured Mane included in Senegal squad for World Cup 2022,Senegal coach says he is confident the team’s talisman will recover in time to play at the tournament in Qatar.,".Sadio Mane, Senegal’s record goalscorer, has been named in the country’s World Cup squad for the Qatar campaign beginning this month, despite suffering an injury to his right fibula earlier this week. .The prolific forward, who has scored 34 times in a Senegal shirt and is widely considered one of the greatest African players of all time, limped off the pitch during his club Bayern Munich’s 6-1 demolition of Werder Bremen on Tuesday. .But coach Aliou Cisse included the team’s talisman when he named his 26-man squad at a news conference in Dakar on Friday, saying he was confident Mane could recover in time to play at the tournament. .He said the Senegal team doctor, Manuel Afonso, flew to Munich to assess the extent of Mane’s injury, and was told he would not require surgery. .Cisse cited the case of Watford attacker Ismaila Sarr, who had been injured going into January’s Africa Cup of Nations finals, but was included in the squad and recovered after the first round to contribute to Senegal’s success in the tournament. .“We will do all in our power to ensure we can recover Mane in time to play,” Cisse added. .While Mane’s fitness will be crucial to Senegal’s hopes, this is not a one-man team. .Cisse kept faith with the majority of the squad that won the Cup of Nations in Cameroon, but did include Monaco defender Ismail Jakobs and Ilimane Ndiaye from Sheffield United, who each have one cap, as well as the uncapped Villarreal forward Nicolas Jackson. .“The players chosen correspond with our vision and philosophy. They are competitors of a high level,” said Cisse, who had his contract as coach extended by a further two years on Thursday. .After Senegal’s opening game of the tournament against the Netherlands on November 21, the Lions of Teranga will also take on hosts Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. .Goalkeepers .Defenders .Midfielders .Forwards",613
614,Published On 11 Nov 2022,"Ronaldo, Bernardo, Bruno in Portugal World Cup squad, but no Jota","A fifth World Cup campaign beckons for Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, but there is no place for injured Liverpool forward Diogo Jota.",".Cristiano Ronaldo will once again pull on the captain’s armband as Portugal head to the World Cup in Qatar. The star forward has been named by head coach Fernando Santos to lead his nation in his fifth World Cup campaign. .The 37-year-old may be showing a few signs of slowing down as his career heads towards its sunset years, and he will not be the only veteran in Santos’s side, with 39-year-old central defender Pepe also named in the squad. .They will be joined by Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes and Joao Felix. .But Joao Moutinho, José Fonte and Renato Sanches have all been left out of the 26-man squad getting on the plane. There was heartbreak, too, for Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, who has been ruled out of a Qatar run due to injury. .“What can Portugal really achieve?” Santos asked reporters gathered in Cidade do Futebol in Oeiras. “I will answer in a very simple way – and that is to be world champions. I believe that is possible, my players also believe in it, and therefore that is what this team can achieve.” .It is not that all experienced players are making the journey to Qatar – 19-year-old Benfica defender Antonio Silva has received his first call-up and will be closely watched by club talent scouts from around the world. .Portugal earned their first major international trophy at the 2016 European Championship, and also won the inaugural Nations League at home in 2019. But the team failed to get past the round of 16 at the 2018 World Cup and then fell on the same stage in Euro 2020. .Santos defended his selection choices for the Qatar 2022 campaign, hoping either to shoulder the blame for failure, or bask in the glory of victory. “I do all the choosing in this case so, naturally, I assume all responsibilities,” he said. “If all goes well, I’m responsible. If not, which will not be the case, I will also be responsible.” .Goalkeepers .Defenders .Midfielders .Forwards",614
615,Published On 11 Nov 2022,FIFA rejects Denmark’s request for pro-human rights training shirts,,".FIFA has rejected a request made by the Danish football federation (DBU) to wear pro-human rights training shirts at the World Cup in Qatar. .The DBU’s director Jakob Jensen told Danish news agency Ritzau that the international football governing body rejected the request because it does not permit political messages on shirts. .The proposed training kit would have contained the text “human rights for all”. .“We don’t think there’s any politics in it. We think that the human rights are universal, and we stand by this view,” Jensen said on Thursday. .“FIFA has a different assessment, and sadly we had to take that into consideration”. .The decision comes a week after FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Secretary-General Fatma Samoura sent a letter to all 32 World Cup teams urging them to “focus on the football” in Qatar and not let the sport “be dragged into every ideological battle that exists”. .The letter was a response to the protests made by several World Cup teams over the treatment of migrant workers and human rights in Qatar. .Denmark had earlier announced a “toned-down” kit ahead of the World Cup with a third all-black kit which it said represented the “colour of mourning”. .The Danish manufacturer Hummel issued a statement which said it did not wish “to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of people their lives”. . .Hummel received criticism after the announcement for manufacturing about a third of its apparel in China, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh, where human rights and labour laws have been called into question. .Qatar’s World Cup organising committee had previously responded to Denmark’s World Cup kit, saying Qatar had used the tournament “as a catalyst to drive change” and had reformed its migrant worker laws. .Jensen said that despite FIFA’s rejection of the proposed training kit, the DBU would continue its efforts to raise concerns. .Jensen said he had travelled to Qatar three times in the last 10 months, where he had met migrant workers who had told him that the dialogue they had conducted “makes a difference”.",615
616,Published On 11 Nov 2022,Can Netherlands exceed restrained expectations at World Cup 2022?,There is cautious optimism around this Dutch team after a string of impressive performances in the Nations League.,".Previous World Cup appearances: 10
Titles: 0
Best finish: Runners-up (1974, 1978, 2010)
World Cup record: W27 D12 L11
Goals: 86
Biggest win: 5-0 vs South Korea (1988)
Player to watch: Virgil van Dijk
Ranking: 8
Fixtures: Senegal (November 21), Ecuador (November 25), Qatar (November 29) .As the Netherlands head to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, expectations amongst fans are more restrained than in previous tournaments. .The current Oranje squad is not as star-studded as previous generations and exited the European Championships last year with a 2-0 loss to the Czech Republic in the round of 16. .Since then, the Netherlands have notched up a string of impressive results against formidable opposition, including two wins over neighbours Belgium in the Nations League to top their group. .A favourable draw with Qatar, Senegal and Ecuador in the World Cup group stages has further buoyed spirits. .The nation also appears behind manager Louis Van Gaal who led them to the World Cup 2014 final after it was revealed he was receiving treatment for prostate cancer. .The Netherlands has produced many great teams in its history but ultimately underachieved on the international stage, failing to win the World Cup despite reaching three finals. .It was in 1974 that the Netherlands, captained by Johan Cruyff, reached their first final utilising their style of “Total Football” – where outfield players can change position while retaining organisational structure. The team stormed the knockout phases, swatting aside Argentina, East Germany and Brazil, but eventually lost the final to West Germany. .Four years later, they would fall short in the final once again as Argentina scored two goals in extra time to win. .The 1980s would see a decline in Dutch football at both club and international levels, with the national side failing to qualify for a World Cup. However, the team, inspired by Marco Van Basten, would win the 1988 European Championships. .In the 1990s, a new generation of Dutch stars that included Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf and Dennis Bergkamp jettisoned the Netherlands to a series of impressive but ultimately disappointing World Cup campaigns. .In 2010, the Netherlands would take Spain to extra time in a feisty final but an extra-time winner from Andres Iniesta sealed the win for the Spaniards. .Four years later, a tactically astute Dutch team oscillated between free-scoring attacking tactics that resulted in Robin Van Persie’s famous lobbed header in a 5-1 rout of Spain and careful defensive displays that saw them eke out two goalless draws resulted in a third-place finish. .The Netherlands would fail to qualify in 2018 after finishing third in their qualifying group to France and Sweden. .The most heated discussions around team selection have focused on who should start in goal. .Manager Van Gaal dropped regular keeper Jasper Cillessen who moved to Dutch club NEC from Valencia, for two Nations League fixtures. .Cillessen’s attitude has also been called into question by former teammate Rafael van der Vaart who described him as a “nasty man”. .In a surprise move, van Gaal handed veteran keeper Remko Pasveer his first senior cap at the age of 38 in September. However, the Ajax shot-stopper has seen a drop in form at the club level in recent weeks. .Feyenoord’s goalkeeper, Justin Bijlow, is also in contention, but the 24-year-old has also suffered a drop in form. .The Oranje boast a robust, star-studded defensive line with the likes of Liverpool FC’s Virgil van Dijk and Manchester City’s Nathan Aké. Van Gaal has dropped Bayern Munich’s Matthijs de Ligt in favour of the more agile Jurriën Timber. .Van Gaal has experimented with his midfield in recent matches, but several players are guaranteed to start, including the versatile Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and former Manchester United defensive midfielder Daley Blind. .Up front, Ajax’s Steven Bergjwin and FC Barcelona’s Memphis Depay will likely start if fit.",616
617,Published On 11 Nov 2022,Meet the referees taking charge of World Cup 2022,History will be made this year as six female match officials travel to a World Cup for the first time in its history.,".The role of a match official at a World Cup is often a thankless job. .While players are heaped with praise when they do outstanding work, referees are rarely hailed for doing their job well. Instead, they are routinely lambasted – by players, managers and fans over the slightest of errors. .The reality is that the high-stakes role requires a comprehensive knowledge of the game’s rules, an elite fitness level – often requiring them to run more than outfield players – and years of hard work. .For World Cup 2022, FIFA has released a list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees and 24 video match officials overseeing the video assistant referee (VAR) system.This will be the first World Cup with female match officials – referees Stéphanie Frappart (France), Salima Mukansanga (Rwanda) and Yoshimi Yamashita  (Japan); assistant referees Neuza Back (Brazil), Karen Díaz Medina (Mexico) and Kathryn Nesbitt (US). .The 2022 World Cup in Qatar will also see the introduction of the new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Semi-Automated Offside Technology. The system currently being trialled in the UEFA Champions League group stages is designed to improve the accuracy of offside decisions. Cameras installed under the roof of the stadium track all 22 players recording data points and calculating their exact position on the pitch. .Referees will also utilise goal-line technology, introduced during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The system uses 14 high-speed cameras to create a 3D image animation that can notify the referee immediately if the ball has crossed the line. .Abdulrahman al-Jassim (Qatar) – The 35-year-old Qatari has been a FIFA referee since 2013 and has officiated several high-profile fixtures. He worked as a VAR official at Russia 2018. He has also refereed at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup and the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup final between Liverpool and Clube de Regatas do Flamengo. .Chris Beath (Australia) – Like al-Jassim, Beath made a name for himself on the international stage by refereeing at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. .Alireza Faghani (Iran) – Hailing from Kashmar in northeast Iran, Faghani played football in the country’s third tier before eventually moving into refereeing. He refereed the 2014 AFC Champions League final, the 2018 World Cup and now plies his trade in Australia’s A-League. . .Ma Ning (China) – Ma Ning is only the second Chinese referee to participate in the World Cup. .Mohammed Abdulla Mohamed (UAE) – The Emirati has been a FIFA referee since 2010 and has refereed at the AFC Asian Cup. .Yoshimi Yamashita (Japan) – In April 2022, Yamashita became the first female official to oversee an AFC Champions League match in which she issued three yellow cards to Melbourne City. .Bakary Papa Gassama (Gambia) – This will be Gassama’s third World Cup appearance after Brazil 2018 and Russia 2018. .Mustapha Ghorbal (Algeria) – The 37-year-old Algerian has refereed several international matches, including the 2020 CAF Champions League final between Egyptian sides Zamalek and Al Ahly, in which he issued two red cards and five yellow cards. .Victor Gomes (South Africa) – A tough-talking no-nonsense referee, Gomes has made headlines on more than one occasion. In 2018, he reportedly turned down a $30,000 bribe to fix a CAF Confederation Cup game between Nigeria’s Plateau United and Algeria’s USM Alger. In the 2021 AFCON final, Gomes sternly told Egyptian superstar Mohammed Salah to stop complaining before sarcastically offering him his whistle. .Salima Mukansanga (Rwanda) – Mukansanga is continuously making history. She is the first woman from her native Rwanda to referee the FIFA Women’s World Cup, the first woman to ever officiate at the African Cup of Nations and now one of the first women to referee at the men’s World Cup. .Janny Sikazwe (Zambia) – Sikazwe boasts an impressive CV, having refereed the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup final and the 2017 AFCON final and becoming the first Zambian referee to officiate a World Cup in 2018. .However, he is perhaps best remembered for incorrectly calling full-time in the 85th and 89th minute in an AFCON clash between Tunisia and Mali in January this year. It later emerged that he had suffered heat stroke and was later taken to hospital. .Maguette Ndiaye (Senegal) – The Senegalese referee officiated several matches at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. .Ivan Barton (Salvador) – Iván Barton, aged 30, has officiated at the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, overseeing the semi-final between Jamaica and the United States and the CONCACAF Nations League. .Ismail Elfath (United States) – Born in Morocco, Elfath came to the US when he was 18 years of age after winning a visa lottery. He made his MLS refeering debut in 2011 and since then has become one of the country’s most respected officials, picking up the MLS Referee of the Year award twice in the past three years. He has officiated at several international tournaments, including the semi-final of the 2019 Club World Cup. . .Mario Escobar (Guatemala) – The 36 year old has been a FIFA-listed referee since 2013 and officiated several CONCACAF tournaments. .Said Martinez (Honduras) – At 31 years of age, Said is one of three referees from Central America to officiate at the 2022 World Cup. Said, who also has a degree in Mathematics, refereed the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup final between the United States and Mexico, issuing three yellow cards in extra time. .César Ramos (Mexico) – The 38-year-old Mexican has been a FIFA-listed referee since 2014. He officiated three matches at the 2018 World Cup, including a group stage 1-1 draw between Brazil and Switzerland. During the game, the Brazil players expressed their displeasure with Ramos after he dismissed claims of fouls on two occasions and ruled out any VAR review. .Raphael Claus (Brazil) – The experienced Brazilian most recently refereed at the 2021 Copa América. .Andres Matias Matonte Cabrera (Uruguay) – The Uruguayan most recently officiated at the Arab Cup in 2021. He oversaw Qatar’s 5-0 quarter-final win over UAE, in which he issued two penalties within eight minutes of each other. .Kevin Ortega (Peru) – At 30, the Peruvian referee is one of the youngest on the plane to Qatar. He has officiated several high-pressure matches, including a semi-final in the 2020 Summer Olympics between Spain and Japan. .Fernando Rapallini (Argentina) – The Argentine boasts a wealth of experience officiating in the Argentinian Primera División and international tournaments. Rapallini made history in 2021 when he became the first South American referee to officiate at a European Championship. .Wilton Sampaio (Brazil) – The 40-year-old has been FIFA-listed since 2013 and most recently officiated at the 2021 Copa América. .Facundo Tello (Argentina) – Tello made a name for himself in Argentina after being selected to referee in the country’s first division after only four matches in the second tier. In 2021, he travelled to Qatar to officiate in the 2021 FIFA Arab World Cup. .Jesus Valenzuela (Venezuela) – The 38 year old was first listed as a FIFA referee in 2013. In July 2021, he officiated the infamous semi-final between Colombia and Argentina in the Copa América, in which Valenzuela dished out 10 yellow cards. . .Matthew Conger (New Zealand) – Since Australia joined the AFC in 2006, Conger is the only referee representing the OFC at the 2022 World Cup. Originally from Texas, in the US, the part-time teacher refereed one group stage match in the 2018 World Cup. .Istvan Kovacs (Romania) – The veteran goalkeeper is set to officiate at his first World Cup this year, having impressed in recent matches, including the Manchester City versus Real Madrid thriller earlier this year in the Champions League. Kovacs played a smart advantage allowing Bernado Silva to rifle home a shot after Toni Kroos fouled Oleksandr Zinchenko in the build-up. .Stephanie Frappart (France) – Frappart plies her trade in France’s Ligue 1 but has notched several high-profile international appearances recently, including the 2019 UEFA Super Cup between Liverpool and Chelsea. In 2020, she became the first woman to referee a Champions League match. In 2022, she officiated the 2022 Coupe de France final between Nice and Nantes. . .Danny Makkelie (The Netherlands) – The experienced Dutch referee and part-time policeman has long officiated high-profile matches, including the 2018 Europa League final. The four matches he refereed during last year’s European Championships made him a household name. In the semi-final between Denmark and England at Wembley, Makkelie awarded a controversial penalty to England that allowed them to progress to the final. .Szymon Marciniak (Poland) – The 41-year-old Polish referee comes with bags of experience, having notched up three games at the 2016 European Championships and two at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. .Antonio Mateu Lahoz(Spain) – The Spaniard is known for his unorthodox chatty approach to officiating but is highly rated by UEFA, who entrusted him with officiating the 2021 Champions League final. In the 2020 European Championships, Mateu oversaw a fractious 2-2 draw between France and Portugal in the group stages, in which he awarded three penalties and four yellow cards. .Michael Oliver (England) – The English referee comes with plenty of domestic experience, officiating high-profile games, such as the 2021 FA Cup final. Oliver has also become a regular in the Champions League, where he is perhaps best remembered for awarding a penalty to Real Madrid that ultimately led to their progression at the expense of Juventus. The decision sparked the usually calm and collected Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon to accuse Oliver of having a “trash can” for a heart. .Daniele Orsato (Italy) – A mainstay of the Champions League, Orsato has refereed both 2020 Champions League final between Bayern Munich and PSG. He also worked as a VAR referee during the 2018 World Cup. .Daniel Siebert (Germany) – He officiated three matches at the 2020 European Championships and was the referee for the 2021 Arab Cup final between Tunisia and Algeria. .Anthony Taylor (England) – The 44-year-old referee has recently been entrusted with fixtures such as the Nations League final between France and Spain. He refereed Denmark versus Finland match in the 2020 European Championships where Christain Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch. Taylor was praised for spotting the situation quickly and swiftly organising medical treatment. .Clement Turpin (France) – Turpin has officiated at the 2016 and 2020 European Championships and the 2018 World Cup. In the 2021-22 season, he officiated nine matches in the UEFA Champions League, including the final. .Slavko Vincic (Slovenia) – Vincic, a qualified telecommunications engineer, was encouraged to try refereeing by his uncle when he was 20 years old. Eleven years later, he was listed as a FIFA referee. He officiated three matches in the 2020 European Championships. He was the referee for this year’s Europa League final between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers. .In 2020 Vincic made headlines after being arrested in connection with a police probe into a prostitution and drugs ring operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

And they will have plenty of support given they are playing so close to home and in a country they share a border with. .After dominating regional football and winning the Asian Cup twice in the 1980s, Saudi Arabia finally qualified for their first World Cup in 1994 with an all-star team. Led by legendary forward Majed Abdullah, the team had players such as Said al-Owairan, Sami al-Jaber, Fahad al-Bishi and record-breaking goalkeeper Mohamed al-Deayea. .After losing their opening match to the Netherlands despite a solid display, Saudi Arabia started strongly against Morocco and sealed their first World Cup points with a 2-1 win. Their final game and chance to qualify for the round-of-16 came against Belgium, who were yet to concede a goal or lose a match in the 1994 tournament. .Five minutes into the match, al-Owairan scored arguably the most famous goal in Saudi history. The attacking midfielder started his run from well within his own half and befuddled five Belgians on his way to the goal, where he coolly slotted past the goalkeeper to write his name into the history books. .The Saudis held on for the next 85 minutes and made their way into the round-of-16. .Once out of the group stages, they met the mighty Swedes who took an early lead and did not allow the Saudis to press forward. Sweden won 3-1 but the Saudis won hearts of their supporters back home and of those who had turned out at the Cotton Bowl stadium in Texas. .Their golden run continued as they qualified for the next three World Cups, with a new crop of players, but could not replicate their 1994 performance and failed to win a single game. The 2002 tournament brought the ignominy of their biggest World Cup defeat, 8-0 at the hands of Germany. .The Green Falcons underwent frequent coaching changes during the 2010s and failed to qualify for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. They finally qualified for the 2018 tournament, and although they failed to progress, they earned a 2-1 win over neighbours Egypt. .The current crop of Saudi players is relatively young, with an average age of just 23. .French coach Herve Renard, who led Zambia and Ivory Coast to African Cup of Nations titles in 2012 and 2015 respectively, took charge of Saudi Arabia in 2019 and has overseen their qualification for this World Cup. .The Frenchman has mixed things up in the squad since taking over, and has introduced several fresh faces picked from the under-23 squad, with Firas al-Buraikan making his senior team debut at the age of 19. .Al-Buraikan has already scored 11 goals and has now become a permanent fixture in the Saudi attack, with promising runs down the flank suiting coach Renard’s attack-from-the-wings gameplan in his preferred 4-3-2-1 formation. .Captain Salman al-Faraj, meanwhile, is key to the Saudi midfield. From helping out in the attack with his accurate passing, to keeping the opponent’s attacks in check, al-Faraj will hope his leadership can bring results. .Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman recently met the team and told them not to worry about the results, and instead to enjoy the tournament. .“I don’t want any of you to be under psychological pressure that will affect your spontaneous performance,” he told the players. .However, fans of the Green Falcons still have high hopes. .They will be the third-largest fan contingent at the World Cup, according to ticket sales figures, and are expected to descend upon Qatar in their thousands. .Although a first-round exit would be an expected result, it is unlikely their fans would accept it as wholeheartedly as their crown prince.",618

620,Published On 10 Nov 2022,FIFA announces Tel Aviv-Doha charter flights for Qatar World Cup,Qatar says flight arrangement adheres to FIFA’s hosting rules but insists its stance on normalising ties with Israel remains unchanged.,".FIFA announced on Thursday the operation of direct charter flights between Tel Aviv and Doha during the upcoming football World Cup, with Qatar stressing that its stance on normalising relations with Israel, with whom it does not have diplomatic relations, remains unchanged. .Football’s world governing body said it brokered the deal that would allow those who hold game tickets and valid Hayya fan ID cards to board flights from Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv to Doha’s Hamad International Airport during the month-long event. .The Hayya ID card is a personalised identification document that is issued and required by every person attending any matches. At least 8,000 Palestinians and 3,900 Israelis have applied for a Hayya card, a source familiar with the agreement told Reuters. .Federation President Gianni Infantino said that the agreement allows Israeli and Palestinian fans to visit Qatar and attend matches during the World Cup. .“With this deal, Israelis and Palestinians will be able to fly together and enjoy football together,” Infantino said in a statement. .FIFA however, did not share specific details about how Palestinians will be able to avail the flights, as Israel severely restricts access to Ben Gurion for residents of the occupied Palestinian territories. Palestinians in occupied West Bank normally travel through Jordan and it is virtually impossible for Gazans to enter the Ben Gurion airport. .A spokesperson for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 said that ever since Doha won the rights to host the global event, it has stressed that all ticket holders will be able to attend the matches in the country. The spokesperson also said that this announcement reflected Qatar’s commitment to respecting FIFA’s policies and hosting requirements. .The agreement on direct flights does not change Qatar’s stance on normalising relations with Israel, which is linked to Palestinian statehood that is achieved through a two-state solution in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, a Qatari official said. .“Because of this agreement, Palestinians will now be able to enjoy the first World Cup in the Arab and Muslim world,” the official said. .The official pointed out that Qatar has not witnessed any positive developments in the peace process that merit a change in its current policy, stressing that the flight arrangements depended on Israel’s commitment to non-escalation in the Palestinian territories. .Israeli passport holders can usually only travel to Qatar on special visas issued for sports fixtures or conferences. There are no existing direct flights between the two countries. .“This is great news for football fans and for all Israelis. After hard work over the course of many months, we have arranged for Israeli citizens to be able to fly to the World Cup in Qatar on direct flights, and the opening of an Israeli office in Qatar to provide services to fans coming for the World Cup,” said Israel’s outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid. .FIFA confirmed that consular services for Israeli citizens will be provided in coordination with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a designated privately-operated international travel company based in Doha. Palestinians will have access to consular services at the Palestinian embassy in Doha. .The flight arrangement is “subject to Israel’s security requirements and operational capabilities”, FIFA said in a statement. .Qatar’s Gulf neighbours the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established diplomatic ties with Israel under US-brokered pacts in 2020.",620

At that tournament, Japan recorded wins over Denmark and Cameroon in between a 1-0 loss to eventual runners-up Netherlands. .“It’s not going to be an easy path [out of the group],” Japan Times sports writer Dan Orlowitz told Al Jazeera. “Everyone agrees that a win against Costa Rica and then at least a draw with either Germany or Spain is the most realistic way forward. Those results won’t come easy but they’re not impossible if the team plays at its best.” .Japan currently have several players playing in Europe. The squad, which, on paper, is as good as it has ever been when it comes to technical qualities. .But they have lacked leadership and calmness on the field without the presence of former players Keisuke Honda and Shinji Kagawa in attack. .This was shown in their World Cup qualification campaign as they were held to a draw at home by Vietnam. In June, they lost 3-0 to Tunisia in Osaka. .Moriyasu’s side did follow up strongly with convincing wins over South Korea and the United States but they will have to be more clinical in the World Cup if they want to advance to the knockout phase. .For Orlowitz, players such as Junya Ito, Kaoru Mitoma and Daichi Kamada will have to step up. .“What Honda and Kagawa brought to the team is star power which is missing these days. It is one of the few complicated and intertwined reasons behind the team’s recent drop in popularity. Takefusa Kubo and Takumi Minamino are the faces of the team in that sense but if we are being honest, they’ve yet to really perform when it matters,” said Orlowitz. .An attacking midfielder by trade, Kamada is the engine of the Japanese team and will arguably be their most important player in the World Cup. .He also brings a winning mentality to the squad, having helped Eintracht Frankfurt win the Europa League in May this year. .Yoichi Tominaga, a Kagoshima resident, who has been a fan of Japanese football for almost 30 years, is not too confident about his country’s chances, though. Tominaga believes that Moriyasu’s tactical decisions are flawed and that this could cost the team. .“I don’t think the team is heading in the right direction under Moriyasu,” Tominga told Al Jazeera. .“Players trust him as he is a good person but he is not a good tactician. If the players could have a tactically minded coach, they could be playing much better than they are now. As an underdog team, we could have a chance to beat great teams like Germany and Spain but we need to be organised. We will never forget the 2018 World Cup where we led Belgium 2-0 before losing 3-2.”",622

Group stage fixtures: Canada (November 23), Morocco (November 27), Croatia (December 1) .Once number one in the rankings for more than three consecutive years, and victors of a box-to-box quarter-final against Brazil at the last World Cup, Belgium and their coach Roberto Martinez travel to Qatar with question marks, knowing that this tournament perhaps represents the last opportunity for the country’s golden generation to leave a mark. .Can Belgium produce one last grand hooray before some of the country’s mainstays retire? Will Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku be fit at all in time for the competition? Does Martinez have what it takes to lead this team on another deep run into a major tournament? .Four years ago, Belgium’s barnstorming football enthralled with victories for the ages against Japan and Brazil to reach the semis and ultimately finish third, their best-ever result. .The achievement was the culmination of Belgium’s revolution in youth development following a disappointing group-stage exit from Euro 2000 on home soil. Belgian coaches focused on the development of individual talent, playing in a 4-3-3 formation. .Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne spearheaded a side that oozed confidence and brilliance. But the 2018 success set new benchmarks and expectations that the Belgians have failed to meet in the past four years. Disappointment followed disappointment as the Belgians crashed out of Euro 2020 in the quarter-finals and then struggled to impress in the Final Four of the Nations League a few months later. .Twice, Belgium and Martinez were beaten by heavyweight opposition: Italy were cool and composed in Munich and France turned around a 2-0 deficit in a helter-skelter second half. .Last summer, the Netherlands under coach Louis Van Gaal handed Belgium another reality check in the Nations League, winning home and away. Over the years, Belgium have become very adept at playing smaller nations, dealing with lesser opposition in a businesslike fashion, but when it really matters against the very best, they often lack a cutting edge. .For Belgium, to defeat the best in the world they need their best players to be in top shape – and a quick glance across the team’s squad suggests that this will be problematic in Qatar. .Hazard has become a fringe figure at Real Madrid, never rekindling his dazzling form from his days in West London with Chelsea. With just weeks until the curtain-raiser against Canada in Group F, Lukaku’s match fitness remains uncertain. He faces a race against time, one that looks difficult to win. .Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and superlative midfielder Kevin De Bruyne could well carry the majority of the burden during Belgium’s World Cup campaign, but they alone cannot manufacture another great result. At the same time, the next generation of Belgian players, including poster boy Charles De Ketelaere who plies his trade for AC Milan in Italy, have been integrated enough to give the team a new elan and fresh look. .Group F promises to be challenging for Belgium, facing Canada who return to the World Cup for the first time since 1986, Morocco, an African powerhouse, and Croatia, runners-up in the last World Cup. .The Belgians should still have enough talent to navigate that group, but whether they can repeat the heroics of four years ago in the knockout phase is doubtful. .In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Martinez expressed his confidence despite the doubts surrounding his team, arguing it had evolved enough to take on the challenge in Qatar. .“There has been an evolution,” he said. “I think we have improved in the competitive nature of having three players for every position. It is becoming harder to reduce our list to 26 players, even in goal. Everyone is growing, developing and progressing in their roles. .“Even in the last game in our qualification campaign, we were able to make a lot of changes and maintain our level and way of playing. I have been here since 2016 and you can start to see that we are working in a way that every player comes in knowing what is expected.”",623

Fixtures: Cameroon (November 24), Brazil (November 28), Serbia (December 2) .Switzerland will be out to cause upsets in Qatar. .Led by Granit Xhaka, the Swiss squad possesses experience and quality in key midfield and defensive positions, but stern tests await in the shape of a strong group featuring serial winners Brazil, as well as Cameroon and Serbia. .Switzerland has featured at 11 World Cups since making its maiden appearance at the 1934 edition. .In recent decades, the Swiss have emerged as tournament regulars, with the side’s appearance in Qatar set to mark a fifth successive World Cup showing. .Switzerland’s equal best-ever World Cup run took place 68 years ago when they played host to the 1954 edition and squeezed their way to the quarter-finals. .Given the competition only featured 16 sides, the side’s position as runners-up in their group – which included England, Italy and Belgium – paved the way for entry to the last-eight. .However, the team proved unable to progress any further, losing a 7-5 thriller – the highest-scoring contest in World Cup history – to neighbouring Austria. .Switzerland had reached the quarter-finals twice before, during the 1934 World Cup in Italy and four years later in France, before losing to then-Czechoslovakia and Hungary at the respective tournaments. .Xhaka, 30, will be critical to Swiss hopes in Qatar. The highly experienced, combative central midfielder has been capped more than 100 times for his country and has displayed excellent form of late for his club side, Arsenal, in the English Premier League. .He has scored three goals and registered as many assists in just 13 league games so far, with his box-to-box play demonstrating his attacking prowess, as well as renowned defensive abilities and attracting widespread plaudits. .Xhaka’s flying start to the season has come after he played an instrumental role in Switzerland’s impressive run to the quarter-finals of the delayed Euro 2020 capped by the team’s penalty shootout victory over much-fancied France in the last-16. .His role in Qatar will be to function as Switzerland’s all-action central cog, linking up play between its defensive marshalls, such as Fabian Schar and Manuel Akanji, and attacking talents including Xherdan Shaqiri and Breel Embolo. .But his notoriously feisty temperament will be under the scanner once again, particularly when the Swiss face up against Serbia on December 2. .Xhaka, who is of Kosovo-Albanian heritage, was fined by FIFA for making an eagle hand gesture four years ago while celebrating scoring in a 2-1 win over the Serbs at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The nationalist gesture symbolises the double-headed eagle on Albania’s national flag. .Switzerland will have a sense of the familiar in Qatar, with two of their group G opponents – Brazil and Serbia – offering a repeat of the side’s 2018 tournament matchups. .Fans will certainly be hoping for a repeat of the results from four years ago when they held Brazil to a 1-1 draw and beat Serbia – as well as a victory against the group underdogs Cameroon this time around. .Switzerland, who are the 15th-best team in the world, according to the latest FIFA rankings, may struggle to progress further than the last-16. .But the team is certainly expected to represent a stubborn obstacle that more highly favoured opponents will do well to hurdle. .If Xhaka can carry his recent domestic form into the tournament, it is not beyond possibility that he could drive Switzerland further than they have ever gone before. .For the more than eight million Swiss who will be cheering the team on, joyous surprises could just be around the corner.",627

Instead, Tunisia relies on intangibles to compensate for a supposed lack of talent on paper. .“Grinta” (Italian for grit) has become the national team’s ethos and it perfectly encapsulates the underdog spirit the Tunisians embody on the pitch. .Historically, they have employed those intangibles to trigger trailblazing accomplishments at the World Cup. For instance, Tunisia made history in 1978 by defeating Mexico 3-1 in the first match of the group stages, becoming the first African or Arab country to win a match at a World Cup. .Unfortunately, subsequent appearances at the tournament failed to live up to those standards that Tarek Dhiab’s golden generation set in Argentina. In fact, of the five African representatives in Qatar, Tunisia are the only ones that have never managed to get past the group stages. .Supporters of the Carthage Eagles, who will be numerous in Qatar, understand that they are, once again, not favoured to qualify for the knockout stages. Notwithstanding, coach Jalel Kadri’s men will not curb their ambition and they will be a tough challenge for Denmark, Austria and France in Group D. .Dating back to 2019, Tunisia has conceded about half a goal per game over a span of more than 50 matches. The team’s strengths are in their disciplined midfield. Aïssa Laïdouni and Ellyes Skhiri anchor the middle of the pitch in holding roles and are more than capable of cleanly distributing possession to more capable attacking players. .Wahbi Khazri, Naim Sliti and Youssef Msakni compose an excellent attacking front line with boatloads of experience. .Msakni, in particular, will feel that Qatar 2022 could be the crowning moment of his career. .After an illustrious club career back home with Esperance de Tunis, he bucked all expectations by refusing a move to Europe in 2013, and preferring to instead make the Qatar Stars League his home. .In the decade since his transfer, the Tunisian maestro has gone on to become one of the best players to ever grace the pitch in Qatar. Prior to the World Cup in 2018, Msakni suffered a debilitating knee injury that ruled him out of the competition. Four years later, his career trajectory has come full circle and “the ferret”, as he is known in Tunisia, seems ready to put a bow on his career by finally helping his nation to the knockout stages. .Yet, if Tunisia’s midfield is a clear strength, there are clear question marks regarding the team’s goalkeeping. Aymen Dahmen, the 25-year-old CS Sfaxien netminder, has done an OK job throughout this calendar year, but Tunisian goalkeepers have been notorious for producing embarrassing mistakes in recent major tournaments, and Dahmen’s inexperience on this stage may unnerve supporters. .Tunisia also lack an out-and-out target man. Khazri has deputised as a striker over the last three years, but the former Sunderland winger does not have the size to challenge centre-halves in the air. .The final and most problematic uncertainty with regard to the Tunisian national team is coach Kadri, who will be one of two coaches in Qatar that have never played a kick of senior football in the first division in any country (Canada’s John Herdman is the other). .Kadri is seen as a limited manager that will accommodate the experienced players in his squad, take instruction from higher-ups in the federation, and ultimately fail to implement the kind of game plans Tunisia would need to upset the European heavyweights in their group.",628

I wonder why the Qatari ambassador is still in Paris???!!!” another user posted. . .Hamad Al-Kawari, a minister of state and the president of Qatar’s National Library, called on France to show a “little sportsmanship”. .“Even caustic satire is welcome!!!” he tweeted in French. “But the Canard Enchaîné decided to resort to lies, hatred and grudges to attack Qatar and denigrate it.” .Last month, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani slammed the “unprecedented campaign” of criticism directed at the country in the lead-up to the World Cup. .“It became clear to us that the campaign continues, expands and includes fabrication and double standards, until it reached a level of ferocity that made many question, unfortunately, the real reasons and motives behind this campaign,” he said, adding that no other host country faced that level of criticism. .Several cities in France, including the capital Paris, will not show the World Cup matches in fan zones, citing concerns over rights violations of migrant workers and the environmental impact of the tournament. .France’s top football team, Paris Saint-Germain, is owned by Nasser Al-Khelaifi, chairman of Qatar Sports Investments and beIN media gGroup. .“We have very constructive relations with the club and its entourage yet it doesn’t prevent us to say when we disagree,” Pierre Rabadan, the deputy mayor of Paris in charge of sports, told French media. .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of football’s 2022 FIFA World Cup. .Earlier this month, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said Qatar has made progress in its labour reforms but challenges in their implementation remain. It said reforms have improved the working and living conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers – estimated to form 85 percent of Qatar’s population – though additional efforts are needed to ensure that all workers can benefit.",629

From 2009 to 2013, he coached Jordan’s national team and led them to the 2011 Asian Cup quarter-finals and the playoff round of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers. .Here, he talks to Al Jazeera about Jordan’s team failing to make the World Cup and gives his predictions on how the Arab teams will perform: .Al Jazeera: What went wrong in Jordan’s qualification process and what are the team’s hopes for World Cup 2026? .Hamad: The team missed a great opportunity, especially given its performance now compared to last year. However, it is about the ongoing good level of play and positive results. We aim to do better after moving up the rankings and achieving positive results against major teams, and gaining a good set of players. This gives us a major motivation to succeed in the future. .Our ambition and goals are clear: Qualify for the World Cup 2026. .This ambition requires work and we are holding continuous meetings and putting together a good plan. But what is important is applying that plan. Everyone must come together and cooperate to reach the goal of qualification. .Al Jazeera: Four Arab teams – Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Morocco – are in this year’s World Cup. How well do you think they will do? .Hamad: First of all, the Qatari team is different than what it was. We are talking about a team that is now Asian champions, and they earned this title. We are talking about a team that has developed greatly and a generation of players that have accomplished great things for Qatari football. .Their ambitions will be big especially based on what we have already seen from their participation in Copa America 2019 and European qualifiers for the World Cup. All this shows that Qatar is capable of a great performance. Qatar’s team has a real opportunity to qualify for the World Cup playoffs. .The Saudi team can also put on a good show, especially with this being its sixth appearance in the World Cup. .Today, Saudi football is clearly well developed, and the team has shown high technical levels in the qualifiers. It has players of high calibre and the local competition strength at league levels is also high, which reflects in the team. .Tunisia is one of the strongest African teams. It has many professional players from major European leagues, which is why there will be high aims for success, especially since they will have great support in the crowd. .The Moroccan team is considered the best Arab team playing in the Qatar World Cup. It has 20 professional players from major European leagues. In the qualifiers, it passed with flying colours and has a major chance of progressing from the group. .I believe that the Moroccan team has the best set of players, and the opportunity is in their hands to be the dark horse of the tournament. .Al Jazeera: Iraq has only participated once in a World Cup. What are your thoughts on their struggles to make the tournament? .Hamad: It is strange for Iraqi football that, despite its rich history and major abilities, it has not qualified for more world cups. I was one of the players in World Cup 1986. We faced major teams in a difficult group. We lost three matches but the losses were not major: We lost by one goal in each match. .At that time, we struggled through a change of coaches, and there wasn’t much interest in the local competitions. .These reasons were enough to not achieve any wins in that tournament. I also believe that the participation was not positive enough, but the team had largely untapped talents. .This story was first published here on aljazeera.net.  .The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.",631
632,Published On 8 Nov 2022,Qatar national football team’s road to World Cup 2022,"The highs, the lows, the wins, the losses and the expectations from the national side.",".Doha, Qatar – Qatar is set to make history on November 20, when it becomes the first country to make its debut at the FIFA World Cup by virtue of being the host. .FIFA announced Qatar as the hosts of the 2022 World Cup in December 2010, news that brought the attention of football fans to the Gulf nation. .Football, however, was officially recognised as a sport in the country long before that. .Qatar Football Association (QFA) was formed in 1960 and it became a FIFA member three years later. After spending the first two decades on the losing end of most international matches, Qatar’s team made its first impact at the Gulf Cup in 1984, when it reached the final which it lost to Iraq on penalties. .The 1990s saw the rise of the Annabi. .In 1992, Qatar won its first-ever Gulf Cup and qualified for the Summer Olympics. .Despite never having qualified for the World Cup before, Qatar came close to making the final cut on a number of occasions. .They were in the race for a spot at the 1990 World Cup but finished third in the final round of qualifiers, and dropped out of the reckoning for France in 1998 after losing their last playoff to Saudi Arabia. .Qatar’s progress at the regional and continental level continued in the 2000s, as they won the gold medal at the Asian Games as hosts. .The Annabi’s biggest honour, however, came in 2019 when they won the Asian Cup for the first time. .Qatar started off the tournament in the UAE with an impressive run in group stages, winning all three games and scoring 10 goals. .They battled past Iraq in the round of 16, edged out South Korea in the quarterfinals and thrashed UAE in the semi-finals. .In the final, star forward Almoez Ali put Qatar ahead early on and a strong defensive unit, led by goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, helped the side seal a 3-1 win. .The goal they conceded in the final was the only one throughout the tournament while scoring 19. .The team returned home to a heroes’ welcome, and raised the fans’ expectations for the World Cup. .The results since the 2019 win have been mixed. Qatar were invited for the 2019 Copa America to provide quality international exposure. .They lost three matches and drew one. .Additionally, Qatar was part of various AFC world cup qualifier groups, as well as the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup 2021, where it reached the semi-finals. .The Annabi reached its highest FIFA ranking of 48 last year following an impressive run at the Gulf Cup where they finished third. .Given its recent rise in international football, Qatar’s fans will be hoping that their team is able to make the most of the host factor and make a push for the knockout stages. .Qatar’s coach Felix Sanchez will rely on the strong defensive unit, led by goalkeeper al-Sheeb, to keep clean sheets. .Ali’s performance will be key to Qatar’s chances in front of goal as he was the team’s leading scorer in its Asian Cup triumph. In addition, winger Akram Afif and captain Hassan al-Haydos form the core of Qatar’s attack. .The Asian Cup-winning coach admits that the quality of opposition at the World Cup will be different from all other tournaments his team has participated in and will not make it easy for them to progress. .“Tough matches await us in the tournament,” Sanchez said in a recent interview. “We will face very strong teams, teams that are used to being in the World Cup.” .Sanchez has underlined the importance of having home support behind the team in its group matches against Ecuador (November 20), Senegal (November 25) and the Netherlands (November 29). .“The fans’ cheers will help Qatar during the World Cup as it will push the players to give their best.”",632

Aston Villa attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho will also be bitterly disappointed after a thigh injury in weekend training will see him sidelined for several weeks. .Brazil will take four centre backs – Juventus’s Bremer, Paris Saint-Germain’s Marquinhos, Chelsea’s Thiago Silva and Real Madrid’s Eder Militao, while leaving out Roger Ibanez of Roma, Lucas Verissimo of Benfica and Gabriel Magalhaes, whose goal at the weekend put Arsenal back at the top of the English Premier League. .The Brazilian FA also announced that former PSG manager Ricardo Gomes will join Tite’s staff as an assistant. .The squad and Tite will gather on November 14 at Juventus’s training facilities in Turin, where Brazil will hold a five-day training camp before flying to Doha on November 19. .Brazil will play in Group G, with Serbia, Switzerland and Cameroon. Serbia and Switzerland also had the misfortune to be in Brazil’s group four years ago in Russia, when the Brazilians lost to Belgium in the quarter-finals. Brazil’s World Cup campaign in Qatar begins against Serbia on November 24. .The 61-year-old Tite, whose childhood mentor Luiz Felipe Scolari led Brazil to their most recent World Cup win 20 years ago, has already announced he will step down after this tournament after six years in charge of Brazil. .Goalkeepers: .Defenders: .Midfielders: .Forwards:",633

It’s arguably the greatest era in Portuguese football and yet, they’ve been abysmal in the intervening World Cups. .Portugal hasn’t made it to the quarter-finals since 2006. .In 2014, they were knocked out in the group stages. Four years later, they were eliminated in the round of 16. .In the past three World Cups, they’ve won just three matches. Ronaldo is yet to score in the knockout stages of a World Cup. .The Seleção das Quinas is the highest-ranked team in their group of South Korea, Uruguay and Ghana and are expected to top it. .The standout fixture will be their match against Uruguay, the team that knocked them out of Russia 2018. .One of the country’s three wins in the past three World Cups came against Ghana, who were in Portugal’s group at Brazil 2014. .A loss to Serbia in their last qualifier consigned Portugal to the playoffs, where they held their nerve against Turkey and then North Macedonia to seal their spot at the World Cup. .They have become specialists in these high-stakes encounters – this is the third consecutive World Cup they have qualified for through the playoffs. .“The best is yet to come, I can’t be more specific than that. The best is yet to come and it will come this year,” said manager Federico Santos after their win over the Czech Republic in September. .At 37, Ronaldo is not the force he once was. .Despite scoring 24 goals for Manchester United last season, Portugal’s record scorer has found himself on the fringes of the squad this year. .While Santos remains unperturbed by Ronaldo’s recent woes and has assured him of a place in his starting lineup, his inclusion is a massive point of contention among Portuguese fans. .Ronaldo has scored five goals in his last 10 appearances for Portugal. All five goals came in two games. .As is the case at United, the debate over Ronaldo is that in accommodating him in the XI, the team loses its balance. Moreover, with players like Bernado Silva, João Félix, Rafael Leão and Bruno Fernandes, Portugal has no shortage of attacking options. .Not for the first time, Portugal’s fate at the World Cup is closely tied to Ronaldo.

I’m emotionally invested in them, and I want them to win the trophy. I have tickets to all three group matches and possibly a quarter-final to watch them.” .Roger David, a Cameroonian teacher, said: “Argentina has my support because of Lionel Messi, who is the best in the world and deserves it. He has accomplished everything in club football, so now is his chance to shine and win the grand prize.” .“Fans are emotional, and they look for happiness in football through Messi,” said Ismail Ali, a Pakistani fan. “He has brought many joy and memorable moments to the world, so this is his World Cup to win for the entire world.” .Jessica Costa, a Qatar University student from Argentina, described her pride at the fans’ carnival. .“It’s amazing to see people from other countries wearing your country’s jersey,” she said. “I am proud to see them celebrate Argentina with such joy, cheering for our team.” .According to Lucas Aurieme, an Argentinian resident of Qatar, it was “strange but cool” to see other nationals celebrating and rooting for his country. .Argentina “moves that sentiment of people all over the world”, he said, adding that he felt “elated” while riding the metro to the event and seeing many fans dressed in Argentina’s colours. .“Many people have asked us for selfies just because we’re from Argentina.

After a loss to Brazil and a draw against Croatia, the Socceroos qualified for the round of 16, where they were narrowly beaten 1-0 by the tournament’s eventual winner, Italy. .Australia would qualify for the next three tournaments but fail to make it past the group stage.

However, redemption came for the Sydney-born manager as Australia qualified for their sixth World Cup via an impressive qualification campaign which saw them beat UAE and Peru in the playoffs. .This Australian team may lack household names in its World Cup squad, but they bring an exciting balance of experienced and young talent. .In goal, Australia can rely on the steady hands of Mathew Ryan, the former Brighton and Hove goalkeeper who currently plies his trade at Danish side FC Copenhagen. .In defence, Trent Sainsbury is a shoo-in for the centre-back position. The journeyman defender, who currently plays for Al-Wakrah in Qatar, made a name for himself in the Dutch Eredivisie and has been capped more than 50 times for his country. .It is in midfield that Arnold will need to make some hard decisions with several players competing for similar positions. Aaron Mooy has impressed in performances for Celtic this season in the number 8 role, where his creativity and sharp passing have resulted in several assists. .Mooy was to be joined by Ajdin Hrustic, but he is now a doubt for the tournament due to injury. .Up front, the pacey Mathew Leckie will most likely be deployed on the wings. The 31-year-old recently returned to Melbourne City after a decade in Germany. .Leckie may be joined up front by Garang Kuol, an 18-year-old wonderkid who came to Australia with his Sudanese family from Egypt as a refugee and recently signed for Newcastle United.",638

With the world watching, Qatar is determined to put on a show. .Dozens of hotel and leisure complexes have been built in the 12 years since Qatar was awarded hosting rights for the 2022 World Cup. New entertainment venues, beaches, resorts, museums, and restaurants – it is all part of the package. .There are no fewer than three music festivals running concurrently while the World Cup is on. Fans will get to enjoy acts including Black Eyed Peas and Armin van Buuren. .Enrique Iglesias played at Doha Golf Club on Friday, with the same venue expected to host Black Eyed Peas. .The Arcadia Festival, with three iconic stages, will attract more than 100 international artists and run from November 19 to December 19, a day after the World Cup final. .The event includes a fire-breathing 50-tonne Spider and a laser-heavy Reactor stage set. Daydream Festival, meanwhile, is taking over the famous Doha Golf Club hosting electronic acts, including Tiesto, Alesso, ATB and Paul van Dyk. . .Qatar’s iconic Museum of Islamic Art reopened to the public last month. Among the wave of new openings for visitors in 2022 was the 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum. .More than 1.2 million fans are expected to travel to Qatar to watch the World Cup. Almost 2.9 million tickets have been sold. .Apartments, hotel rooms, desert camps, villas, fan villages and even cabins on moored cruise ships have been made available for fans coming to Qatar. Some fans will opt to stay in the UAE, Oman and Iran, flying in on “shuttle” flights to watch the football before heading back without having to spend the night in Qatar. .The country has reported an influx in international arrivals which is currently at a five-year high, with 151,000 visitors turning up in September alone. Arrivals from other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations made up 44 percent of total international arrivals, led by Saudi Arabia which accounted for nearly 30 percent of total figures, according to the Qatar Tourism Authority. .Qatar 2022, host organisers, said “Qatar will host a vast array of cultural and entertainment options for the whole family” during the World Cup. .“The countrywide festival will include more than 90 special events set to take place on the sidelines of the tournament … the major events will feature match viewing areas, music festivals, cultural displays and street performances,” it said. .In the capital, Doha, the Corniche has been pedestrianised since the start of November, and the 6km (3.7 miles) stretch of road by the water “will have a carnival atmosphere featuring roving performances, cultural activities, food and beverage stalls, and retail outlets”. .Keeping the numbers in mind, Qatar is expected to deploy tens of thousands of security forces to ensure a seamless World Cup. .The host country has signed numerous security cooperation deals with several countries, including Morocco, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Turkey and NATO. .",639

Their historic appearance was marred by three defeats in the group stages to France, Hungary and the then-Soviet Union. .Participation in the 1986 competition marked the high point for Canadian football that would remain unmatched for several decades, until now. .But it also proved a chastening experience for the players, with the side unable to score a single goal and conceding five across 270 minutes of action. .They were one of only two teams at the tournament not to score a single point, alongside Iraq, who enjoyed a superior goal difference to the Canadians. .Canada will hope to recapture their qualifying form when they begin their World Cup adventure on November 23 against Belgium. .The side topped the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) qualifying group, winning eight of their 14 games and recording shock victories against the higher-ranked United States and Mexico. .Canadians will be looking to the prodigiously talented Alphonso Davies, 22, for inspiration in Qatar. .Typically deployed as a left wing-back for his club side, German giants Bayern Munich, Davies is renowned for his blistering pace, dribbling and shooting. .For Canada, he often plays further forward, allowing him to occupy spaces behind prolific frontman Jonathan David and giving him greater opportunity to dictate attacks. .Already widely regarded as the finest player in the CONCACAF grouping of countries, Davies will now have the opportunity to demonstrate his talent on the global stage. .His career to date has been decorated with an array of trophies, including four Bundesliga titles, several domestic cups, a UEFA Champions League winners medal and a FIFA Club World Cup triumph. .Despite the excitement building around Davies and David, also 22, the Canadians are not anticipated to make it out of Group F given the quality of Croatia and Belgium. .But manager John Herman has called on his players to relish the experience of playing in the tournament and urged them to push themselves to their limits against the likes of Croatian star Luka Modric and Belgium’s array of world-class performers. .He has said the team has an opportunity to create a “generational shift” in Canada – where football has often been crowded out by ice hockey and other more popular sports – and “create memories that will last forever” for the country’s 38 million people. .While a run to the knockout phase is unlikely, a competitive showing in the group stage would still herald significant progress for Canadian football as the country prepares to host the 2026 World Cup, alongside the US and Mexico. .For Davies and David, this year’s tournament will provide a platform from which they can potentially launch their already well-established careers to even greater heights yet.",640

When the World Cup returned to Europe after eight years, England was selected to host the tournament for the first time. .Drug testing was introduced. The tournament was spread across seven towns and eight stadiums. .Wembley Stadium in London, with a capacity of nearly 100,000 people, hosted the most matches (nine), including the final and all of England’s games. .African countries boycotted the tournament after their demand for a guaranteed spot in the main draw wasn’t met. .European teams made up more than half of the main draw. They were joined by squads from the Americas and North Korea, which was the only Asian representative. .England opened the tournament with a dull draw against Uruguay, but both teams made it into the knockouts. Other European teams and Argentina also advanced, and North Korea sprang a surprise by qualifying for the quarterfinals after beating Italy. .Portugal seemed strong contenders for the title with their high-scoring results largely helped by striker Eusebio’s nine goals in the tournament. He propelled Portugal into the semis, where they narrowly lost to England. .The England-West Germany final, played in a packed Wembley Stadium, turned out to be a classic. .England were about to record their first world title, but the Germans equalised in the last minute. .Geoff Hurst, who made England’s first goal, scored what has remained one the most controversial goals in a World Cup final. His shot hit the crossbar and bounced on the goal line, and a goal was awarded to England, setting off a decades-long debate. .Hurst completed his hat-trick, the only player to score one in a World Cup final, at the end of extra time and in the middle of a pitch invasion. .This was the first World Cup to be broadcast via satellite.

No team from Asia has played in as many world cups as the Taeguk Warriors. .The watershed moment for South Korean football came in 2002 when the national team made it to the semi-finals on home soil. That Guus Hiddink side taught a nation to dream, and since then, South Korea have entered every World Cup with the hopes of millions pinned on the team. .Past World Cup performances
Since 2002, South Korea have only made it past the group stages once in four attempts and have won just three of its past 13 World Cup matches. One of them was in 2018 in Russia, where they famously defeated defending champions Germany 2-0 and knocked them out of the tournament. .Their only appearance in the round of 16 in the past 10 years came in 2010 when they were defeated by Uruguay, their opponents in their opening game of this year’s World Cup. .Who’s in their group?
Along with Uruguay, South Korea find themselves in a tough group, which also features Portugal and Ghana. .“Objectively speaking, it will be tough for us to make it to the round of 16,” former South Korea captain Park Ji-sung said at a World Cup trophy showcase event in Seoul in August. .While expectations may be low, hopes are still high. Park said that few had expected South Korea to make it to the semi-finals in 2002 and added that “with the support of our fans here, I think a trip to the round of 16 is possible”. .Qualification and recent form
When manager Paulo Bento took charge of the side in August 2018, South Korea were ranked 57th in the world. Four years on, the Taeguk Warriors enter this year’s World Cup ranked 28th, the highest they’ve been since 2012. .In this period, South Korea retained the Asian Games in 2018, registered wins over high-calibre teams like Colombia, Egypt and Chile, and sailed through qualification for the upcoming World Cup, losing just once in 17 games. .Player to look out for
Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min is the face of South Korean football. Last season’s Premier League Golden Boot winner was the highest scorer for the team in the World Cup qualifiers with seven goals. While Son has struggled with his form with Tottenham this season, he enters the World Cup having scored four goals in his past six international appearances. .Son is currently level with Park for the most goals scored by a South Korean in a World Cup, and Park expects him to break the record in Qatar. .Son “scored once at his first World Cup [in 2014] and then had two goals at his second World Cup”, Park said. “Since this will be his third appearance, I think he will net three goals and give us a lot to cheer about. And obviously, the record will be his.” .But Son’s participation currently hangs in the balance. Tottenham confirmed that the forward will be undergoing surgery after suffering a fracture under his left eye in their Champions League game against Marseille at the start of the month. While the club hasn’t provided a timeline for his return, it will be a race against time for Son to make it on the plane to Qatar.",643
644,Published On 5 Nov 2022,The 10 football World Cup heroes,"Ahead of Qatar 2022, here is a list of 10 biggest players to have played the World Cup.",".Football is a great leveller. Not everyone goes to a school with a rugby pitch and not everyone can afford a pony. .However, from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro to the slums of Nairobi to the playgrounds of Monaco and Beverly Hills, you will see children kicking a football about. .Perhaps the way in which football stars have often escaped humble origins to shine in a sport that allows the very best to become icons on and off the pitch and truly become heroes of nations. .Arguments over the greatest 10 World Cup heroes have kept friends debating into the small hours for decades. .Such arguments will continue for as long as football is played. But here, ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, are 10 we think have been the best: .One of the greatest, and most controversial, players of the game, Zidane won the 1998 World Cup for France at home, scoring twice in the final. .Injuries kept him largely out of France’s short-lived 2002 World Cup campaign, but he went on to be named player of the tournament at the 2006 edition – despite the infamous head butt that sent him off in the final. Thousands of fans lined the streets of Paris chanting Zidane’s name when the team returned home. .Having scored 31 goals in 108 matches for France, his talismanic leadership shaped the national team into something much greater than the sum of its parts. .As a coach, he went on to win three Champions League titles and La Liga twice with Real Madrid. .Not even the great Bobby Moore – whose statue greets supporters arriving at Wembley Stadium – was as loved by the everyday English fans as Jimmy Greaves. .Already a star at home, Greaves gained international recognition after rescuing a pitch-invading dog that had evaded the Brazilian greats during England’s 1962 World Cup quarter-final. Brazil’s Garrincha took the dog home and Greaves became known in Brazil as “Garrincha’s dog-catcher”. .Greaves was part of the 1966 World Cup-winning squad, but a savage injury inflicted by France’s Joseph Bonnel that required 14 stitches kept Greaves out of the final. .Greaves scored six hat-tricks in an England shirt, a record that still stands. .The 1966 campaign continues to be a focal point of English identity, the squad universally adored, and Greaves became a broadcaster, welcomed into the nation’s living rooms for decades. .Greaves was eventually awarded a World Cup winners’ medal by Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2009. .Puskas was captain of the Mighty Magyars, Hungary’s golden team, which flourished under the influence of Jimmy Hogan’s Total Football. .He scored 84 goals in 85 matches for Hungary and made four appearances for Spain. Hungary were so dominant under Puskas that the 1954 World Cup final was the only game they lost in the entire decade. .He scored 702 goals from 705 career games. The giant of European football was a vocal supporter of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and defected to Spain while on tour after the Soviet Army killed 2,500 of his countrymen while crushing the uprising. .He returned to Hungary after the collapse of Communism and remains worshipped by Hungarians. .Germany’s most-capped player, Matthaus scored 23 goals in 150 international matches. A box-to-box midfielder, he featured in five world cups, helping his side win the 1990 edition. .The only German to be named FIFA World Player of the Year, Matthaus holds the record for most World Cup games (25). His natural leadership gave him a commanding presence on the field, and his technical ability combined with his tactical awareness gave him an unstoppable dominance on the pitch. .The bullish Diego Maradona called him the toughest opponent he had ever faced. .It’s rare that you get prizes just for being a good guy, but Germany’s record goal scorer, the somersaulting Miroslav Klose, has a handful of them. With a career hallmarked by fair play and decency – he famously refused to accept a penalty awarded to him during a club match because he knew the referee was mistaken – Klose scored in four world cups, finally lifting the trophy in 2014. .A physical powerhouse of a forward, his stature belied his speed. He scored 71 goals in 137 matches in a German shirt. He also scored 16 World Cup goals. No one has ever scored more. He was prolific, and a good guy. .“The Phenomenon” reinvented the role of striker while playing for Brazil in 98 matches and scoring 62 goals. He lifted the 1994 World Cup trophy at the age of just 17. .Four years later, he was named Player of the Tournament after steering Brazil into the final, only to suffer a convulsive fit just hours before the game. He scored twice in the 2002 World Cup final to add to his six in the competition earlier, once more lifting the trophy. .A fourth World Cup appearance saw Ronaldo score a then-record-breaking 15th World Cup goal. .But it was the way in which he did it that set the world on fire: Speed, control, vision, total mastery of the ball, explosive runs, juggling the ball past defenders with acrobatic flicks and tricks and the goals. .No compilation of World Cup heroes could omit Franz Beckenbauer, one of only three men – along with Didier Deschamps and Mario Zagallo – to lift the World Cup trophy both as a player and a manager. Despite playing as a defender, Beckenhauer scored 14 goals in his 103 appearances for West Germany, captaining the 1974 winning side. .After playing in the 1966 World Cup final loss to England, he got revenge four years later, scoring a searing goal to knock the English out and send West Germany to the semi-final. .But three World Cup appearances weren’t enough for him, and as Germany marched towards reunification and a new era, Beckenbauer guided the national team as manager to win the 1990 World Cup. In later years, he led Germany’s successful bid to host the 2006 World Cup, a campaign that was later investigated by FIFA over alleged corruption. .The three-time Ballon d’Or winner, one of the most influential figures in the sporting philosophy of Total Football, brought a new level of sophistication to the game. .Football for Cruyff wasn’t just an athletic sport, but a blending of mind, body and artistry – an exercise in simplicity and beauty. .A creative playmaker with a unique understanding of the geometry of players’ pitch positions, he led his team like the conductor of an orchestra. The Netherlands never lost a game in which he scored. And he scored a lot – 33 goals in 48 international matches. .Cruyff led the Netherlands to the final of the 1974 World Cup, scoring twice against Argentina and knocking out then-champions Brazil. It was only the defensive heroics of Franz Beckenbauer that frustrated Cruyff’s efforts on goal and kept the Dutchman from lifting the trophy. .Cruyff didn’t play in the 1978 tournament after a kidnapping attempt led him to reassess his priorities on football’s global stage. But his was a revolutionary legacy, not only at Ajax and Barcelona, where he both played and managed, but also for the Dutch national team and for the future of the game itself. Total Football, “tiki-taka”, the Cruyff turn – all speak to his mastery of the way football should be played. .The drug-addled “Golden Boy” is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of football. His 60-metre dribble past five England players in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final led to the “goal of the century”, yet its mastery followed the sport’s most famous unpenalised handball – the goal that became known as “the hand of God”. .That game epitomised the two sides of Maradona: the raw, prodigious talent of the Argentinian captain, mixed with an absolute disregard for rules, the shameless arrogance of a genius born in the slums, the belief that one’s innate talent sets you apart from – and above – the mere mortals around you. .Argentina went on to win the 1986 World Cup, 10 years after Maradona had made his first appearance for the national side aged just 16. . .He earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals for his country, but no one can know in how much more glory he could have basked were it not for his 1991 arrest for cocaine possession as his off-field life started to spiral. .He played in four World Cup tournaments but did not finish the 1994 tournament after testing positive for ephedrine, a banned substance. .After the final whistle blew on his playing days, he supported various left-wing causes, protesting against the war in Iraq, arguing with the pope over the distribution of wealth and condemning Israel’s bombing of Gaza. Maradona sported tattoos of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro and was Hugo Chavez’s guest of honour at the 2007 Copa America. .After his death aged 60 from cardiac arrest, such was Maradona’s popularity in Argentina that his coffin, draped in the national flag and bedecked with football jerseys, lay in state at the presidential palace as tens of thousands of mourners paid their respects. .Has there ever been a more successful football icon than Brazil’s Pele? .In 1958, when he scored his first World Cup goal – the result of a scuffed mishit that ended Wales’s World Cup dreams for the following seven decades – could anyone have known the giant he was to become? .With either foot, Pele could produce the sort of magic that inspired generations. Off the pitch, as one of the first truly global Black sports superstars, his outspoken support for improving the lives of the poor made him a national hero. .Pele lifted the World Cup three times: 1958, 1962 and 1970. He remains Brazil’s leading goal scorer with 77 goals in 92 games. He was so famous, so beloved all around the world that in 1969, both sides in Nigeria’s brutal civil war agreed to a ceasefire so they could watch Pele play in an exhibition match in Lagos. .A prolific goal scorer, he could play from any position on the field with vision and flair. He was never selfish, linking with other team players to produce generous assists. His charismatic leadership on and off the pitch led to a legacy lauded by figures as diverse as Nelson Mandela and Henry Kissinger. .“There’s Pelé the man and then Pelé the player,” France’s Michel Platini said. “And to play like Pelé is to play like God.”",644

When: 9pm (19:00 GMT) .The shock announcement of Gerard Piqué’s retirement from football on Thursday means that this will be the final appearance of the Barca great at the club’s iconic Catalan home. It will be his 616th appearance across all competitions, the club’s fifth-highest tally. .But Saturday is not all about Piqué. Barcelona are trailing Real Madrid by only one point at the top of La Liga, and sense their chance to return to the top. Newly promoted Almeria may not provide much of a challenge as Barcelona continue their charge, and defender Piqué will be hoping for a clean sheet in his final home game. .Where: Banc of California Stadium, California
When: 4pm (20:00 GMT) .The final of the 2022 Major League Soccer Cup (MLS) may well turn out to be the best MLS match-up in years. Philadelphia is a city riding high in the sports world: Two of its teams are in major title contention, with the Phillies currently surging towards glory in baseball’s World Series. Los Angeles, meanwhile, find themselves under the guidance of the mercurial Steve Cherundolo, who has been widely tipped to become the next head coach of the US men’s national football team. .Los Angeles FC (LAFC) scored six goals in their two playoff games, and remain unbeaten at home against Eastern Conference sides. The last three games between these two sides have ended in draws. But if Philadelphia do get on the scoreboard, watch out for another – the Union have scored twice in five minutes no fewer than 13 times this season. .Where: Gewiss Stadium, Bergamo
When: 7pm (17:00 GMT) .Napoli, sitting on the top of Itay’s Serie A with a comfortable five-point lead, travel to second-place Atalanta. .Both sides are in form, losing only once this season. Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti is looking for his first Italian title, and could take a big step towards that goal with a win on Saturday. But Atalanta’s defence – statistically only second in Serie A to Juventus this season – will not make that an easy task. .Where: Nef Stadyumu, Istanbul
When: 7pm (17:00 GMT) .Galatasaray would make it four unbeaten games at home if they can pull off a victory against local rivals Besiktas, who sit one place above them in Turkey’s Super Lig. .A win for Besiktas, meanwhile, would put four points between the two teams – but they will need to overcome a Galatasaray defence which has conceded only nine goals in the league this season. .Besiktas, who have found the net 25 times in their 12 league matches so far this season, are also buoyed by the recent return of Senol Gunes as head coach. That said, keep an eye out for Galatasaray’s Kazimcan Karatas returning from injury. This will not be an easy game for either team. .Where: Etihad Stadium, Manchester
When: 3pm (15:00 GMT) .Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola has said Premier League top goalscorer Erling Haaland – who has netted 22 goals across all competitions already this season – could return to action against Fulham after being rested for City’s Champions League clash with Sevilla this week. .But Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker are still not fit to make the match-day squad, as City sit two points behind leaders Arsenal. .Newly promoted Fulham have had a flying start to the season, sitting in seventh place in the Premier League, but head coach Marco Silva will need to ensure Fulham do not waste any opportunities they may be lucky enough to get against a City side on a 14-game win streak at home.",645

They rang truer when the country was hit by the most powerful earthquake ever recorded (9.5 magnitude) in 1960. .Preparations for the tournament were severely affected and the number of host cities was cut down from eight to three. .When the tournament finally began, all four South American giants started with a win. Europe’s big names slowly registered their points following low-scoring draws and wins. Goal difference was introduced as the deciding factor for qualification into the knockouts, doing away with replays in case of a draw. .On-field action included clashes and not just football. The worst show was during Chile’s group match against Italy when both sets of players exchanged kicks and punches. .The match was termed the Battle of Santiago, and the Italian team was escorted out of the ground by police. .The home side exceeded expectations by winning two of their three group matches and beating European champions USSR to make it to the semis where they were beaten by defending champions and favourites Brazil. .In the other semi-final, Czechoslovakia beat Yugoslavia in front of a small crowd. .In the decider, Brazil trailed early on but once again found their way back to land a second consecutive World Cup title. .Garrincha took on the responsibility of leading Brazil’s attack after Pele got injured in the group match against Czechoslovakia. .After the devastating earthquake of 1960, the host nation had much to cheer about as they were able to put together the tournament and finish third. .Four players shared the golden boot award. .After lighting up the 1958 World Cup, Pele was widely regarded as the best player in the world and was under the spotlight four years later. However, his injury in the group stages kept him out of the rest of the tournament. .The introduction of goal difference as the deciding factor in qualification for the quarterfinal brought out defensive tactics and low-scoring games. The average number of goals scored per tournament dropped to 2.78, the lowest it has ever been. .Fights marred the games and the use of police to protect the players became a necessity.",646
647,Published On 4 Nov 2022,Qatar official slams ‘hypocrisy’ of World Cup criticism,The foreign minister says calls to boycott the 2022 World Cup are ‘unfortunate’.,".Qatar’s foreign minister has denounced the “hypocrisy” of people calling for a boycott of the football World Cup to protest against alleged human rights in the Gulf country. .Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told Le Monde in an interview published on Thursday that most of the world was looking forward to the tournament that starts in Doha this month, and that the “attacks” were being made “by a very small number of people”. .“It is frankly unfortunate. The reality is that the world is looking forward to this celebration. Over 97 percent of the tickets have been sold. Among the 10 countries that bought the most tickets, we find European countries like France,” Al Thani, who is also the deputy prime minister, said. .Qatar is the first country in the Middle East to host the football World Cup but it has faced a wave of criticism since it was awarded the tournament in 2010. In particular, its treatment of migrant workers and its human rights records have been under the spotlight, leading to calls for teams to boycott the tournament altogether. .The country faced widespread criticism from human rights groups for its previous use of the kafala system – under which workers are tied to an employer whose consent they need to change jobs in the form of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) – a law that rights activists have argued tied their presence in Qatar to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .The kafala system was abolished in August 2020 in Qatar amid other landmark changes, including the introduction of a minimum wage. .Several Gulf countries have, in recent years, enacted reforms to their kafala systems, which were once prevalent across the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. .Responding to a query on why it took so long for Qatar to abolish the kafala setup, considering all the stadiums had been built by 2020, Al Thani said such reforms “take time”. .“This is true for any country – it is not unique to Qatar. Of course, there are still flaws and we are determined to fix them,” he said. .However, the deputy prime minister said there was a “double standard” in “systematically” blaming the Qatari government for the problems facing labourers, while in Europe, “the slightest incident is blamed on the company”. .“I think there are some people who don’t accept that a small country in the Middle East is hosting such a global event,” he added. .In the interview, Al Thani said Qatar was a “very welcoming country” and that the “entire world is welcome in our country”. .“All we ask is that fans respect our laws, just as we are expected to respect yours when we visit you,” he added. .The deputy prime minister said there would not be confrontations between security forces and fans unless certain behaviours put people in danger. “That is the only situation in which they would intervene.” .When asked what policy Qatar would adopt if players were to speak on non-sporting issues, Al Thani said they “will be free to do so, we will never stop anyone from expressing themselves”. .Several participating teams have highlighted the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar, including Denmark, Australia and England. .Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister said Qatar will continue to host sports tournaments in the future to help “unite” people. .“Our ambition is to do things that bring people together and unite them. Sport is an important tool to achieve this goal. Our country is ready to host major sporting events. The World Cup is just one example of this,” he said. .The World Cup will take place from November 20 to December 18.",647

It said, “The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population.” .The government said there were 37 deaths between 2014 and 2020 among workers directly linked to the construction of World Cup stadiums, of which three were “work-related”. .Denmark recently announced its players would wear a “toned down” kit during the World Cup, with Danish manufacturer Hummel saying it “does not wish to be visible” at a tournament that “has cost thousands of lives”. .“We support the Danish national team, but that isn’t the same as supporting Qatar as a host nation,” it said. .Khaled al-Suwaidi, a senior member of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, responded to Denmark’s announcement, saying the country has used the World Cup “as a catalyst to drive change” and has reformed its migrant worker laws. .The Australian national team recently released a video criticising Qatar for its human rights record and calling for the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships, which are strictly prohibited in Qatar. .The tournament’s organisers praised the Australian players for “using their platforms to raise awareness for important matters”. Still, they added, “No country is perfect, and every country – hosts of major events or not – has its challenges.” . .The captains of nine teams will wear rainbow armbands to support the LGBTQ community. .World Cup organisers have said everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome while also warning against public displays of affection. .Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp recently stated that he believed it was “not fair” to expect players to make political statements. “The decision [to hold the tournament in Qatar] was made by other people, and if you want to criticise anybody, criticise the people who made the decision,” he said. .In a recent television interview, the German minister for sport, Nancy Faeser, appeared to question whether Qatar should stage the tournament due to the alleged mistreatment of migrant workers and the LGBTQ community. .She later said her remarks had been “misinterpreted“, adding, “It is important to support the country of Qatar in groundbreaking reforms.”",648

Applications can be made online through the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 website or the Hayya to Qatar 22 mobile app. .“All parties will work to ensure the safety and security of the fans.

They are also not required to preregister on the government’s Ehteraz health application before their arrival. .In addition, a COVID vaccination certificate is no longer required to enter Qatar.",650

After receiving lengthy treatment he was then helped off the field and appeared visibly disoriented. .Tottenham Hotspur announced on Wednesday that Son will have an operation “to stabilise a fracture around his left eye”. . .The Premier League club did not say how long Son will be out of action for. .“Following surgery,” the team said, “Son will commence rehabilitation with our medical staff, and we shall update supporters further in due course.” .The World Cup starts on November 20 with South Korea due to play its first group game against Uruguay four days later. South Korea will also face Portugal and Ghana in Group H. .The nation has appeared at 10 previous World Cups, finishing fourth in 2002 when they co-hosted the tournament with Japan. .At the 2018 World Cup, South Korea exited at the group stage with Son scoring two of their three goals in the tournament. .Son also scored in his country’s last match, a 1-0 win over Cameroon in September. .Last season, Son was the top scorer along with Liverpool FC’s Mohamed Salah in the Premier League with 23 goals. .This season he has been less prolific, notching just three goals in the Premier League – all in one game – and two Champions League goals. .Tottenham Hotspur are set to play Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Leeds before the World Cup begins.",651
652,Published On 2 Nov 2022,New concussion protocol in place for World Cup 2022,FIFA medical staff will work alongside team doctors under the credo ‘suspect and protect’ at the tournament in Qatar.,".During the 2014 World Cup final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer fell to the ground after a collision with Argentina’s Ezequiel Garay. .After some lengthy medical treatment, he was allowed to continue but approached the referee Nicola Rizzoli and asked, “Ref, is this the final?”. .It would turn out that Kramer, who slumped to the ground 14 minutes later, had suffered a concussion, also known as a mild traumatic brain injury that affects the brain’s function. .It is this type of incident that FIFA will look to avoid at this year’s tournament with the introduction of a series of measures to identify and treat concussive injuries. .This includes the FIFA Medical Concussion Protocol, which follows the credo “suspect and protect”. The protocol provides team doctors and medics with a step-by-step guide to dealing with concussions. .FIFA’s Medical Director, Dr Andrew Massey, says that the guide “begins with baseline screening of all players, and this gives the team doctor not only a chance to understand how an individual player’s brain normally operates but to educate that player on the gravity of concussive injuries”. .Speaking on FIFA’s Living Football magazine show, he added that the compact geographical nature of Qatar would help FIFA to work alongside team doctors: “We are able to pull a lot of our medical services into centralised locations to effectively form a polyclinic”. .Massey, who was previously Liverpool FC’s head of medical services, says that FIFA’s medical team will work closely with participating member association team doctors and medical teams; “Having that close relationship with the team doctors allows them to maybe suggest things that we haven’t thought of, or I haven’t thought of, that we can put in place that helps them to provide the best environment so that their players can flourish.” .Symptoms of concussions include headaches, dizziness or general confusion and can take hours or days to appear. This places pressure on the medical staff, who have to decide whether to remove a player who has suffered a collision even if the player appears fine. .In the event of an actual or suspected concussion, Qatar 2022 protocol allows for a single additional permanent concussion substitution (APCS). This substitution allows a team to withdraw a player who may have suffered a brain injury but does not impact the five permitted substitutions. The opposing team is granted an additional substitution with each APCS to avoid any advantage. .It will be the first time such a rule is implemented at a FIFA World Cup. .Medical staff, known as “concussion spotters”, will also review video technology for possible concussions. .Two additional permanent concussion substitutions (APCS) have been allowed in the Premier League since February 2021, when they were introduced as a trial. .The Premier League, Football Association and English Football League have since adopted the rule permanently.",652

654,Published On 2 Nov 2022,"Haaland, Salah, Pogba and others we won’t see at World Cup 2022","From Haaland to Salah and Pogba, this year’s World Cup will be without some of the biggest names in football.",".The World Cup is the biggest showcase event in football. .It is expected that the game’s biggest names will put on their best performances and help their teams reach new heights while also mesmerising fans. .But some of the football world’s biggest superstars will not be plying their trade at this year’s event in Qatar that kicks off on November 20. .Of the 211 FIFA member nations, only 32 were able to book a spot at the World Cup 2022, causing heartbreak to players such as Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Gianluigi Donnarumma as Norway, Egypt and Italy were among the teams which failed to qualify. .Here is a list of 10 players missing from the World Cup  due to their teams’ failure to qualify for the tournament. .A special mention for Paul Pogba, who will miss France’s title defence in Qatar due to injury. .Erling Haaland made his international debut at the age of 19, and has scored 21 goals in 23 matches. .However, Haaland, arguably the world’s current best young striker, could only score five goals during the World Cup qualifiers. Norway collected 18 points from its 10 qualification matches and finished third behind the Netherlands and Turkey in the group. .The Manchester City player has been in sensational form this season, becoming the fastest player (nine games) to score 15 goals in the English Premier League. .The 22-year-old has time on his side and will have plenty of opportunities to make up for missing out in 2022. .“I might be in Qatar during the World Cup,” Egypt’s Mohamed Salah told a television channel back in August. .However, one of the biggest stars of the football world will not be on the pitch during the Middle East’s first World Cup as his country failed to qualify for the tournament. .Egypt and Salah were on the wrong side of a penalty shootout against Senegal twice in the space of two months. .First, they lost the Africa Cup of Nations final in February. Then came the World Cup qualification playoff, which went to a penalty shootout after two legs. .Salah’s kick from the spot sailed over the goal as Egypt lost 3-1 on penalties. .Salah’s appearance at the 2018 World Cup in Russia was hampered by injury, and he failed to take his team past the group stages. .At 30, it remains to be seen if Salah can make an attempt to play another World Cup. .David Alaba won his third Austrian sports personality of the year award this year, in addition to his eight Austrian Footballer of the Year awards, and the quadruple with Real Madrid in the 2021-22 season. .Despite being arguably Austria’s best footballer over the past decade, the former Bayern Munich defender has not played a World Cup as his country has not qualified for the tournament since 1998. .The 30-year-old, who has also captained Austria, was part of the starting XI when his side played Wales in their Nations League playoff tie in March. Austria’s disappointing run in the qualification process, with five wins from their 10 games, ended in a 2-1 loss in Cardiff. .The Real Madrid defender has made 96 international appearances for Austria, and has scored 14 goals. .Winner of the CAF African Footballer of the Year award in 2016, the Africa Cup of Nations in 2016, and the Premier League with two different clubs, Riyad Mahrez has been consistently one of the best players from Africa in recent years. .The France-born winger was part of Algeria’s 2014 World Cup squad but made little impact. His team failed to qualify for the 2018 edition but were on the verge of making it to Qatar until a late Cameroon goal knocked them out in extra time of their playoff tie. .Algeria’s absence in Qatar could bring an end to Mahrez’s hopes of playing another World Cup as he will be 35 in four years. .A leader on the pitch for club and country at the age of 23, Martin Odegaard’s journey from youth to professional football has been swift. .The Norwegian made his professional league debut at the age of 15 and became the youngest goal-scorer in his country’s premier league. He was snapped up by Real Madrid a year later but kept moving between Spain and the Netherlands before finally making himself at home in London with Arsenal. .Odegaard has been regarded as one of the best young talents and it was no surprise that he broke the record for the youngest debutant for Norway’s senior side at the age of 15. The midfielder has been praised for his vision with the ball at his feet, his precision with set pieces and ability to create space. .However, his leadership and talent were not enough to see his side through to the World Cup. Norway finished third in their group. With the talent of Odegaard, Haaland and others at their disposal, it was a surprising result. .When Gianluigi Buffon quit international football, Italy had little trouble finding his successor. Not only did Gianluigi Donnarumma replace his namesake and idol with confidence, he established himself as the best young goalkeeper in the world. .Donnarumma made his professional debut for AC Milan in 2015, and cemented his place in the starting XI the following year. in 2021, he moved to Paris St-Germain. .Just as Buffon’s career was ending, Donnarumma began establishing himself as a worthy successor. He replaced Buffon in a match in 2016, becoming the youngest goalkeeper to play for Italy at the age of 17 years. .Donnarumma was named the UEFA Player of the Tournament in the Euro 2020 championship (played in 2021) for his crucial role in helping Italy win the trophy. .Italy’s failure to qualify for yet another World Cup means that Donnarumma will have to wait at least another four years before making his World Cup debut. .Unlike other breakout stars from Africa, Franck Kessie’s journey to the top of European club football did not begin at an early age. .The Ivorian played club football in his home country until the age of 18 before making a move to Italy with Atalanta. Once in Italy, he made his mark upon joining AC Milan where he made 223 appearances and scored 37 goals in five seasons. Kessie became a fan favourite and was found among them after scoring his last goal for the club at the end of the 2021-22 season. .When Kessie left Milan for Barcelona, it was seen as a loss for the Italian side as he played an important role in bringing Milan back to the top of Italian football. .Kessie made his Ivory Coast debut at the age of 17 and has scored seven goals in 60 international games.  While he hasn’t played many big tournaments for the Elephants, he was the joint top-assist provider in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations where his side was knocked out in the quarter-finals. .Ivory Coast’s qualification for the 2022 World Cup was on the line until their last match against Cameroon. A win or draw would have landed the Elephants in Qatar, but they were unable to score and a 21st-minute goal confirmed Cameroon’s qualification and brought heartache for Kessie and his team. .One of the biggest stars, and the joint leading goal-scorer of the 2021 Copa America, Luis Diaz has swiftly become the poster boy of Colombian football. He has scored eight goals in 37 appearances since his international debut in 2018. .However, Diaz will not be able to put his talent on display in Qatar as Colombia failed to qualify for Qatar 2022 after finishing sixth in the CONMEBOL standings. The 25-year-old Liverpool winger showed his despair in a Twitter post following Colombia’s last match in the qualification stage. .“Since I was little I dreamed of wearing this shirt and wearing it with pride in a World Cup. It hurts too much not to have achieved it. I keep wanting to fight for this dream, on my part you will have my commitment and know that I will leave everything to achieve that goal. We will have revenge.” .Diaz will have to wait another four years to see if he can live his dream. .Marco Verratti has been considered one of the best midfielders in the world since he was named the best player of the Italian second division in 2011-12. He was snapped up by PSG the following season, and was swiftly named the best young player in Ligue 1. .Soon after his rise in club football, Verratti made his international debut for Italy at the age of 20, but injuries and Italy’s poor performance in the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 kept him away from top international action. .Verratti was the main cog in Roberto Mancini’s midfield for Italy’s triumphant run at Euro 2020, where he finished with 93 percent passing accuracy. .Italy’s shock defeat at the hands of North Macedonia will keep Verratti and co away from Qatar. .Victor Osimhen is a promising young striker from Nigeria, a Golden Boot winner at the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2015, and the leader of Napoli’s attack in Serie A. .The 23-year-old from Lagos has quickly established himself among the top strikers in Italian football, scoring 30 goals in 68 appearances for the club since 2020. Prior to playing in Italy, Osimhen played for Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. .The Super Eagles’ player came to the limelight for the first time when he struck an astonishing 10 goals, six more than the second best, in the U-17 World Cup and helped Nigeria win the trophy for a record fifth time. .Since his debut for the senior side, Osimhen has scored 15 goals in 22 appearances. .Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup will deny Osimhen the opportunity to put his talent on display at the biggest football event. However, with age on his side, the young striker will surely have a chance of playing at another World Cup should his side qualify.",654
655,Published On 2 Nov 2022,COVID during the World Cup in Qatar: Should you be worried?,Qatar expects to welcome more than 1.2 million visitors as some epidemiologists warn of a third pandemic winter.,".Doha, Qatar – The World Cup 2022 will be one of the first major sporting events since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that will not have limitations on crowd numbers, and all eight stadiums will be allowed to fill to their maximum capacities. .The tournament kicks off on November 20 in Qatar and is expected to attract more than 1.2 million people to witness the biggest sporting event in the world. .In recent months, music festivals, political gatherings and business events have taken place with little to no health-related limitations. .Qatari authorities dropped COVID-related travel restrictions starting on Tuesday, including mandatory pre-arrival testing, so fans travelling from abroad will no longer need to show a negative COVID-19 test before boarding their flights to Qatar. .COVID-related hospitalisations and deaths are dropping, but as winter looms in the Northern Hemisphere and people spend more time indoors, health experts are warning of another global coronavirus wave. .In October, the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said Europe was entering its third pandemic winter and COVID-19 and seasonal influenza were “co-circulating”, increasing risks for vulnerable communities, such as the elderly and people with disabilities. .In the United States, cases of the new Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ1.1 have doubled in recent weeks and could lead to a large surge of COVID-19 cases, according to some scientists. .To date, there have been more than 629 million confirmed infections globally and almost 6.6 million deaths. .While announcing its new health regulations, Qatar’s government said the contact-tracing app Ehteraz will no longer be necessary for entering any buildings except for health facilities. .On October 19, the government also announced that masks will no longer be required on public transport. .In a statement about the rollback of health controls, the health ministry pointed to the national vaccination programme and the continuing drop of COVID-19 cases in Qatar and around the world. .Cases in the Gulf country of 2.9 million people have decreased 34 percent from September 19 to October 17. To date, the country has recorded more than 465,000 infections and over 680 deaths since the pandemic began. .A resident of Qatar told Al Jazeera that she understood why restrictions were being removed, but she said it was still important to “keep your guard up”. .“For more than two years now, we have had a safety net of sorts,” said the resident, who wished to remain anonymous. “We had mask mandates, the need to be vaccinated, boosted and what not. .“Now it will mostly be gone. It makes me very uneasy because it’s not like the pandemic is over.” .Laith Abu-Raddad, a professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Cornell University in Doha, said a large number of people coming together at the World Cup can result in more infections. .“There will be lots of mass gatherings, where people will be close to each other – inside the stadium, queues outside, fan zones, parties indoors where friends will watch the games together,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is why it is important for everyone to keep at least some measures of caution and avoid crowding in close proximity to other people.” .Abu-Raddad said it was “extremely important” for those over 50 to get their booster shots. .“This is really the simplest thing anyone can do to protect themselves because older people and people with co-morbidities are the people who have the highest risk,” he said. .Yet Zein Abid, who works as a security guard in Doha, said he and his friends have “almost forgotten” about COVID-19 and how it had previously “taken over” their lives for two and a half years. .“It’s something we have come to live with,” Abid told Al Jazeera. “I feel Qatar has handled the pandemic better than most countries … Death rates have been low. I think we will be fine.” .Abu-Raddad said that while he expects a rise in infections during the World Cup, the number of severe cases and hospitalisations were unlikely to reach “serious levels”. .For one thing, he said, there are high levels of immunity worldwide. More than 69 percent of people on the planet have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine while 64 percent are fully vaccinated. .“Fans will be coming for a few days,” Abu-Raddad added. “It’s not like they’re coming here for a long time where they were going to get infected, infect others and be hospitalised here.”",655

In August 2020, Qatar announced changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for a no-objection certificate (NOC) to change employment. .The announcement was the latest in a series of labour reforms which it said were part of a process launched before it was awarded the World Cup. .The ILO, in the report, added that Qatar’s labour ministry has approved about 350,000 applications by migrant workers to change jobs in the two years since these reforms were introduced. .The report added that many workers still face hurdles in leaving jobs and moving to new ones, including retaliation from their employers. .Workers have also told Al Jazeera of the difficulties in switching jobs, from cancellation of residency permits and threats of deportation by private sponsors and false absconding cases registered against them. .In March last year, Qatar became the first country in the Gulf to adopt a minimum wage that applies to all workers. .The new legislation ensured all employees receive a minimum monthly wage of 1,000 Qatari riyals ($275), as well as a minimum allowance of 300 riyals for food and 500 riyals for housing, unless their employer provides both. .ILO said 280,000 people saw their salaries rise to the new minimum threshold – termed inadequate by workers and rights groups – since the new legislation was introduced. .Last month, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said his country faced an “unprecedented campaign” of criticism in the lead-up to the World Cup. .“Since we won the honour of hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been subjected to an unprecedented campaign that no host country has ever faced,” Sheikh Tamim said in a speech. “We initially dealt with the matter in good faith, and even considered that some criticism was positive and useful, helping us to develop aspects of ours that need to be developed. .“But it soon became clear to us that the campaign continues, expands and includes fabrication and double standards, until it reached a level of ferocity that made many question, unfortunately, about the real reasons and motives behind this campaign.”",658

All in all, it’s turning out to be a very expensive World Cup for a lot of people.” .Only about 500 fans are expected to make the trip to Qatar from Costa Rica. And faced with strong rivals, it is a long way to go for what might be a short campaign. .Costa Rica did top its group in 2014 that featured England, Italy and Uruguay. .“The truth is we like being in a group like this one,” said Michael Umaña, Costa Rica’s 2014 penalty hero. .“Compete with the best. That’s what you do in a World Cup, face the best. I feel optimistic. I know our national team shows its best when it faces the world’s most powerful.”",659

Hundreds of the best football players across the planet will have the honour of competing for their country. But to become one of those players requires an endless amount of dedication, hard work, and luck. Today, we’re taking a break from the news for something a little bit different. We’re sharing the story of one man trying to reach the top tiers of his sport. .Abdoulaye Diaby: If I didn’t want to become a football player, I wouldn’t go to Belgium. .Malika Bilal: That’s Abdoluaye Diaby. He’s a football, or soccer, player from Mali. Back in 2018, he was a rising star in his home country. But to reach the next level of his career, he had to make a sacrifice. At the age of 18, Diaby left his family, friends, and home country behind to play for one of Belgium’s top teams. He’s one of the many African football players to go north to try and find success. His tumultuous first year abroad is the subject of a recent film from Al Jazeera’s award-winning program Witness. .Abdoulaye Diaby: They say it’s going to be hard: the climate, the lifestyle, the people. I’ve never lived alone far from home. .Malika Bilal: So, we’re bringing you the ups and downs of Diaby’s year in Belgium. I’m Malika Bilal, and this is the Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: To share his story, we’re hearing from one of the filmmakers behind the documentary Abdoulaye Diaby: The Away Game. .Benjamin Chevallier: I’m Benjamin Chevallier. I co-directed the documentary called Diaby with another French director, Quentin Coulon. We directed this film together. .Malika Bilal: Benjamin and Quentin met Abdoulaye Diaby in 2016. They were studying cinema in Paris at the time. And during the summer they taught classes to young film students in Bamako, Mali’s capital. .Benjamin Chevallier: We were teaching classes during the day and after classes, at the end of the afternoon, we visited a very impressive football pitch nearby our home. So we went there because we were curious, we wanted to know what was this very beautiful football pitch in the middle of this city. So we asked one of the coaches, what team is playing here? .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Benjamin Chevallier: And so this coach explained to us that was the training centre of the Djoliba AC, the Djoliba Athletic Club, which is basically the biggest football club in Mali, the oldest, the most prestigious club in Mali. .Malika Bilal: After that first visit, they came back and got to know the coach of Djoliba’s team for players under the age of 17. .Benjamin Chevallier: We were just watching the games and watching the trainings. And also little by little, we became friends with the players. .Malika Bilal: And one of those players was Abdoulaye Diaby, a defender for Djoliba Athletic Club’s youth team. .Benjamin Chevallier: Diaby’s reputation was rising when we met him. He was not a national star but he was definitely a local rising star, I would say. He was well known in Bamako. .Malika Bilal: As Benjamin mentioned, Djoliba is a prestigious club in Mali, which made Diaby famous in his hometown. .Benjamin Chevallier: So when you play in the Djoliba, whether you play for the A-team, the B-team, or the youngsters’ team, you are local celebrity. Everybody knows you. You walk in the street and people say hello, stuff like that. And also he was a local star because he was playing for the under 17 national team. .Malika Bilal: And that team won the African Cup of Nations in its age bracket. .Benjamin Chevallier: And in 2017, he was elected best African player of the under 17 African Cup of Nations, which was really a very strong achievement for him. .Malika Bilal: As Diaby’s star was rising, Benjamin and Quentin got to know him during their visits to the football pitch. .Benjamin Chevallier: And then it was the end of the summer. We came back to France. But we stayed in touch with Diaby through WhatsApp. And a few months later, he told us that he had been offered a contract by a big European football club. And so that you had the opportunity to go and to play soccer in, in Europe, in Belgium. So we thought it was amazing and we asked him if he was okay if we film his first season. He agreed and that’s basically how it all started. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: Diaby was being offered a place at Royal Antwerp FC, the oldest football club in Belgium’s top league, in 2018. For many players, it would be a dream come true. But that wasn’t necessarily the case for Diaby. .Abdoulaye Abdoulaye Diaby: For me, Belgium is just a place where I can improve. It’s not that I want to go there. I’d rather stay at home. .Benjamin Chevallier: Contrary to a lot of his friends and contrary to a lot of his teammates, he was not dreaming about Europe. He was not fantasising about going to Europe, living the European way of life. He was actually living a very decent life in Bamako. But still, he wanted to make a living out of his abilities as a football player. He wanted to be able to live as a football player in financial terms. It’s very difficult to do that in Africa. So when he was offered this opportunity to go and play in Belgium, he made a pragmatic choice. .Abdoulaye Diaby: I’ll earn in five years what a Malian civil servant makes in a lifetime. I’ll sign a contract and other contracts until I’m 35. With that money, I’ll live the rest of my life and support my children and their children. .Malika Bilal: So with that pragmatism in mind, Diaby flew off to Belgium to begin his European career. .Abdoulaye Diaby: I was lucky. There were a lot of us. We grew up together. We did everything together. I just got lucky – a bit more lucky. .Malika Bilal: While the film obviously focuses quite a bit on Diaby’s sport, some of its most compelling moments come as he talks about the difference in his quality of life after the move, especially the sense of community. .Abdoulaye Diaby: I almost went crazy when I arrived. I’ve been here for seven months. I don’t know who lives across the hall. I only see people in the lift. No hello. No how are you? Nobody cares about anybody. Imagine coming here as an immigrant, hungry, you have no money and you don’t know anyone. You’re dead. In Mali, if you’re hungry, we’ll give you food. That’s the difference between Africa and Europe. .Benjamin Chevallier: The most difficult challenge he faced when he got to Europe was the loneliness he discovered. In Mali, he was living with his family in the same house. .[SOUNDS FROM A BIRTHDAY PARTY] .Benjamin Chevallier: The house was completely open. Everybody was coming and going. And so he was always surrounded by the people he loved. Consequently, when you got to Europe, and he was alone in his apartment, it was very difficult for him and his smartphone basically became his best friend. I remember he was spending more than eight, nine hours a day on WhatsApp talking to his friend and his family back home. That’s, by the way, one of the reasons we decided to use excerpts from his WhatsApp conversation in the film. Because when you got to Europe, he was living as much on his phone as he was living in the real life. .Malika Bilal: At the same time, Diaby was contending with some more traditional challenges, like the change in the weather from Mali to Belgium. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: And there was something else he struggled with, something that many other teens might relate to when moving out of their family home: what to eat. .Benjamin Chevallier: He was not even able to cook an egg, so it was completely disturbing for him. So he also had to learn to make food for himself. It’s very simple, but it was also a very big challenge actually for him. And at first, everything he was cooking for himself was completely not edible. So, it took time for him to adapt to this new adult European life actually. .Malika Bilal: Being a professional athlete made this transition into adulthood more complicated. .Benjamin Chevallier: He discovered that being a professional football player in Europe means that your everyday life is controlled outside of the pitch. So they control what you eat. They control when you go to sleep. They control what you drink, what you do during the weekends. Of course, you can not go to clubs. You cannot go to party. Otherwise, your performances will not be as good. And for Diaby, it was difficult because he was a teenager. In Mali, he was eating what women were making for him. It was not always very good nutrition. In Mali, it was not uncommon that he was eating rice from Monday to Sunday every day and without any meat or stuff like that. Not because he was poor, but just because it was like very rare to find good meat in Bamako. When he got to Europe and he discovered that you had to eat a certain amount of meat during a week, that he had to eat fruits, that he had to eat vegetables, that it was not a good thing to go to a McDonald’s or fast food or kebabs every weekend. And for a teenager, it was yeah, it was also difficult because he had to control himself. He was a teenager with a very controlled life with nutritionists following him, so there is a contradiction there, I think. .Abdoulaye Diaby: I don’t know what to do in this town. I can’t live like a European teenager. I’m focused on football. I play ball and I rest. I play ball and I rest. .Malika Bilal: On top of that, Diaby wasn’t finding the immediate success he expected upon his move to Belgium. First of all, he was playing for Royal Antwerp’s B-team. It’s not the team that you’d watch on TV each weekend; it’s a reserve team. And so Diaby found himself in a position he hadn’t encountered before. .Abdoulaye Diaby: In Mali, everybody knows me. Everybody knows what I can do. Here, nobody knows me. I have to prove who I am. So when I play, I think more about my personal performance than about the clubs. .Benjamin Chevallier: In Mali, he was really a rising star. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Benjamin Chevallier: He was used to be the most important player of his team. He is very confident in himself. When he got to Europe, the biggest challenge in terms of football was to rebuild all that. .Abdoulaye Diaby: I want to move up to the A-team. I just think about playing. Well, I only think about myself. I just want to show who I am and every time I play, I need to outdo myself. I need to make a name for myself all over again. .Benjamin Chevallier: It was difficult because when he got to Antwerp, he had to prove himself to everybody. He had to show that he had the ability to play there. And at the beginning, he didn’t play so well because the football was different. So he felt that he was not recognised as the talented football player he was. He spent the first six months being on the bench, which never happened to him. So watching that change from our perspective as directors was, of course, very sad. .Malika Bilal: Over the course of the documentary, Benjamin and Quentin documented some of Diaby’s career lows. It’s hard to watch at times. .Abdoulaye Diaby: Since I was born, I’ve never played that badly. I’ve never been shown the red card, but yesterday I got one. I’d never scored my own goal. Yesterday, I did. I know it’ll get better with time. I didn’t get here by accident. .Benjamin Chevallier: In the film, you can feel that Diaby is very strong in his head. .[SOUND OF DIABY PLAYING] .Benjamin Chevallier: So he managed to overcome this first moment of difficulties. Yes, his confidence in himself was shaken, but it was not destroyed. So it was hard at first but thanks to his determination, he managed to overpass this difficult moment. .Malika Bilal: Towards the end of the film, Diaby is waiting to see what the next year holds for him. Not much about his future lies in his own hands. And he makes a comparison: .Abdoulaye Diaby: They gambled money on me. They said he can play. Let’s buy him. We can use him. Like you buy your smartphone. If you want to sell it, you sell it. If it’s damaged, you throw it away. If it’s old, you throw it away. .Benjamin Chevallier: It’s not that he’s sad or that he’s disappointed or that he’s disillusioned. It’s more that he became aware of what it means to be a football player in Europe. When you play for the big clubs, most of all you’re a financial asset. .Malika Bilal: Eventually, Diaby was loaned to another Belgian team, because at the end of the day, like Benjamin said, being a football player is being a financial asset. And when that loan was finished, he was transferred to yet another team, in yet another country – Hungary. And while that might seem like a jarring move, Benjamin says he found more success there. .Benjamin Chevallier: He has been in this new club a year and a half now and it’s going very well for him. .Malika Bilal: Benjamin says that despite all the difficulties Diaby faced in his first year abroad, his story is a success story. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: We might hear about some of the star African players who move to Europe and quickly become international names, but they’re a rarity. There are tons of young players who go abroad and never manage to break into an A-team, like Diaby eventually did. .Benjamin Chevallier: Filming Diaby was most of all I think a human experience because yes, we made the film and yes this film shows his discovery of a new world in a way. But it was also the beginning of a great relationship for me. We became very good friends during the shooting. And we were actually in Budapest, with Quentin two weeks ago to visit him. And we didn’t have any camera gear, no microphones, nothing. We just went there to spend quality time with him. After this first moment of difficulties in Europe, he’s finally getting everything together. And I’m sure that in the upcoming years he will even go further. .Abdoulaye Diaby: They say you want to go? We want you to go. I say, okay, I’ll go. Pay me and I’ll go. It’s to play football, too, right? .Malika Bilal: And that’s The Take. This episode was produced by Negin Owliaei with Ruby Zaman, Amy Walters, Alexandra Locke, Chloe K.

662,Published On 31 Oct 2022,"Q&A: Belgium coach Martinez on team’s diversity, evolution",National team coach Roberto Martinez talks to Al Jazeera about key players and why formations are not important.,".When Roberto Martinez succeeded Marc Wilmots as head coach of the Belgian national team in 2016, he was certain that the team could achieve great things. .Two years later, at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Belgium finished third, the team’s best finish at the tournament, one that featured memorable wins over Japan and Brazil. .Belgium take on Canada in their first match on November 23. Al Jazeera caught up with Martinez about the team’s plans and hopes for the upcoming World Cup: .Al Jazeera: What is your assessment of the teams you will face in your group? .Roberto Martinez: An interesting group because it is very diverse. There is a European nation that we all know very well: Croatia. They’ve got this wonderful generation that finished second in the 2018 World Cup. Since then, there has been a lot of consistency with the coaching and the way they play. .Canada have been very impressive. We follow them very closely, a team that is capable of beating the USA and Mexico. And then Morocco. Unless you are Belgian you do not understand the story but there is a strong link. There are up to five or six players who were born in Belgium and that creates an even stronger link. Even staff members have been with both federations. .There is a very strong community of Moroccan people in Belgium. So the links will make it a big football derby. .Al Jazeera: Belgium finished third in 2018. How has your team changed since then? .Martinez: There has been an evolution. I think we have improved in the competitive nature of having three players for every position. It is becoming harder to reduce our list to 26 players, even in goal. Everyone is growing, developing and progressing in their roles. .Even in the last game in our qualification campaign, we were able to make a lot of changes and maintain our level and way of playing. I have been here since 2016 and you can start to see that we are working in a way that every player comes in knowing what is expected. .Al Jazeera: You’ve been known to use the 3-4-3 formation. How has that evolved with the Belgian national team? .Martinez: I think systems are not important. The system is used sometimes to fit your players and get the best relationships out of them. Sometimes it is to fit the opposition. .The way of playing is important. We are quite flexible, and we have showed our 3-4-3, especially in the World Cup, suits our players much better than other systems. .But there will be moments when we have to change the system and that is a big emphasis that we put on our youngsters. We need to develop players that are flexible, that can play using different systems. .Al Jazeera: Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard are instrumental players and have the quality of making football look so easy. What’s it like to coach such talented players? .Martinez: They are two players I prefer enjoying as a fan. We don’t look in Belgium often at two players who are so contrasting in the exceptional talent that they bring. We need to enjoy them. It’s not about assessing them or trying to influence them. It’s more… we need to enjoy what they bring. .They do bring extreme talents. Eden likes to slow down the moment that he is on the ball and then execute in one-on-one situations. Kevin de Bruyne accelerates the tempo of the game by executing incredible actions of the attacking play. But like all the top players, they have a very good connection. .That is the beautiful aspect of what we have in Belgium. We enjoy this generation for what they are. Because we know that this is quite a unique time for our fans to have these kinds of performances in front of them. .Al Jazeera: But Hazard and Romelu Lukaku have struggled with injuries and health issues. Is this a big concern for you? .Martinez: Hazard has found a solution since February. I would say that with the new treatment, he is now pain-free, he is ready to compete and to enjoy his football. The role he has at Real Madrid and in the national team are completely different. I am not concerned at all. Of course, the lack of match fitness can be an issue before a World Cup but we need to adjust those elements. .With Lukaku, it is very similar. In the summer he had the move that he wanted. He is a vital part of a team that is on a huge mission to try to get the Serie A title back in the city. I see him as someone who is enjoying every second of that challenge. .Al Jazeera: There has been a fairly recent explosion of Belgian talent. How did this happen? .Martinez: Well, it was a plan. There is no doubt that this was a conscious decision to sit down and try to identify what could be done to develop Belgian talent in the best possible way. It began in 2000 when the national team was in a very difficult position. .There was a clear direction for all professional teams in Belgium of how to work and how to develop the players from the age of 14 and 15 all the way to the first team. .That’s the initial aspect, but then there was Belgium’s success story in Beijing at the Olympics where this generation started to get a successful feeling. .The clubs in Belgium do a great job at the academy level. There is also the success of each individual player going abroad and becoming very important at the club level and progressing and going to the best clubs in Europe. That prepares players in a manner that you can not plan for. That’s the truth. .Al Jazeera: In 2018, you beat Brazil in the World Cup quarter-final. Does that rank as the most memorable win in your coaching career? .Martinez: It has to be. When you are a little boy and you begin to love the game we all remember a moment on the street re-enacting a World Cup with your friends. .In the World Cup, you have a tournament within a tournament – the knockout phase and the group phase. Playing a knockout game against Brazil, it’s quite unique.

India was briefly suspended for the same reason in August this year. .FIFA confirmed the letter to Reuters news agency but refused to comment further. There was no immediate comment from the TFF. .The letter from Kenny Jean-Marie, FIFA’s director of member associations, to the general secretary of the TFF Wajdi Aouadi reminded the association of its obligation to act independently and avoid undue influence by third parties. .“Any failure to comply with these obligations may result in the imposition of penalties under the FIFA laws, including suspension of the relevant association,” it said. .The team has never made it out of the group stages. At Russia 2018, it registered only its second win in the World Cup and its first since 1978 after defeating Panama 2-1.",664

We were just 10 Cameroonians in Yamoussoukro, but I mobilised them to go support the youth football team,” he said, adding that he was able to see his country win its first AFCON trophy two years later in Abidjan. .Years later, Pickett caught the eyes of Cameroonian officials attending the 1998 AFCON in Burkina Faso because he had covered his body and clothes with paint that matched the green, red and yellow of the country’s flag. .“I was the topic of discussion on the sidelines of the AFCON because nearly every media [outlet] that came to cover the competition took images of me, including most French outlets,” he said. .Joseph Owona, Cameroon’s minister of sports at the time, was so impressed with Pickett that he asked him to take on an important role for the club. .“He said he had met a wonderful Indomitable Lions supporter. He decided to make me the mascot of the team,” Pickett said, adding that Owona helped him go to the World Cup in France that year. .“I really enjoyed a cultural night we had around Notre-Dame Cathedral with seven other Cameroon fans,” he said. “We were in a mini-dance competition with some other nations’ fans and we beat them with our displays. We were given a big carton of champagne. From there, wherever we went, they knew the Cameroonians had come with their exciting dance moves.” .When Pickett isn’t cheering on his team at games, the father-of-two earns extra money entertaining at local events with Cameroun O Mulema, a dance group he founded in Cameroon’s economic capital, Douala. .“We perform at parties, marriages and official events, especially in Douala,” he said. “We travel to other parts of the country when invited. People know me, so I don’t find it difficult.” .He said the money he earns from performing goes to pay for his children’s education. .“I have to do this in periods when we don’t have football competitions,” Pickett said. “It is not easy, but I have been doing it for years now.” .But football is Pickett’s true love, and he is anxiously waiting to hear from the Cameroonian Football Federation (Fecafoot) to see if he can attend the World Cup in Qatar. .“Fecafoot is very aware of our plan to go to Qatar. They have told us they are working on our travel, lodging and other things. I am very hopeful about it.” .Pickett is also hoping the fan group he founded, the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon Supporters Club, will also be able to make the journey to Qatar. .“There are 20 of us who will be taken care of by the Cameroon Football Federation for the World Cup,” Pickett said. “We already started daily practice about a month ago. We are sure of representing Cameroonian fans massively in Qatar.” .Pickett has high hopes for his team in this year’s World Cup. .Cameroon is in Group G and will start their campaign against Switzerland on November 24 before meeting Serbia four days later and wrapping up the group stage against five-time champions Brazil on December 2. .Pickett gave a thumbs-up to the job that Samuel Eto’o, president of Fecafoot, is doing and predicted his team will reach at least the knockout stage of the World Cup. .“I believe we’ll succeed in reaching at least the round of 16 because Eto’o is doing everything possible to get the right players,” he said.",667

The drills were aimed at testing the readiness and responsiveness of the emergency services, local daily The Peninsula reported. .According to the tournament’s security committee, the exercises, dubbed Watan (which translates to nation in Arabic), involved 32,000 government security personnel and 17,000 from the private security sector. .Turkey previously announced it will send more than 3,000 riot police officers to help secure stadiums and hotels. Turkey will also send 100 special operations police officers, 50 bomb specialists and 80 sniffer dogs, it said. .Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu said in January that Turkey has also trained 677 Qatari security personnel in 38 different professional areas, without elaborating on the specifics. . .In August, Pakistan agreed to send troops to Qatar to provide security during the tournament.

Golden boot: Sandor Kocsis (Hungary) .Being one of the few European nations not to be deeply affected by World War II, Switzerland was chosen to host the 1954 World Cup as the tournament returned to Europe after 16 years. .The World Cup was spread across six cities in the Alp nation. Apart from the hosts and defending champions Uruguay, 14 teams qualified from across Europe, the Americas and Asia. .The change in location from the last World Cup in Brazil led to a change in atmosphere from the frivolous and exuberant home crowds to a much smaller audience in stadiums nestled between the Alps. .The on-field action, however, made up for it. The tournament saw several high-scoring games which broke many records. .History of the world cups: .How the football World Cup finally came about in 1930 .The controversies, shocks at the 1934 FIFA World Cup .FIFA World Cup 1938: Italy defend title before WWII breaks out .World Cup 1950: When football’s biggest event resumed after WWII .Austria’s 7-5 defeat of Switzerland after 90 minutes still holds the record for the most goals scored in a World Cup match. .South Korea, meanwhile, were on the receiving end: 16 goals conceded and none scored. .The high-scoring clashes culminated in a final that would be remembered for years as one of the biggest upsets. .Hungary were firm favourites on the back of their Olympic gold in 1952 and an unbeaten run of 32 wins. .Their star-studded lineup was led by football’s first global superstar Ferenc Puskas. .Puskas, however, got injured in the group match against the same opponents and played the final despite not having fully recovered. He was still able to put his side into the lead with a goal in the sixth minute. The favourites seemed on course to a predictable win when Zoltan Czibor scored a second two minutes later. .But the West Germans made their way back into the match with a 10th-minute goal from Max Morlock and one from Helmut Rahn in the 18th minute. .The comeback was completed with a goal from Rahn six minutes from time.

672,Published On 25 Oct 2022,Qatar emir slams ‘ferocious’ campaign against World Cup host,Sheikh Tamim points to an ‘unprecedented campaign no host country has ever faced’ in the lead-up to the tournament.,".Qatar’s emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani says his country has faced an “unprecedented campaign” of criticism in the lead-up to this year’s football World Cup. .World football’s governing body FIFA in 2010 awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, and the host has since spent hundreds of billions of dollars in preparation for the tournament that is due to kick off on November 20. .Throughout, the energy-rich Gulf state has faced constant scrutiny over its treatment of foreign workers, as well as LGBTQ and women’s rights. .“Since we won the honour of hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been subjected to an unprecedented campaign that no host country has ever faced,” Sheikh Tamim said in a speech on Tuesday. .“We initially dealt with the matter in good faith, and even considered that some criticism was positive and useful, helping us to develop aspects of ours that need to be developed,” the emir told Qatar’s legislative council. .“But it soon became clear to us that the campaign continues, expands and includes fabrication and double standards, until it reached a level of ferocity that made many question, unfortunately, about the real reasons and motives behind this campaign.” .FIFA President Gianni Infantino has said the upcoming World Cup, the first to be held in the Middle East, will be the “best ever”. .In August 2020, Qatar announced landmark changes to its labour laws, including scrapping the need for workers to obtain their employer’s permission – in the form of a no-objection certificate – before changing jobs. .Other labour work reforms include the abolishment of the kafala system, the introduction of a minimum wage, and cancelling the requirement for workers to get exit permits from their employers to leave the country. .Earlier this year, Hassan al-Thawadi, head of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, said the labour reforms achieved by Qatar have been “historical” and the event would leave “truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies”. .In recent years, human rights groups have reported extensively on the abuse suffered by migrant workers building World Cup stadiums. .In May, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, along with eight other organisations, sent a letter to Infantino calling for FIFA and Qatar to compensate families of workers who died in the build-up to the World Cup.",672
673,Published On 25 Oct 2022,Can an African team reach the World Cup 2022 semi-finals?,The continent’s representatives would have to punch above their weight in Qatar as no African nation has made it past the last-eight of the World Cup.,".There has been an unmistakable glass ceiling over Africa at football World Cups. .In reaching the quarter-finals in the 1990 World Cup, Cameroon set a benchmark that has not been bettered yet. Senegal and Ghana also reached the last-eight, in 2002 and 2010 respectively, but the continent’s tale of the tape on the global stage has been one of relative underachievement. .Powered by Roger Milla’s swivelling hips and a fearless athleticism, Cameroon’s Indomitable Lions were the shining light of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Wins over holders Argentina, Romania and Colombia set the bar high and, for the first time, an African side claimed three wins at a World Cup. .That performance was widely expected to herald a new age of achievement. It also seemed to justify Pele’s assertion that an African team would win the World Cup by 2000. .However, that prediction would ultimately fall short. .But in 2002, Senegal staked claims for the big prize. Amid a hail of falling seeds early on, the team set out its stall by beating reigning champions France and becoming the first African team to go through a World Cup group stage undefeated. .They were ultimately undone by fatigue and a golden goal, but that success launched the mainstream appeal of Senegalese football. .In 2010, Ghana were the only one of six representatives to advance from the group stage in South Africa. .The Black Stars, combining the experience of their debut in 2006 with the promise of their 2009 under-20 World Cup winning team, played organised, disciplined football and, after wins over Serbia and the USA, came within a handball of a place in the semi-finals. .So, has all that promise and hope disappeared? .The inability of African teams to cross this rubicon is connected to the continent’s economic disadvantages relative to Europe and South America. .According to the World Population Review, going by gross national income per capita (as of 2020), nine of the 10 poorest countries in the world are in Africa. .This creates a snowball effect that affects the continent’s potential, restricting development, enabling corruption and impeding professionalism. .Africa’s World Cup outings have been littered with scandal, mostly about unpaid wages, that has led to opprobrium and derailed focus. .“The politics is too closely involved in the football,” former DR Congo international Gabriel Zakuani told Al Jazeera. .“With African countries, it plays such a big part, especially for the local players who depend on those bonuses. If that doesn’t happen, the focus shifts away from football. So that’s something that should be taken care of before you get to the World Cup or a major tournament.” .Another big talking point is the limited number of slots given to Africa for the World Cup. .For a continent comprising 54 member nations, it only gets five slots, and that, too, only since 1998. .In comparison, Europe, with 55 eligible nations, gets 13, and South America, with only 10 nations, gets between four and five. .From a purely probabilistic standpoint, this severely reduces Africa’s odds of making an impression. It also means Africa’s World Cup qualification is one of the most difficult to negotiate. .In the late 2000s, Egypt bizarrely failed to make the 2006 and 2010 editions, despite winning three straight Africa Cups of Nations and defeating Italy at the 2009 Confederations Cup. .This year, Nigeria and Ivory Coast, both multiple African champions, will miss out in addition to Egypt and Algeria. .Following his side’s elimination from the reckoning, South Africa coach Hugo Broos voiced a popular sentiment on the continent: “It is not fair, it is easier for good teams in Europe to qualify for the World Cup than [good teams] in Africa.” Broos told SA newspaper The Citizen. .Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia and Ghana will represent Africa at Qatar World Cup. .All five have appeared at football’s biggest event previously. Cameroon, Morocco and Senegal made it to the last-eight of the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year. .Tournament experience will not be in short supply, and neither will star power. .Reigning African champions Senegal boast Sadio Mane, Cameroon’s Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa has been one of the best midfielders in the Italian top-flight, Ghana’s diaspora recruitment drive will see them line up the likes of Inaki Williams and Tariq Lamptey in addition to Ajax’s Mohammed Kudus and Arsenal’s Thomas Partey, and Morocco’s wing-back Achraf Hakimi is one of the best players in the world in his position. .According to 1994 African Footballer of the Year Emmanuel Amuneke, Senegal and Morocco represent the continent’s best chance of success in the Middle East. .“The five teams have been tested enough in recent friendlies and they know they must first come out of the group before thinking of a semi-final ticket,” Amuneke said. “One step at a time will do. The tournament in Qatar is a great opportunity for African teams to fix what happened in Russia when no team progressed into the second round.” .His optimism is shared by Zakuani, who was even more bullish on Senegal’s prospects. .“I think there’s always a wildcard at the World Cups,” Zakuani said. “I fancy Senegal to get to the semi-finals. A lot of people may look at me like I’m crazy but for me, Senegal are the team that can shock everyone this time around. .“The five African teams will definitely be out there to compete. I don’t think they’ll be there to make up the numbers. There’s a lot of promise and talent.” .It helps that Senegal have the most forgiving draw, having been drawn with hosts Qatar, Ecuador and the Netherlands in Group A. .Morocco, Cameroon, Tunisia and Ghana all have daunting groups to navigate through, with Belgium, Brazil, holders France and Portugal the top seeds in their respective groups. .The challenge before Africa’s representatives has never been tougher. If they are to break that glass ceiling, they will certainly have to earn it.",673

I was there in 2010, working at Al Jazeera, at our headquarters in Doha. And ever since, I’ve been excited to cover the first World Cup in the Middle East – which is why this was one of the last episodes I worked on before my parental leave. .Over the next weeks, we’ll be bringing you some of the tournament’s biggest stories. .But first, we have a look at the preparations for this World Cup – including all of their controversy – and a preview of what we might expect. .I’m Malika Bilal and this is The Take. .[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: Today, I’m speaking with Tony Karon. He’s the editorial lead at AJ+. He also hosted a podcast for Al Jazeera about the 2018 World Cup, called The Game of Our Lives. And this time around, he’ll be on our show often, as a kind of resident scholar on football, soccer – whatever you’d like to call it. .Tony Karon: It’s a great honour to be your World Cup analyst. I’ve been writing about the World Cup and obsessively following football for 40 years now. So I’ve never played the game. I’ve never coached the game. .[SOUNDS FROM A FOOTBALL MATCH] .Tony Karon: But I have been in the pews, most of my adult – even most of my childhood life. .Tony Karon: So, definitely as a journalist, I’ve always been very aware of underlying meanings of what happens on a football field, and the way I think about the game is most inspired by something that the great Trinidadian political writer CLR James once wrote about cricket. He was trying to capture the anticolonial meaning of cricket. And he had used this aphorism – what do they of cricket know who only cricket know. I.e. You don’t really understand what’s happening in a football stadium unless you know about everything that’s happening outside of that football stadium. .Malika Bilal: Which is a perfect segue because that’s exactly what we want this World Cup preview to be about. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: So let’s start at the beginning. What was your reaction when you found out that the World Cup would be held in Qatar? .Tony Karon: I was excited. I thought, you know, having the World Cup hosted in an Arab country for the first time is a very important move, that breaking of the duopoly that had for most of the history of the tournament been between Europe and Latin America as where the hosting country would be. The first Asian World Cup had happened in 2002 in Korea and Japan. And the first African World Cup had happened in 2010 in my home country, South Africa. And so, to stage a World Cup in the Arab world was a recognition of the global reach of the game, the importance of Arab players and Arab fans. So, I think it was part of a broadening of the epicentres of the game. .Malika Bilal: So in addition to being the first in the Middle East, it’s also the first winter World Cup. What is the significance of that? .Tony Karon: Obviously, Qatar in summer is too hot to stage a World Cup. So, this World Cup is being held in winter. What that means is that the domestic professional league programs of all of the countries in the northern hemisphere, but obviously Europe, particularly, which is the epicentre of the global game, now have a season that’s disrupted by a midyear, you know, month-long break. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: But what it really represents is a deeper power struggle over the global game between two rival centres, the one being FIFA and the confederations that represent the national teams, and the other being the European clubs, which are the most powerful entity in, in the game. So, we also have to be frank. The World Cup is no longer the pinnacle of the global game. .Malika Bilal: That’s because that title now belongs to club football – especially with tournaments like the Champions League, which pits the best European club teams against each other. .Tony Karon: You’ll probably see more of the world’s best players on the field in that game than you would in a World Cup final. .Malika Bilal: And, and why is that? .Tony Karon: That’s because since the 1990s, globalisation has basically opened up the European club leagues to be the equivalent of, you know, what the NBA is in basketball. If you look at, say, the team that Brazil takes to the World Cup, a guaranteed, of the 27 players that they have in their squad, no more than two or three will actually play their weekly football in Brazil. All of them will be based in the top European clubs. .Malika Bilal: And that’s the case for most Latin American and African teams – their players are on the payroll of European clubs. .Tony Karon: That’s where the money is in the game. And it attracts the most highly skilled players. And also, by the way, it’s watched. Like, we know the World Cup final itself is watched by a billion people live, which is incredible. What’s an interesting parallel, though, is the number of people in Africa alone that tune in live every weekend to an English Premier League game is 400 million. It’s all about money. .Malika Bilal: So what we have now is a power struggle over the world’s most popular sport. FIFA, the sport’s international governing body, is pushing for more viewers. .Newsreel: FIFA is intensifying its push for a World Cup every other year.  .Newsreel: Cynics will say the reason FIFA want to do this is because they want to increase their revenues. .Malika Bilal: And a World Cup every two years would mean less time for the club teams, who are also trying to solidify their hold on the game. .Tony Karon: They’ll all dress it up as, oh, this will be good for the game. But it’s all about two rival business centres competing for this prize. The political analogy, comparing the World Cup to the Champions League, think about the United Nations General Assembly. Hypothetically, that is the most representative body in terms of world politics, it would be, you would think, the pinnacle of global governance. And yet, we all know that the UNGA is almost entirely a symbolic venue and the power is in the hands of the UN Security Council, which includes, you know, the five unelected, permanent members who all have veto power, etc. In some ways that’s an analogy with where global football is right now, that the European clubs are the equivalent of the Security Council, perhaps without quite the veto power. There’s a bit more of a balance, but it’s that sort of distinction. .Malika Bilal: Tony, this is why we love having you on, because you can unite the political science nerds among our listeners with the football nerds, amongst our listeners and, and, and merge them together. Thank you for that insight. .  .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: We’ll hear more from Tony in a bit. But first, a dispatch from Doha, where Al Jazeera’s Sohail Malik has been watching tournament preparations take place for more than a decade. .Sohail Malik: I’m a sports reporter here working for Al Jazeera English in Qatar, been here for just under 20 years and super hyped about this competition that’s going to be happening in Qatar. We’re just gearing up for it every single day. The countdown is on. .Malika Bilal: And it’s a countdown nearly 12 years in the making. Sohail was at the Al Jazeera offices back in 2010, when FIFA revealed Qatar would be hosting. .Sohail Malik: What I remember was, that moment when Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, you know, he made the big announcement and he went, ‘Qatar!’ Wow. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Sohail Malik: For a split second, it was shock. For another split-second euphoria. And then the next split second, a massive eruption of people shouting in the newsroom. I haven’t heard a shout, a scream, a bit of cheering like that in this newsroom. I’ve been at Al Jazeera for, you know, 17 years, around. Nothing, nothing has made an eruption like that before. And it’s a building that’s not full of Qataris. It’s a very, multinational cosmopolitan place, the Al Jazeera newsroom. So, we’re talking mainly expats here. And that moment was a moment of celebration by a group of people that kind of felt that Qatar was now their home and they were taking part in it. And that’s what I remember this moment of overjoy that, uh, I’ve not come across since, since being in Al Jazeera for all those years more. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: After you left the newsroom, you could see the euphoria on the streets. That’s where I was that day. I remember it very vividly. I went to Katara, the cultural centre in Doha for the announcement. And it was pandemonium. I have never seen such excitement. And it was as though Qatar had won the actual World Cup and not just the bid to host it. .Sohail Malik: It was funny, you mentioned that, about it was like Qatar actually won it. In colloquial terms, when you talk to people at the time, people over here used to refer to it as “when Qatar won the World Cup”. It actually became, you know, a way how people used to express themselves at the time. Remember, this has never happened before, you know, a Middle Eastern country having the World Cup. .Malika Bilal: And that excitement was palpable that night. Here’s what one Qatari resident said. .Qatari resident: What happened today is only the beginning. We should double our efforts from now on. Hopefully, now we will all double our efforts as Arabs, Muslims and Qataris to organise a tournament that will be remembered for generations to come. .Sohail Malik: Already five, 10 minutes after the announcement, people were dashing to congregate at these places to celebrate. And I just remember, as soon as I left Al Jazeera, traffic had already started backing up. .Newsreel: Well, this is Doha’s main Corniche street. It’s actually a three-lane highway, but as you can see, no one is going anywhere.   .Malika Bilal: So that was 12 years ago. You’ve been in Doha ever since. What kind of changes have you noticed in Qatar since then? How has the landscape changed? How has security changed? How has life changed? .Sohail Malik: Every single day when I drive my car to work or I drive somewhere, it kind of feels like I’m seeing something new. You have those kind of places where it’s just for you and your friends. It’s a hidden gem. Right, they’re yours. That’s how Qatar was as a country before. Since then Qatar has just exploded. Especially since getting this World Cup, the landscape is completely different. Just look at the skyline of Qatar, where you see all the big buildings in the west bay area. I think since, in the last 10, 12 years, the number of buildings, I don’t know the exact figures, but it kind of looks like it’s doubled. .Malika Bilal: As Sohail tells it, Doha basically became a construction site once the hosting announcement was made. And it wasn’t just fancy skyrises popping up. .Sohail Malik: We used to have not the best roads you could say. Some of them were narrow. We had roundabouts, which used to maybe intimidate a lot of people that came to drive in Qatar. You probably remember them well. .Malika Bilal: Yes. You take your life into your hands at every roundabout. .Sohail Malik: Yeah. The road system here has completely been redeveloped. You’ve got a Metro system now as well. So, you know, the whole landscape and character of Qatar has changed. It’s a completely different place. .Malika Bilal: And has this been in preparation for the World Cup or is this separate? .Sohail Malik: It is a mix between both, because obviously, Qatar had much more grand visions beyond just hosting the World Cup. So whether the World Cup happened or not, there was always going to be mass development in Qatar. It’s a very ambitious country. Most of the things have come up, are going to benefit the World Cup, are going to make being at the World Cup better for the people coming. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Sohail Malik: But I just want to make it another point here. They’re not just building over here things that will be useless afterwards. When people come here, they’re going to be temporary accommodations that will be pretty much gone when the World Cup is over. If you look at the plan, there’s a traditional Arabian-style fan village, where people can choose to say if they want, it’s got those old-fashioned, Bedouin-style tents, which inside actually they’re pretty kitted out and pretty luxurious. And also, we’ve got cruise ships coming to Qatar that are going to be docked on the shore where fans can stay as well. So, there has been a fair bit of foresight not to be left with the city of white elephants after the tournament. .Malika Bilal: So finally, Sohail, as a resident of Doha, what do you hope that visitors might see, or might take away from this experience that they might not have expected? .Sohail Malik: I really want people to experience how the football culture is over here and a lot of it revolves around shisha, around hookah cafes. When there’s a big night and in the Champions League, or if Qatar are playing, you have to book a place literally in a shisha cafe, because it’s going to be wild. At the last World Cup, maybe it’s because of England’s history – I’m from England – history in the region, it is the most unpopular team, whenever there’s a World Cup. So, I remember last time when England went to the semi-finals, I was at these cafes most of the time and they played Colombia. I was literally on my own getting heckled the whole time by everyone. There were no Colombians in that cafe, but everyone became Colombian just in the hope that England go out. So, there’s always that banter. There’s always that commotion. So, I really hope people buy in and try to experience the local football culture. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: With all of the construction Sohail mentioned, there’s also been controversy. .Newsreel: Qatar’s World Cup in 2022 has thrown the spotlight on the welfare of those who are building the venues for football’s showpiece.  .Newsreel: Every knock alters Doha cityscape beam by beam. The country capital is growing on the backs of these men. Migrant workers who’ve left families and homes eager for opportunity.  .Newsreel: Criticism persists about the treatment of the army of migrant workers who have made this World Cup a reality. .Malika Bilal: Concerns about the conditions for the workers building the stadiums for the World Cup have cast a dark shadow on Qatar’s hosting. Here’s Tony Karon again, to break that down. .Tony Karon: We have seen for a number of years now that very credible international human rights and labour rights organisations have made extensive studies of conditions in Qatar and have produced reports. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Labour Organization would be three that come to mind that have detailed quite shocking experiences and abuses of the migrant labour workforce that has been building stadiums in Qatar. .Malika Bilal: It’s something Al Jazeera has documented as well; here’s what Deepak Biswas, an air conditioning fitter who came to Qatar from India, told the network back in 2012, as the construction boom took off. .Deepak Biswas: My family don’t know I live like this. They would worry about us. That’s why we don’t tell them. I paid the agent in India about $1,400 to come here. I’ve just finished paying the loan off, but have nothing left. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: So, World Cup stadiums are always built by migrant labour. Even within Brazil or within South Africa, it wasn’t as if this was like a neighbourhood workforce that turned its attention to this project, obviously. And the conditions of migrant labour in many countries, the power of those workers is much more limited by a virtue of being migrants. In the Gulf that’s been a much more intense problem. There isn’t much of an indigenous working class in the Gulf and the conditions in the region for migrant workers have been, ones that would not be acceptable in many parts of the world. Now the country authorities have acknowledged the problem. They have investigated over the years, responded to the investigations, passed new laws, promised, you know, to improve things. And I think by all accounts, there have been significant improvements relative to what had gone before and relative, perhaps to the norms of the Gulf. .Malika Bilal: Over the years, there have been protests, including by football players themselves. Here’s what Nasser Al Khater, the 2022 World Cup CEO, told Al Jazeera last year about those protests. .Nasser Al Khater: So people really need to see the amount of work that Qatar has put the progress it has made. They need to put it into context of the region and where Qatar stands in the region.  .Tony Karon: I don’t think this issue will disappear before the World Cup. I think if anything, we’re more likely to see it escalate. And I think you might see some concrete, demands being the focus of that kind of protest action, particularly, on the question of compensation to families whose loved ones died in the building of stadiums in Qatar. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Malika Bilal: You mentioned protest actions. At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, we saw protestors with the Russian feminist punk group, Pussy Riot run the field. .Newsreel: There was some unexpected drama on the soccer pitch at the World Cup final Moscow. And it had nothing to do with the game itself. .Newsreel: Four people charged the pitch all at the same time, about 52 minutes into the game. .Newsreel: One activist was able to give French star, Kylian Mbappe, a double high five. Another was less lucky, tackled by Croatian player Dejan Lovren. .Malika Bilal: They were protesting political rights in Russia. Are you expecting any protests or moments like that, which were definitely attention-grabbing, this time around? .Tony Karon: I would be shocked if there weren’t moments of protest. I mean, if you think about it, the World Cup gives you a captive audience of more than a billion people live in real-time. Given what we’ve seen already in terms of issues being raised about worker rights in Qatar, issues being raised about LGBTQ rights in Qatar, I think it’s certainly a safe bet that there will be some forms of action. You’ve even seen discussions, for example, the Qatari minister responsible for policing having to discuss, well, what will happen if somebody raised the rainbow flag in a stadium? And then, him saying, well, that would be confiscated. We don’t allow flags to be raised in stadiums. But you can see why any group that is needing to make a point will find it very tempting to do, because it’s a very difficult position for the host. Because whatever you do in response to some sort of protest creates its own momentum and creates its own set of issues. .Malika Bilal: So finally, Tony, we have talked about the importance of the World Cup being hosted in Qatar, but how much do you think location actually matters in the end? .Tony Karon: You’re reminding me of something that I began to think about after 2010. .[SOUND FROM 1950 WORLD CUP] .Tony Karon: And if you take the arc from the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, in Maracana stadium. It’s Brazil-Uruguay, Uruguay wins. It’s like a historic disaster in Brazilian culture. And, basically what’s interesting about that game is it’s an experience shared in real-time by a hundred thousand people, all of whom are inside the stadium. They’re physically present. Most of the world hears about what happened in that game, the following day. .Malika Bilal: But fast forward to 2014. .[SOUND FROM 2014 WORLD CUP] .Malika Bilal: The final was between Germany and Argentina. It took place in that very same stadium in Brazil. And this time, more than a billion people tuned in from around the world. .[MUSIC PLAYING] .Tony Karon: What satellite technology has done has made this an intimate, shared, real-time experience. And then if you look at the statistics on social media, like it’s the biggest single day of sharing, like billions and billions of interactions. So, this global electronic crowd sharing a real-time moment is also behaving like a crowd. They’re literally talking to one another on their devices. And I remember thinking to myself, after 2014, it’s like, if you imagine, you know, an era where there’s space tourism and you can create gravity, you could hold a World Cup in a spaceship and the world would still share it in the same way. Because for most of us, it’s a very real and vivid experience. We can recall minute by minute what’s happening, but you don’t have to be there. .Malika Bilal: And that’s The Take. We’re excited to share the world’s biggest sporting event with you, wherever you may be. You can reach out to us on Twitter and Instagram at AJE Podcasts, with what stories you’re looking at.

Golden boot: Ademir (Brazil) .After a gap of 12 years, the football World Cup returned for its fourth edition. .The destruction, tragedy and political turmoil caused by World War II took its toll on all European nations. In other parts of the world, the aftereffects were being felt too which is why it took FIFA time to find willing hosts. .South America, which had not hosted the tournament since the inaugural edition, made use of this opportunity and Brazil was selected to host its first World Cup. .Qualification for the tournament was complicated due to financial and political reasons. Defending champions Italy were in a crisis of their own as the Superga air disaster led to the death of some of Italy’s biggest football stars. The team eventually did participate but with a weakened squad. .History of the world cups: .How the football World Cup finally came about in 1930 .The controversies, shocks at the 1934 FIFA World Cup .FIFA World Cup 1938: Italy defend title before WWII breaks out .Other qualifiers, such as India and Turkey, withdrew citing financial and logistical reasons. .England, despite its football history, played its first World Cup after finally joining the governing body. .When the tournament finally kicked off, two groups comprised four teams, one group had three teams and one group had just two teams. .The group winners advanced to the finals round, where a round-robin format was in play to maximise the number of matches and ticket sales. .Brazil seemed firm favourites to win their last match over Uruguay and be crowned champions in front of nearly 200,000 home fans. A goal in the 47th minute put them ahead but Uruguay completed a comeback to score two goals in 13 minutes and leave the home fans stunned. .Uruguay became the second country to win the title for the second time after Italy. .After more than a decade of grief and war, the world saw some colour and celebration when Brazil put itself forward as the host and brought some joy to the world’s football fans for three weeks. .The host nation built a massive 200,000-capacity stadium, the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, which was packed for the final and other matches involving Brazil. .It was the first World Cup where the jerseys had numbers on their backs. .Argentina pulled out of the tournament citing disagreements with the Brazilian Football Confederation. .Several teams that were once considered powerhouses, such as Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, could not participate as they were still reeling from the effects of war. .There was no Asian team in the tournament.",675

678,Published On 20 Oct 2022,"Key questions answered, one month before World Cup 2022",Here is what you need to know as Qatar marks one month to go before kickoff.,".It has been 12 years since Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani lifted the Jules Rimet trophy following the announcement that Qatar would host football’s biggest event in 2022, the World Cup. .Thursday marks one month to go before kickoff in the opening game of the tournament. .Here is what you need to know about the event: .Originally scheduled to take place during June and July, the tournament was moved to Qatar’s winter season due to the extreme heat during the summer where temperatures often exceed 40C (113F). .It does mean that some of the world’s top leagues will be put on hold for the tournament. But, according to David Beckham, a Qatar 2022 ambassador, the timing will have benefits. .“I was lucky enough to play in three World Cups and I know that I went into each one of those World Cups playing probably 50 to 60 games in the season,” Beckham told Al Jazeera in Doha. “Players are coming into this World Cup after playing 25 games. So they will be arriving fresh and excited. Their energy is going to be at the top level, so I think what you’re going to see on the pitch is probably like no other World Cup.” .Vaccination is not mandatory for fans to enter Qatar for the World Cup. However, they will need to show a negative COVID test and then download a contact-tracing phone app called Ehteraz. .A Hayya card works as a fan ID. .It is a personalised document (accessed via an app too after logging in) issued to every ticket-holder and will need to be shown to get into any of the World Cup stadiums. .It also works as an entry permit to Qatar and will also allow holders to use public transport free of charge during the tournament. Hayya cardholders will be allowed to stay in Qatar until January 23, and will also act as a multiple-use entry visa for tourists visiting the UAE. .Eight stadiums will host matches during Qatar’s 2022 World Cup. .Thirty-two teams will fight it out in groups of four for the first 12 days of the competition, kicking off on November 20. The top two from each of the eight groups will go through to the knock-out rounds, with the final taking place on December 18. .Group A: Netherlands, Senegal, Ecuador, Qatar .Group B: England, USA, Iran, Wales .Group C: Argentina, Mexico, Poland, Saudi Arabia .Group D: France, Denmark, Tunisia, Australia .Group E: Spain, Germany, Japan, Costa Rica .Group F: Belgium, Croatia, Morocco, Canada .Group G: Brazil, Switzerland, Serbia, Cameroon .Group H: Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay, South Korea .A total of 3,010,679 tickets were made available, with organisers last month that more than 2.85 million had been snapped up since going on sale. .Qatar, Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States are the leading countries of residence for those purchasing match tickets. .Qatar residents were able to buy tickets for as little as 40 Qatari riyals ($11). If you were lucky enough to get a ticket to the final, you could expect to pay up to 6,000 riyals ($1,607). .More than 1.2 million fans are expected to travel to Qatar for the tournament. .In March, organisers launched an online accommodation portal, prioritising match ticket holders. .Apartments, hotel rooms, desert camping, villas, fan villages – and even cabins on moored cruise ships have been made available. .However, fans will also be able to stay in neighbouring countries and fly in for the matches or drive to the Saudi-Qatar border and use a free bus service to reach Doha city centre. .Concerns over shortage of accommodation have grown and, in September, the government ruled that local residents would be able to rent out their homes to World Cup fans through the tournament. .Iran, on the other side of the Gulf from Qatar, has also been working to ease visas and travel restrictions to allow World Cup fans to base themselves there. .Nasser al-Khater, chief executive of the 2022 World Cup, has said that “everyone is welcome” in Qatar. .“Public displays of affection are frowned upon here, but that applies to everyone,” said al-Khater. “I would like to assure any fan of any gender orientation, religion or race to rest assured that Qatar is one of the safest countries in the world and that they will all be welcomed here.” .Alcohol will be available in hotel bars and selected fan zones. It will also be available in the hospitality areas of the stadiums. For permanent residents with a special permit from their employer, purchase can be made from one of the two liquor stores in the country. .It is not just the World Cup that’s kicking off this winter in Qatar. The country plans to treat its visitors with entertainment across the board. .Qatar’s regular police and security services are drawn from many nations, just like much of the rest of its population. .In addition, Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said the country would send 3,250 security officers to Qatar for the World Cup. NATO has also said it would support the security operation. .Pakistan is set to send troops to help provide security, while South Korea is also sending counterterrorism specialists to assist Qatari military police. .Yes. For starters, the 2022 World Cup will introduce a radical new semi-automated offside detection system. The new technology, trialled at the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi and at the Arab Cup in Qatar, utilises a limb-tracking camera system to track player movements and a sensor in the ball. It then quickly shows 3D images on stadium screens at the tournament to help fans understand the referee’s call. .Each stadium in Qatar will have 12 cameras beneath the roof, synchronised to track 29 data points on each player’s body 50 times per second. Data is processed with artificial intelligence to create a 3D offside line that is alerted to the team of VAR officials.",678

682,Published On 19 Oct 2022,In the neighbourhood of former Indian footballer Bhaichung Bhutia,"In the 1990s and 2000s, Bhutia’s magic on the field brought the sport back into contention in the cricket-crazy country.",".Gangtok, Sikkim – On a cool monsoon morning, as a layer of mist hung over the lush hills in Gangtok, a group of young students wearing bright yellow, orange and green jerseys kicked about on the football pitch of the Tashi Namgyal Academy (TNA). .For Simon Subba, who often guides young footballers, the sight of a kickabout triggered a flood of memories. .“It used to be just sand here when we played. Now there is a good astroturf,” Subba recalled. .Nestled in a leafy part of the burgeoning hill station, TNA is the most prominent school in Gangtok. It is named after the eleventh ruler of the erstwhile Himalayan kingdom of Sikkim which became part of India in 1975. .The school is also known for its most notable alumnus – India’s star footballer Bhaichung Bhutia. The pavilion, where the parents sat watching their kids train, is named after him. .In this small state, surrounded by Bhutan and Tibet and with a population of about 600,000, Bhutia commands the status of a hero. .“For the football enthusiasts, he is a hero,” an academic, who wished to remain anonymous, explained as he sipped beer at a Gangtok pub. .There are many such pubs on this road which serves as the commercial centre of the city. It is the best-known part of Gangtok and is popular equally with tourists and locals. .In the last 15 years, small shops of yore have given way to big restaurants and hotels. .A red panda statue, the state animal of Sikkim, at one end of the road and that of Mahatma Gandhi on the other welcome the visitors. .“People of Sikkim remember and respect him as someone who put the small state on the national map with his incredible game,” the academic added as he meandered to Bhutia’s foray into politics. .Bhutia is now trying to find his feet in politics. He first contested Lok Sabha – the national elections – in 2014 from Darjeeling in the neighbouring West Bengal state. He then contested state elections from Siliguri, also in West Bengal. He ended up winning neither. .In 2018, Bhutia made forays into politics in Sikkim and formed his own political party called Hamro Sikkim Party (Our Sikkim Party). He contested elections in 2019 but lost again. .In the 1990s and 2000s, Bhutia’s magic on the field brought football back into contention in the cricket-crazy country. .In a long international career, from 1995 to 2011, much of which was spent leading the Indian team, he became the first footballer to play 100 matches for India and the first to sign a contract with a European club. .His exploits, like the 1997 Federation Cup semi-final, where he became the first player to score a hat-trick in the Kolkata derby when East Bengal trounced Mohun Bagan 4-1, won him the title of Sikkimese sniper. .Subba, a professional footballer during his youth, was Bhutia’s contemporary at the TNA. .“He was two years senior to me,” Subba said, pointing to a yellow building with a green roof on the other side of the pitch. “That’s the hostel where we lived.” .Born in a family of farmers in south Sikkim’s Tinkitam village, Bhutia was always passionate about football. .“The family used to grow ginger on a farm. He once told me how he used to sell his share of ginger at a local market and then buy football with it,” Subba recalled. .When Bhutia was growing up, the roads in rural Sikkim were either non-existent or in a bad shape. Quality education was not available. .Those with means would go to boarding schools in Gangtok or Darjeeling. That is why Bhutia landed up in Pakyong, a town 25km (15.5 miles) from Gangtok. .Pakyong is now home to the small state’s only civilian airport, counted among the world’s most beautiful ones where the rare flight landings are only on days when the weather is kind. The town also hosts a national orchid research centre and one of Sikkim’s well-known educational institutions – St Xavier’s School – where Bhutia first studied after he stepped out of Tinkitam. .“Bhaichung was a terrific goal scorer even when he was at St Xavier’s,” recounted Devendra Gurung, a Gangtok-based politician who was with Bhutia at Xavier’s and refers to him as one of his oldest friends. .Around India’s Independence Day celebrations on August 15, every small town and village hosts football tournaments. For Gurung and Bhutia, these tournaments translated into dozens of goals. .“Whenever we were playing [for the school team], the score used to be 23-0, 24-0 in our favour. And most goals would be scored by Bhaichung,” Gurung said. .But the goals did not come easy. The two would wake up early to train. While Bhutia lived in a room below the school building, Gurung’s hostel was above it. .“I would tell Bhaichung to sleep on the bunk bed close to the window so that it’s easy to knock from outside and wake him up,” Gurung said. .The two friends studied in Pakyong until grade six when they were among the five students chosen by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) for football training. .They were then sent to TNA, which had been adopted by SAI with sports coaches posted there. Bhutia’s love for football grew once he was at TNA. .“Often, I would find him kicking the ball all by himself,” Gurung said. .Subba, too, remembered Bhutia playing football all the time. .“When everyone was studying, Bhaichung would be still on the field,” Subba recalled, adding how Bhutia would be the last to leave the pitch for the evening preparatory lectures. .But in school, Bhutia was good at not just football. .“Except swimming, he was part of all sports teams,” said Pushkar Khatiwara, another TNA alumnus, as he watched his child train on the astroturf. “Bhaichung always gave his 100 per cent.” .“He was an all-rounder, except in studies,” Sherap Lepcha, manager at the Deltin Denzong casino in Gangtok, joked. .Lepcha, who was among the five kids chosen by SAI, recalled their coach at the school would go plead to other teachers on behalf of Bhutia and him to ensure that they were given the minimum passing grade. .“Bhaichung had extra talent. He has a natural gift,” said Karma Bhutia, a retired football administrator who was instrumental in helping Bhutia, Lepcha and others get a foothold in professional football. .After returning to Sikkim in 1978, Karma, then employed with the Public Works Department, started The Boys Club. It was in the late 1980s that Karma noticed Bhaichung, Sherap and Devendra at the TNA. .“I used to keep going there and watch them play,” Karma said. .He is the one who chose Bhutia for the Sikkim senior football team and later pushed him to join the East Bengal club in Kolkata. .“Karma sir turned out to be a godfather-like figure for us,” Lepcha said. “He is the one who did everything for us. When Bhaichung and I left our small villages to study, we barely had any money.” .Lepcha comes from a family of farmers in Dzongu, a scenic valley in North Sikkim reserved for the Lepcha people, a mostly Buddhist Indigenous group in Sikkim and Nepal. .During short vacations, going home was not an option due to limited finances. They would either stay at the hostel or go to Karma or Devendra Gurung’s house. .“This is where we would kick around during vacations,” said Subba, who lives a short distance from Gurung’s then-residence, pointing to the road outside his house in the Development Colony neighbourhood of the city. .The street is now a row of houses, shops and ATMs and is usually teeming with cars, scooters and pedestrians except for a small opening where one can get an occasional view of Kangchendzonga mountain. .“It used to be empty those days,” Subba said. .“The city was very different then,” said Lepcha. .The hill station, now a major tourist destination, is expanding to cater to visitors. Many from the state’s rural areas, too, have moved to the city for better opportunities. On a normal day, the city is chockablock with traffic and tourists. .“It is a concrete jungle now,” Lepcha rues as he ate at the Deltin Denzong’s restaurant which offers a panoramic view of the centre of Gangtok city. .Besides football, it is the love for momos and thukpa that kept the group together. .The students on the SAI scholarship received 50 Indian rupees [then $3.5] a month from the school. All of that would be spent eating thukpa, momos and chowmein at the Lhakpa Hotel, near the Paljor stadium in Gangtok, where they would go and play the tournaments. .The stadium, currently under renovation, is also the home ground for United Sikkim FC, the club founded by Bhutia. .“We played for thukpa and momos those days,” Lepcha said. .The group of friends used to have bets on eating and the one who would eat the least would have to pay. .“Bhaichung never ended up paying,” Gurung recalled as he burst into laughter. .Even these days, when Bhutia visits Lepcha at the restaurant and the casino, he tells him in advance to keep the momos ready. .“He still loves food,” Lepcha said. The two have remained close friends. Both their teenage sons also play football and go to the same school in Siliguri city run by Bhutia. .“He is still in touch with all his friends. As is he is growing old, he has only grown more humble” Lepcha said.",682

The finalists of the first World Cup believed that tournament hosting rights should be alternated between Europe and South America. .Despite this controversy, Brazil and Cuba ensured the continent’s representation, with the former showing the first glimpse of flamboyance and flair that would be associated with them in the years to follow. .Austria, meanwhile, was abolished months prior to the tournament and was annexed into Germany. .This led to alleged rifts within the German squad and distress among some spectators during Germany’s games. .History of the world cups .How the football World Cup finally came about in 1930 .The controversies, shocks at the 1934 FIFA World Cup .The Italian team caused controversy as well by making fascist salutes before kickoff and choosing to wear black as their away shirt, in line with the Fascist Party’s colours. .The Italians stamped their authority on the competition by becoming the first team to successfully defend its title. .Italy’s Vittorio Pozzo would write his name among the first legendary coaches of the game as he led the Azzurri to their second consecutive world title, as well as an Olympic gold medal in 1936. .Asia was represented in the tournament for the first time as Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, qualified while other Asian teams withdrew. .The tournament saw an average of 4.66 goals per match much to the delight of the spectators across the 10 host cities. .Six games went into extra time as penalty shootouts had not been introduced yet. .The tournament was marred by political unease across Europe, as well as continental unease between South America and Europe. .It led to several big football nations missing out on the tournament. .The third World Cup turned out to be the last in the pre-World War II era.

Golden boot: Oldrich Nejedly .With the foundation laid four years ago in Uruguay, FIFA decided to host the second edition of the World Cup in Europe. .Italy was chosen as the host but had to ensure participation by becoming the only host nation to play qualifiers. .It was joined by 32 other teams in the qualifying round, of which 16 proceeded to the main event. .In another first and only instance in a FIFA World Cup, holders Uruguay pulled out of the tournament to protest against most European teams’ absence from the 1930 World Cup it hosted. .Argentina and Brazil were the only South American teams to qualify for the tournament but failed to progress and the quarterfinals turned out to be an all-European affair. .The matches were spread across eight Italian cities with the final in Rome. The tightly contested final went into extra time, where star forward Angelo Schiavio scored within five minutes to complete a comeback win for the hosts. .Following the popularity of the first World Cup, FIFA acted swiftly to schedule the second edition and was able to rope in big names from Europe. .The qualification structure, spreading out of matches to different cities and third-place playoff were some of the key moves that FIFA would continue in the tournaments to come. .It was the first time that the tournament was broadcast live on radio in 12 of the 16 participating countries. .Luis Monti, who was part of the 1930 runners-up Argentina won the title with his newly adopted country Italy. He is the only player to have represented two countries in a World Cup final. .The tournament was held in Italy during the reign of Benito Mussolini and his fascist party. .Several allegations were made against the leader and his party related to corruption and the use of influence to favour the host nation. .The quarterfinal between Italy and Spain was marred by on-field fights, controversy and delays. It was finally settled by a replay.",686
687,Published On 11 Oct 2022,Eight teams that have missed out on this year’s FIFA World Cup,"From Italy to Egypt, here are the eight teams that have missed out on a spot at the FIFA World Cup.",".Even before the first kick of the ball at the Qatar 2022 World Cup, fans who have not been following the tournament qualifiers will be in for a shock: Current European champions and four-time World Cup winners Italy will not be among the participants. .While its failure to qualify has caused the side some embarrassment, it is not the only big name missing from the Qatar 2022 roster. .Some other big teams from Europe, South America and Africa will also watch the tournament from home. .Here is a look at some of those sides who will not be on the plane to Qatar in November: .Ranking: 6 .Best show at World Cup: Winners (1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006) .Italy missed out on securing a spot after a 92nd-minute loss to North Macedonia in their playoff semifinal in March. The fact that they were in the playoffs was surprising as well, given their Euro 2020 triumph last year and a string of good results in the qualifying rounds preceding the tournament. .In the next five matches, however, they won just once and were held to four draws. A second-place finish behind Switzerland took them to the playoffs where they failed to score and found themselves missing out on the World Cup for the second consecutive time. .Ranking: 17 .Best show at World Cup: Quarter-finals (2014) .Boasting a former World Cup Golden Boot winner, James Rodriguez, and impressive performances at the last two editions of the tournament, Colombia were one of the favourites to secure a spot at Qatar 2022. .The South American side finished sixth in the CONMEBOL qualifiers, a point behind Peru who took the playoff spot after the top four teams earned automatic qualification. .Rodriguez, who played club football in Qatar for one year, shared his disappointment and said he was “in deep pain” in a long social media post after his team failed to qualify. .Ranking: 20 .Best show at World Cup: Runners-up (1958) .Sweden have been part of 12 of the 21 world cups. The country hosted the tournament in 1958 when the team recorded its best result by reaching the final where it lost a high-scoring match again Brazil. .The 2018 quarter-finalists’ journey to Qatar was derailed when they lost three of their six matches in the second leg of qualifiers last year. They ended up second in their group behind Spain and were pitted against Poland in the playoffs. .The playoff tie was held in Poland and the home team took full advantage of the support by winning 2-0 and ending the youthful Swedish side’s dreams of making it to Qatar. .Ranking: 29 .Best show at World Cup: Third place (1962) .Chile have been present at the World Cup since the first edition in 1930. They hosted the tournament in 1962 and finished third. .In recent editions (1998, 2010 and 2014), Chile reached the round-of-16 stage. Those performances came with players like Arturo Vidal, Gary Medel and Alexis Sanchez. With the waning form of these players, Chile have it difficult to get favourable results. .They won only one of their last four qualification matches for Qatar 2022. Chile then sought to have Ecuador disqualified by arguing that Ecuador’s Byron Castillo was Colombian and ineligible to represent Ecuador. .FIFA, however, declared that the player held permanent Ecuadorian nationality and was eligible to represent the country in accordance with the rules. .Ranking: 31 .Best show at World Cup: Round of 16 (1994, 1998, 2014) .Nigeria made its debut at the World Cup in 1994 and became an instant hit with the fans due to their attacking style of play and entertaining goal celebrations. .The Super Eagles topped their group but got knocked out of the tournament in the round of 16 after a stunning comeback by Italy led by Roberto Baggio. .Since then, the Super Eagles have only missed out on the 2006 tournament before making another comeback when the World Cup was played in South Africa four years later. .This time around, Nigeria’s dreams of playing in front of a large expat Nigerian population were dashed when they drew both their playoff legs against Ghana. The second leg of the tie saw Ghana qualify for Qatar on the basis of an away goal. .Russia .Ranking: 35 .Best show at World Cup: Fourth (1966 as Soviet Union), quarter-finals (2018) .The only politically forced expulsion from the 2022 World Cup is Russia. FIFA announced the team’s expulsion from all competitions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. .Russia was one of the favourites to qualify from Europe and build on its run at the 2018 edition where it reached the quarter-finals. Russia filed an appeal against the ban in the Court of Arbitration of Sport but later withdrew it. .The team’s history at the World Cup is split into two.

Three years later, it becomes an official FIFA member. .1970 – The national team plays its first official match against Bahrain in the biennial Gulf Cup, losing 2-1. .1972 – The QFA launches the Qatar football league. .1974 – Qatar win their first international match, beating Oman 4-0 in the second group game of the Gulf Cup.

689,Published On 6 Oct 2022,Saudi fan walking across desert to reach FIFA World Cup in Qatar,Abdullah Alsulmi is walking from Jeddah to Doha to attend Saudi Arabia’s opening game against Argentina in November.,".The idea hit Abdullah Alsulmi earlier this year, while he was watching a television show in which a senior Qatari official promised an “exceptional” experience at the upcoming World Cup. .His excitement building, the 33-year-old Saudi trekker recalls thinking: “I will go to Doha no matter what, even if I have to walk!” .It was an unlikely beginning to what has become an audacious adventure dismissed by some of Alsulmi’s relatives as “crazy”: a two-month, 1,600-kilometre (1,000-mile) solo trek from his native Jeddah to the Qatari capital. .Alsulmi says the journey, faithfully documented for his thousands of Snapchat followers, is meant to highlight regional enthusiasm for the first World Cup in the Middle East – which Saudi officials have pitched as a milestone “for all Arabs”. .“We want to support the World Cup,” Alsulmi said last week as he sheltered from the midday sun near roadside shrubs in the town of al-Khasrah, 340 kilometres southwest of Riyadh. .Wearing a wide-brim hat and a backpack to which he has affixed Saudi Arabian and Qatari flags, he said: “I consider myself like a Qatari who is very interested in this World Cup and its success.” .Alsulmi has experience with extended treks in Canada and Australia, where he used to live, yet those pale in comparison to the rigours of traversing the Arabian Peninsula. .He typically sets out at sunrise and walks until 10 or 10:30am, but then the heat forces him to break for a few hours before resuming in the afternoon and continuing until sundown. .Occasionally he walks at night to maintain his goal of around 35 kilometres per day. .To keep his load light, Alsulmi subsists on food he can buy at petrol stations, often chicken and rice, while showering and washing his clothes at mosques. .His social media posts capture details of life on the trail, from the mundane to the menacing: his nightly search for a spot to sleep, and the time he eyed a scorpion dozing dangerously close to his tent. .He also records conversations with Saudis he meets along the way, many of whom offer snacks and juice to keep him going. .“There are moments of ups and downs, but when I meet people and hear these sweet words – ‘We will follow you on your account and support you’ – this encourages me to finish,” he said. .Straying from the main roads as often as he can, he says he has been rewarded with a taste of the varied scenery on offer in the kingdom – something he did not fully appreciate before. .“Walking from Jeddah to Doha, every 100 kilometres is different. I mean, the first 100 kilometres there are sand dunes, then mountains, and then comes empty land, then farms,” he said. .“I am going through all terrains in one country in two months. This is a beautiful thing.” .Alsulmi hopes that by posting about his experience, he can inspire other Saudis to consider trekking through their homeland. .“When I do this, I want to convey to people that hiking and walking is a beautiful sport, even if the weather is difficult here in Saudi Arabia, even if the terrain is difficult. We can do it,” he said. .“It is a sport for simple people. You only need a bag and a few simple things, and a tent and nature.” .If all goes according to plan, Alsulmi will arrive in Doha in time for Saudi Arabia’s opening showdown against Argentina on November 22. .It will be a moment of divided loyalty, since Argentina is his favourite team. .Four days later, he has a ticket for the Green Falcons’ match against Poland. .His hopes are high for a Saudi squad that has now qualified for six World Cups but advanced to the knockout stage just once, during its 1994 debut. .“This year we have good players. The coach is the great French coach [Herve] Renard,” he said. .“We expect and hope that this year the team will deliver an exceptional performance.”",689
690,Published On 4 Oct 2022,A mid-season World Cup will produce better football: Beckham,Former England captain tells Al Jazeera the event taking place in November and December will be beneficial for players.,".Doha, Qatar – Holding the World Cup in November and December during the world’s top league’s mid-season will produce a higher level of football compared with previous World Cups, according to former England captain David Beckham. .This year’s tournament kicks off in Qatar on November 20, with the final taking place on December 18. .The tournament was moved to Qatar’s winter period due to the extreme heat during its summer where temperatures often exceed 40C (113F). .While it means some of the world’s top leagues will be put on hold for the tournament, Beckham, who is also a Qatar 2022 ambassador, believes the timing will have benefits. .“I was lucky enough to play in three World Cups and I know that I went into each one of those World Cups playing probably 50 to 60 games in the season,” Beckham told Al Jazeera in Doha. .“Players are coming into this World Cup after playing 25 games. So they will be arriving fresh and excited. Their energy is going to be at the top level, so I think what you’re going to see on the pitch is probably like no other World Cup.” .The Manchester United legend also believes the compact nature of the event will be beneficial. .Qatar is a vastly smaller country compared with previous hosts like Russia, Brazil and South Africa, with 55km (34 miles) being the longest distance between two stadiums. .“It’s the dream for players. In previous World Cups we’ve had to travel and it’s not easy to recover after games,” said the six-time English Premier League winner. “I would have loved to have played at this World Cup.” .While he did not want to predict the winners, he has backed England to do well and is hoping Qatar will put on a good show when they make their tournament debut. .“It’s always great to see the host nation do well. Qatar have got a very good young team that have been together for a long time. So it would be good for the hosts to do well for the country and for the region.” .The World Cup 2022 kicks off with the hosts taking on Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium. It is the first World Cup in the Middle East.",690

692,Published On 3 Oct 2022,"Who is Captain Tsubasa, a hero to Spanish footballers?",How a Japanese cartoon character created in 1981 became a hero for Spanish footballers growing up.,".Spanish football fans may speak their regional bias when asked for their favourite players. .The Catalans might say Andrés Iniesta or David Villa, and the Madrileños, Iker Casillas or Fernando Torres. .The players, however, may tell you that their hero is not a former Spanish player or even a real person. .He’s the fictional, 11-year-old Japanese boy named Tsubasa. .“Captain Tsubasa” (known as “Oliver y Benji”, “Olive et Tom”, “Supercampeones”, or “Captain Majid” in other parts of the world), is a manga series first published in 1981 by Japanese animator Yōichi Takahashi. .The series tells the story of Ozora Tsubasa (Oliver Atom) who dreams of becoming a professional footballer. .His journey begins on an elementary school’s football pitch in Japan and takes him to São Paulo – the show is very popular in Brazil – and Barcelona before the World Cup. .The TV anime series was launched in 1983. Known for its unrealistic but jaw-dropping, and sometimes episodes-long, kicks, the series has sold more than 80 million copies worldwide. Over the years, it’s been transformed into 15 serialised mangas, nearly 20 video games, five television series and four films. .Many Spanish footballing legends – including Iniesta, Torres, Villa – and others from around the world like Lukas Podolski, Alessandro Del Piero, and Alexis Sanchez, have publicly traced their love of the game back to watching Tsubasa as kids. .“I started playing football because of this… I loved the cartoon. I wanted to be Oliver,” Torres has said in the past. .Torres and Villa, after starring for years in Europe, incidentally finished their careers in Japan. .Podolski had a stint at the Japanese club Vissel Kobe. .“Captain Tsubasa has always been one of my biggest inspirations since I was a kid. It’s an honour to support Japanese football manga and that unique culture,” Podolski said. .Today, Iniesta is Vissel Kobe’s captain. .So how did a child comic character from a football-indifferent 1980s Japan become the inspiration for future stars in an already football-crazed Spain? .Japan and Spain carry very different weights on the global football stage. .While Japan has elevated itself into a consistent qualifier for the men’s World Cups over the last two decades – its women’s side was world champions in 2011 – Spain is a powerhouse and won the competition in 2010, as well as the Euros in 2008 and 2012. .Football was introduced to the two countries at the same time, in the 1870s. .In Japan, a British Royal Navy officer named Archibald Lucius Douglas taught his students the sport while working at the Japanese Navy Academy in Tokyo. .In Spain, football was popularised by migrant workers from the UK and Spanish students who had learned to play while on exchange in the UK. .Japan hosted its first official match in 1888 with Spain’s taking place two years later. .But in the run-up to the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, Spain decided to build its first national team, while Japan waited until a decade later and football’s trajectory in the two countries began to deviate. .By the late 1970s, they stood on completely different levels. Japan had not managed to qualify for the World Cup since the team’s creation in 1930, while Spain had qualified four times, including a fourth-place finish in 1950. .Inspired by watching the 1978 World Cup in Argentina on television, Japanese animator Takahashi decided he wanted that to change. .“I thought football was very interesting and wanted to see it become a popular sport in Japan. I wanted the national football team to become stronger. In that sense, I wrote this book for the Japanese audience, explaining football in more detail,” Takahashi told Al Jazeera. .He began to create the cast of characters who would eventually become Captain Tsubasa, his friends and their opponents. .Bringing football to life in a country where it had existed for about 100 years but hadn’t found its footing would be no easy task. .“Football was not so popular in Japan. But in the rest of the world, it has already taken root, and people have been exposed to football culture since they were small children,” Takahashi added. .Little did he know that his work would inspire not only children in Japan but a whole new generation of players in Spain as well. .Until 1983, the Spanish government had operated only two central television channels and in 1990, three commercial channels were launched. .One of those was Tele5 which, after seeing Captain Tsubasa’s success in Japan, decided to bring the show to Spain. Captain Tsubasa was rebranded as “Oliver y Benji” and appeared for the first time on Spanish TV later that year. .Didier Montes, a sports communications professional who created a viral Twitter thread about Captain Tsubasa, said a decision by Tele5 executive Antonio Pusueco was key to the show’s success. .“Usually cartoons would be on TV on weekend mornings or after school. But he thought about when kids would be at home and decided to take the risk and air Tsubasa right before dinner, competing with the news,” Montes told Al Jazeera. .The experiment was a success. A 1990 article from El Pais listed viewership at a significant 26.3 percent of the national audience after only two months. .“When we were kids, if you didn’t watch Tsubasa the night before, you couldn’t play with us at school the next day. You wouldn’t know about the latest new shot that Tsubasa had made,” Montes said. .Years later, some of these children became the world’s most successful footballers, and often talk about Captain Tsubasa’s role in their love for the beautiful game. .Iniesta, Vissel Kobe captain, was an honoured guest at the inauguration of a Tsubasa-themed train station in Tokyo. .“I remember the characters’ unique playing styles, and am happy to be playing in Japan, where the anime was made,” he has said in the past. .Until 2020, Villa also played for the same side. .Luca Caioli, a sports journalist and author of Torres, a biography on the former Spain striker, said the show was important to “El Niño” at an early age. .“All his friends that I talked to remember, and can sing, the jingle [to Captain Tsubasa]. When you’re five or six, you need a hero, and once you have one, you follow it,” Caioli told Al Jazeera. .Years later, knowing of Torres’ devotion to the show, the president of Sagan Tosu (a J1 team) came to Madrid to meet him while the striker was at Atletico Madrid. .At their meeting, he presented the Spaniard with a drawing of Captain Tsubasa standing alongside an animated version of Torres, signed by Takahashi himself. .Torres ended up finishing his career with Sagan Tosu. .Captain Tsubasa has continued to inspire Spaniards, even those who didn’t grow up watching it during its initial TV run. .Takahashi said the show’s popularity can partly be attributed to the prevalence of reruns. .“It has been aired more often overseas than in Japan, so I think that the players of the Iniesta generation, as well as the members of the current generation, were influenced by the animation when they were children. I heard that when the World Cup or Euro starts, Captain Tsubasa starts re-airing in Europe so I think this cyclical exposure has been crucial to its popularity,” he told Al Jazeera. .Mauro Bravo, a 22-year-old Spaniard who plays in the United States for Major League Soccer’s Orlando City, has a tattoo of Tsubasa performing one of his iconic far-fetched, backwards, overhead kicks covering his thigh. .“My family taught me to love football, but it was [Captain Tsubasa] that made me passionate about it.” .With players of his generation, it’s still very common to have watched the show growing up, Bravo said. His devotion to the show is not only rooted in a love for the sport but what he’s learned from watching it. .“It teaches you valuable lessons for life, like sportsmanship, dedication, and how to be a good teammate.” .Gen-Z star and France’s World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe wears Captain Tsubasa merchandise and recently met with Takahashi after he was written into a new iteration of the manga. .Earlier this year, Mbappe even published his autobiography in graphic novel form. .In 2018, the first season of the show was rebooted, using modern anime design, in the run-up to the Russia World Cup. A basic search on TikTok shows more than 458 million views of Tsubasa-related content. On YouTube, the most viewed Tsubasa-related video has more than 14 million views. .Captain Tsubasa’s influence on football entertainment culture remains unmatched. Journalist Caioli said the only thing that comes close – but still a distant second – is the 2002 football film Bend It Like Beckham, which did wonders for promoting the women’s game. .On December 1, Japan and Spain will take on each other in Group E of the World Cup in Qatar, the first time the two sides meet in a competitive fixture. .“We are the last [in our group] to play Spain. I’m hoping we draw and go to the next round together,” Takahashi said. .“I think Spain is better than us in terms of ability, but football is a sport where anything can happen, so I think it is possible for us to win.”",692

Please click here to view the latest travel requirements for World Cup 2022 in effect from November 1. .Football fans heading to Qatar for the World Cup, due to start on November 20, must show a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country, organisers have confirmed. .All visitors over the age of 18 must also download Ehteraz, a contact-tracing, government-run phone application that tracks people’s movements and infection status. .“A green Ehteraz (showing the user does not have a confirmed case of COVID-19) is required to enter any public closed indoor spaces,” World Cup organisers said in a statement on Thursday. .Before travelling to Qatar, visitors entering the country will need to show a negative result from a PCR test taken in the 48 hours before arriving or from an official rapid test taken within 24 hours. .The testing policy, which applies to visitors aged six and older, is “regardless of the individual’s vaccination status”, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said. .Vaccination is not mandatory for the 1.2 million people expected to visit Qatar for the sporting event, which ends on December 18. No quarantine is necessary. .Rapid antigen tests taken in the previous 24 hours before landing in Qatar will only be accepted if they are from official medical centres and not self-administered, organisers said. No further tests are required in Qatar if fans do not develop symptoms of COVID-19. .Masks must be worn on public transport, including the metro system that many fans are expected to use to get to the eight stadiums in and around the capital, Doha. .Qatar has recorded nearly 450,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 682 deaths from the disease, according to data gathered since 2020 by Johns Hopkins University in the United States. .More than 97 percent of the population in Qatar – estimated to be at least 2.5 million, with about 350,000 of them being Qatari citizens – has had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the data. .World Cup organisers said that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 while in the country “will be required to isolate in accordance with Ministry of Public Health guidelines”.",693
694,Published On 28 Sep 2022,Brazil’s Richarlison demands action after banana thrown at match,Brazilian footballer Richarlison subjected to racist abuse during a friendly game in Paris against Tunisia.,".Brazilian footballer Richarlison de Andrade has responded angrily to racist abuse after he scored a goal for his country in a friendly game against Tunisia in Paris before the 2022 FIFA World Cup. .Richarlison was pelted with objects from the stands including a banana and plastic cups after he celebrated scoring in the 5-1 victory over Tunisia in front of its supporters during the match on Tuesday. .He responded to the incident by calling for the responsible parties to be punished. .“As long as you continue to ‘blah blah blah’ and don’t punish, it will continue like this, happening every day and in every corner. No time left, man!” Richarlison tweeted in Portuguese. . .The Tunisian Football Federation (FTF) said that it “strongly condemns” any racist act in stadiums but added it was not certain a Tunisia fan had thrown the banana. .Brazil midfielder Fred – Frederico Rodrigues de Paula Santos – kicked the banana off the pitch before extra security guards took up residence on the side of the field. .“Unfortunately … a banana was thrown on the pitch towards Richarlison, scorer of the second Brazilian goal,” the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said on Twitter, including a photograph of the banana lying by the touchline. .“The CBF reinforces its position to combat racism and repudiates any prejudiced act.” . .The head of the CBF, Ednaldo Rodrigues, said he was “shocked” by the incident and called for stricter measures to be introduced against racism globally. .“We must always remember that we are all the same, no matter what colour, race, or religion. Fighting racism is not a cause; it is a fundamental change to sweep this type of crime from the entire planet. I insist on saying that the punishments need to be more severe,” Rodrigues said. .Another Brazil scorer, Pedro (Pedro Guilherme Abreu dos Santos), responded to more boos and missiles from the crowd by bowing in front of them in celebration. .“It’s a shame, it’s difficult to see images like that,” said Brazil captain Thiago Silva, whose team posed for a group photo before the match with a banner bearing an anti-racism message. .“Unfortunately it seems that we can’t change people’s mentality. .“I hope they will realise that this doesn’t work, it’s the past, we have to change. Unfortunately, people continue with this mentality.” .The FTF stressed in its statement that “the overwhelming majority” of Tunisian fans at the match had behaved in an “exemplary manner” and that if it turns out that a Tunisian threw the banana, “we would apologise on his behalf and on behalf of all Tunisians present at the stadium”, said the statement. .Another Brazil star, Vinicius Junior, was the target of racist chants earlier this month when Real Madrid visited neighbours Atletico Madrid. Spanish prosecutors have opened an investigation. .In 2019, FIFA introduced tougher sanctions against racism and any form of discrimination as it is still one of the major global problems in sports.",694

Consequently, “it is still trying to capitalise on the World Cup and how better to do that than with a bit of panda diplomacy”, said Al Jazeera’s Patrick Fok, reporting from Beijing. .Suhail is the name of one of the brightest stars visible in the Gulf region, while Soraya is the Arabic name for the Pleiades star cluster.",695

697,Published On 27 Sep 2022,How samovar tea is warming hearts in Qatar,"Fresh, milky samovar tea is giving its more established brother, the evaporated-milk karak, a run for its money.",".Doha, Qatar – Mohammed Ali, a restaurateur in Qatar’s capital Doha, tells a story about a female customer who would come to his shop every day with a flask to have it filled with karak tea. .One day, her driver brought the flask and said the woman was in a hospital ready to give birth. But she needed her karak. .The next day, she herself showed up with her flask. .Ali’s restaurant is not an upmarket cafe, it’s a nondescript 65-year-old eatery on Doha’s Old Airport Road, so what inspires this loyalty? It’s the karak. .Karak is a sweet, milky tea made by boiling water, thick canned milk, tea leaves, sugar and cardamom (some places add saffron) together until it reaches just the right consistency, which varies according to the karak maker. .Everyone in Qatar knows what it is, and the country’s kaftheeriyas (cafes) serve thousands of cups of it daily, most costing just 1 riyal ($0.27). .Before the era of Instagram and social media influencers, finding a winning karak recipe, and having a good location, was the key to pulling in customers. .“The kaftheeriyas experimented with different blends of spices, milk and tea leaves to create flavours,” Ali said. .Walking into the shop is optional. You can honk your car’s horn and someone will be at your vehicle within seconds, ready to take your order. .How and when karak arrived in Qatar is still disputed, but the general consensus is that South Asian expats brought the milky tea with them as long ago as the 1950s. .Today, a lot of Qatar’s karak is made by people from the Moplah Muslim community of India’s North Malabar region, who were a land-owning, agrarian community. .“When agriculture went bust, youngsters from feudal families found the Gulf region as a haven where they could cash in doing any type of work away from home,” Rafeeq Thiruvalloor, a Malayalam writer from North Malabar, told Al Jazeera. .The same Malabaris brought samovar tea to Qatar. .Samovar tea, the more recent arrival which is gaining popularity now, and karak look the same but there are some major differences. .A karak, by default, is a strong tea, even the name sounds strong. Samovar tea is not strong by default, you have to request that, and it uses fresh milk whereas karak relies on thicker, canned milk. .With a standard karak, you don’t get many options when it comes to sugar levels. Many find karak oversweet and have to specify if they want a milder option. .In contrast, if you want your samovar tea sugary, you have to specify that in your order. Most samovar shops let you pick how you want your tea: strong, medium, light, waterless, well-beaten or unbeaten. .Before samovar, some karak tea shops served “fresh-milk tea” upon request – at double the price. There was also a “Sri Lankan tea”, simply a beaten version of karak. .Sajeer bin Abbas, a software engineer, said he stopped having tea at shops in Oman, where he worked for seven years, because the teabag-infused karak served there disgusted him. .“Now, samovar tea is one of the pleasures of working in Qatar,” he said. .No one remembers seeing a samovar tea shop in Qatar before 2014. Now, while the number is still shy of 100, you often see long lines forming outside. .By most accounts, Lordz Restaurant, tucked away in Al-Thumama’s Furjan Market 36, is Qatar’s first samovar tea shop. The shop is known as Sayyidinte Chayakada (Sayyid’s teashop) and its owner, 39-year-old Sayid Komban Chalil, said he launched the business in 2014. .He came to Qatar 20 years ago and worked at his father’s cafeteria in the southern city of Al-Wakra. Eight years ago, he brought a samovar, from Kozhikode’s Copper Bazaar in the Indian state of Kerala. .Until recently, Chalil says, his stencilled image with a “Sayyidinte Chayakada” logo was on the glass door but authorities asked him to remove it. The name exists on the shop’s website, on one of the inside walls and on the jerseys of three cricket clubs he sponsors. .Chalil, who comes to the shop now only in the evenings, said he was very active when he was setting up but owning a stable business helped him slow down. .On weekends, street cricketers flood his shop. He used to play for the Thumama Boys club and a shelf laden with trophies adorns one of the walls in the shop. .Until a recent repaint, Sayyidinte Chayakada was decorated with old Indian movie posters, giving it the look of old teashops in Malabar towns. .Samovar shops love their nostalgia. In Fereej Bin Mahmoud’s Chaya Kada, there are bicycles on the wall, old radios on display and a three-wheeled tuk-tuk rickshaw. New Plaza has a mural on the wall of a teashop in Kerala. In Asian Town’s Metro Restaurant, black and white photographs of a colonial Indian fort town adorn the wall. .Those suffering from homesickness can get a quick fix. .Chalil’s samovar is a barrel-shaped copper utensil that keeps 40 litres (10.5 gallons) of water boiling on a gas stove below a faucet. This is what is used to make the “decoction”, a potent sugarless black tea, and to keep milk simmering in an upper chamber. .Water is added through a hole on the top and milk heats up separately. The tea goes in the boiling water contained in a small fabric pouch, to keep the leaves from floating around in the finished tea. .If you want a cup of sugarless black tea, all it takes is about two tablespoons – 30ml (1 ounce) – of decoction added to 90-120ml (3-4 ounces) of boiling water. .Most samovar tea patrons, however, prefer milk tea. So the tea maker will add a ladle of simmering milk from a nearby stove and a spoon of sugar then he will “beat” the tea. .“The milk boiling on … top is a reserve. The tea-maker can’t always raise his hand to take it from there,” explained a tea-maker. .To beat the tea, the tea-maker pours it back and forth between a mug and a cup, raising and lowering his hand in a rapid, up-and-down movement to create froth. The consistency, foaminess and taste reach a new level with the beating, nearly impossible to replicate at home. .People watch the tea-beating pretty carefully. If the tea maker gets his hands really far apart, people call it “metre tea”, referring to the distance between the hands. .Beyond beating, the ratio of the ingredients, the heat dynamics of the stove,t the flavour of the decoction and milk, contribute to whether or not a tea maker is called a tea ustad (tea master). .Drinking tea at Lodz was Harshad Kuttipran, a samovar fan who likes exploring new places for tea and hopes to have a shop of his own. .His late father had teashops in India’s Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states. Growing up in Kerala, he remembered that teashops as institutions for socialising, where patrons could read newspapers and listen to the radio. “The news would lead to heated political debates,” Kuttipran said. .While people like Chalil are optimistic about the prospects of samovar tea in Qatar, many reckon karak tea will remain on top. .In Madinat Khalifa’s Kismath, a restaurant that serves samovar, tea-maker Salman has no time to talk. The one thing he said is that he makes 700 cups of tea during his shift. .But karak has a steady and established fan base, Muhammed Shibli, general manager at Tea Time, a chain with more than 50 branches across Qatar, said. .“People have more than 10 cups a day. We will remain serving karaks and only karaks for the time being,” Shibli said. .A partner in the Zanjabeel karak chain said his branches would serve only karak. However, Dosa Street, his south Indian cuisine venture in the Ain Khaled area of Doha, serves samovar tea. .Personally, he prefers karak because he finds the samovar tea makers’ habit of putting another layer of decoction over the foam sometimes leaves a sour taste. .In neighbourhoods like Matar Qadeem (Old Airport), where the population is younger and where gyms and barbershops are open round the clock, samovar tea shops provide a sense of community, or “vibes”, as the residents put it. .Many branches of House of Tea, another chain, have recently drifted towards samovar tea, said Kuttipran, the tea fan. .“Still, I don’t think Qataris and other Arabs will like the samovar, which is also generally less sugary than karaks.”",697
698,Published On 26 Sep 2022,Q&A: Ghana captain Ayew on team’s chances at Qatar World Cup,Ghana’s captain tells Al Jazeera about the team’s preparation and chances at the World Cup as well as the determination he wants from his players.,".Doha, Qatar – Ghana’s national football team captain Andre Ayew is confident that the Black Stars will be a tough team to beat at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar on November 20. .The Ghana squad has to be fit in order to put on the performance he’s hoping for, Ayew, who plays for Al Sadd football club in Qatar’s capital Doha, emphasised. .After missing the 2018 tournament, the Black Stars qualified for this year’s event, where they are in the same group as South Korea, Portugal and Uruguay, the team that knocked them out of the 2010 edition in South Africa. .Al Jazeera spoke to Ayew about the national side’s preparation, chances and expectations, as well as the benefit of his experience playing in Qatar. .Al Jazeera: The World Cup is less than two months away. How is the Black Stars’ preparation? .Ayew: Everything is in place for us to have a successful World Cup. We must have the best preparation possible but, most importantly, all of your players must be fit at that time. We played Brazil, we’ll play Nicaragua and Switzerland before the World Cup. They are all big games that will be tough even though they are friendlies. .These matches are beneficial because we put ourselves to the test and come back as a team to maintain bonding and unity. Normally, we have two to three weeks before the World Cup, but this time we only have about nine days. It’s not ideal but we have to adapt. .Al Jazeera: What are Ghana’s chances of reaching the knockout stage from the so-called “Group of Death”? .Ayew: We have a chance. Nobody sees us as favourites, which is expected. So we know we’re not going into any of the matches as favourites but we’re there to fight and make an impact. No doubt it will be a very difficult group for every team and all we have to do is be ready, focused, determined, full squad and have a bit of luck. .If we have our full squad, we can seriously disrupt a lot of teams. I am not concerned because I know what Ghana is capable of. .Al Jazeera: Will the game between Ghana and Uruguay be a revenge mission after the heartbreak of the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa? .Ayew: As team leader, I don’t believe we should view this game as revenge. Instead, we must be smart enough to recognise that it is a match we need points from. We can’t ignore history, but what Luis Suarez [Uruguay footballer] did is something I could have done in the same situation [used his hand to stop a goal-bound shot in 2010]. It hurt us all. But that’s part of football and it happened years ago. .We just want to win against Uruguay after everything that has been said in the media. As a player, if you go into a game with the intent of retaliation, you can make a lot of mistakes and be hyper. We just need to stay calm, follow the plan and try to win the game, or do whatever we can to advance to the next stage. .Al Jazeera: What are Ghanaians’ expectations of the Black Stars in the World Cup? Can they be met? .Ayew: Ghanaians expect tenacity, determination and a willingness to die for the jersey. When you come to the World Cup, you face super-strong sides and we’ve shown over time that we can compete with them and, in some cases, beat them. .But compete and show that you are willing to die for your country. If it results in a satisfactory outcome, thank God. If it does not, as long as the entire nation feels they have represented the country and Africa in the right way, that is the most important thing for me. .We are in the World Cup not only to showcase Ghanaian football, but Africa as well. Because there are only five African representatives,  all teams will receive African support whenever they play and this is how we should always be behind our own fellow brothers in order to make history in this tournament. .During the African Cup of Nations, we are all fighting for our countries, but during the World Cup, we are all fighting for the continent. Also, if we can present a good image of Africa on the field and compete against the top teams, everyone will be pleased. .Al Jazeera: Should Africa have more slots at a World Cup starting from 2026? .Ayew: If we have more teams, that will be fantastic. It’s about time. We have the most countries, but we are underrepresented, and the African qualifiers are always difficult and stressful. We have a lot of big teams, and the expectations are high, so it will be difficult for all of the big teams to qualify with only five slots. .If we can secure more berths, we will have a better chance of seeing an African team reach the semi-finals or even win the World Cup. .Al Jazeera: What are your thoughts on the new players who have switched allegiance to play for the Black Stars? Will they strengthen the team? .Ayew: The players are good, and qualifying for the World Cup makes you very attractive. Why not let the boys come? The door is open for any Ghanaian who wants to play for and help the country, but you must come with the same determination you put into your club, the same desire, and you cannot expect everything in your European club to be the same in the national team because there is a time for the team to adapt. .I fully support them and wish them the best of luck, especially when you come with a strong desire to succeed. When you have the right attitude and desire to sweat for the Ghana jersey, I am more than willing to welcome you, even though I am not the coach but a longtime member of the team. .The newcomers are talented, but we already have a strong team that qualified for the World Cup, so every position is competitive. Apart from senior players who may have an advantage, I believe no one is guaranteed a place in the squad just yet. Everyone must prove their quality on the field and everyone has a chance, giving the coach more options and solutions, formations, and I believe it is beneficial to have new players with the right mentality.",698
699,Published On 26 Sep 2022,Why Brazilian football fans are ditching the yellow jersey,"Once an icon of unity and luck, the association of the shirt with Brazil’s far right has led football fans to give up on it.",".Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – Higor Ramalho, an ardent football fan, plans to resume his regular trips to football stadiums as worries over the spread of the coronavirus ease, restrictions are lifted and the nation gets into the World Cup spirit. .However, the famous yellow jersey associated with the Brazilian national team has been hanging in his closet since June 2018. The last time he wore it was on his birthday. He does not know when, and if, he will ever wear it again. .“Wearing the yellow jersey was a moment of pride for me,” the 33-year-old told Al Jazeera. .“It was a symbol of victory. I used to wear it not only while watching matches but also on regular days. Now, I have stopped wearing it for political reasons. The current president, along with his supporters, turned the yellow jersey into a political campaign and a symbol of their political party. .“And as I don’t support their political ideas, I refuse to be mistaken as one of them.” .The yellow jersey, known as the “canarinho jersey”, has not always been the Brazil national team’s shirt. .It was designed in 1953, three years after the World Cup final heartbreak at the hands of Uruguay in the Maracana. At the time, the national team wore white. .The national football governing body, along with a newspaper, launched a competition to design a new uniform for the national side, the condition being the new kit should have the colours of the national flag as the current did not carry “the idea of Brazilian nationality”. .More than 300 entries were submitted. The winning submission was by Aldyr Garcia Schlee, a Brazilian who felt torn by the 1950 result given that he was born on the border with Uruguay. .Fast forward many years, including a record five football World Cup wins and two Copa America triumphs, the yellow jersey had become a symbol of optimism, luck and unity among football fans. .The number 10 worn by Pele during his mesmerising years on the pitch, Ronaldo’s number 9 when he became a World Cup winner and Romario’s number 11 during his dazzling World Cup 1994 run all became part of Brazil’s rich and successful history on the pitch. .But the shirt’s adoption in political campaigns, most recently by President Jair Bolsonaro and his right-wing supporters prior to his 2018 election win, forced a huge number of fans to give up on it. .Analysts say those same iconic moments of Brazilian football are being used off the pitch to promote ideas antithetical to the unity that made the national team, and the country, famous. .“Football is something iconic for Brazil, it is what brings everybody together most of the time,” Isabela Guedes, 25, told Al Jazeera. .“When they [right-wing supporters] take something so meaningful for the country and use it with political intentions, it is like they are stealing it from us. I don’t feel comfortable hanging a flag on my window during the World Cup because I will be mistaken for people with completely different political views. .“They have taken the flag and yellow jersey and turned them into political symbols.” .Co-opting the jersey did not start with Bolsanaro supporters. In 1970, the military dictatorship used the national flag and the team’s image, associating the essence of Brazil with the team, according to Carolina Fontenelle, a researcher at the Laboratory of Media and Sports Studies at UERJ. .General Medici, Brazil’s military leader at the time, also played a big role in the removal of the national team coach ahead of the 1970 Mexico World Cup. .With time, and these efforts, a strong connection was formed between Brazilians and their team’s jersey, she added. .“Since then, the yellow jersey has been perceived as a symbol. People look at that jersey and wear it with pride because they feel part of a group,” Fontenelle told Al Jazeera. .Before that, during the 2013 riots protesting a rise in the cost of living, corruption and police brutality, the jersey took on another aspect. .“People part of the riots were also wearing it. There was a high number of people on the streets protesting against many things, including the money spent on the World Cup 2014. In 2018, we had the far-right wearing the jersey,” Fontenelle said. .“So those who don’t agree with it start to feel ashamed. The jersey gives a feeling that you belong to a group and this feeling is lost when it is being used by a political group that doesn’t defend the minorities.” .“During the 2014 elections, the campaign of [centre-right candidate] Aecio Neves hijacked the colours of the Brazilian flag,” Fontenelle said. .Just over two years ago, a campaign, led by writer and filmmaker Joao Carlos Assumpcao, demanded the national football body abolish the famous yellow jersey and bring back the white and blue kit. .“We’re in a ghastly situation with a horrendous government that has stolen our flag,” Assumpcao had said at the time. .Several pro-democracy groups, including the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, tried to dissociate the colour with the far-right campaign. .In 2020, following campaigns by Bolsonaro supporters on the Supreme Court and Congress, it urged its readers to wear yellow as part of the dissociation campaign. .#DevolvamNossaBandeira (#GiveBackOurFlag) also got the backing of several political figures. .“Football is for everyone, I don’t like it [the jersey] being used by people who promote racism, sexism and discrimination,” Ademir Takara, the librarian and historian at the Museum of Football in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera. .“The shirt is the opposite of that. It represents unity and it’s not being used for that purpose. There’s an affectionate relationship between people and the shirt – the beautiful game attached to something it represented. .“From 2013, it has become a political thing more than ever before. It’s being used by people with different ideas who wanted something to unify them and the shirt was the easiest and strongest thing they saw.” .Earlier this month, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters flocked the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, among other cities, as part of a campaign push ahead of the October elections, just a month ahead of the Qatar World Cup. .Many of them wore the yellow jersey. .Former president Luiz Inacio Lula, tipped to win next month’s polls, lashed out at the demonstration on the anniversary of Brazil’s 200 years of independence. .“7 September should be a day of love and union for Brazil. Unfortunately, that’s not what is happening today. I have faith Brazil will recover its flag, its sovereignty and its democracy,” Lula tweeted. .With love for the jersey, football fan Marina Moreno told Al Jazeera how “frustrated” she was “to see the yellow jersey becoming a symbol of the current government”. .“Today, it is almost impossible to not associate it with the current president and his supporters. It’s automatic and it’s frustrating. I don’t support the current government and I don’t want to be mistaken for one of his supporters so I decided to don’t to wear it any more.”",699
700,Published On 16 Sep 2022,Chile loses FIFA appeal in World Cup case with Ecuador,FIFA dismissed Chile’s argument that Ecuador player Castillo was Colombian and ineligible to play at the World Cup.,".Chile has lost its appeal to the world governing body challenging Ecuador’s place at the upcoming football World Cup in Qatar. .FIFA on Friday dismissed Chile’s argument that Ecuadorian player Byron Castillo was actually Colombian and ineligible to play in World Cup qualifying games. Castillo played in eight qualifiers for Ecuador. .The organisation said its appeal judges “deemed that on the basis of the documents presented, the player was to be considered as holding permanent Ecuadorian nationality in accordance” with football’s legal statutes. .The verdict, which upholds a FIFA disciplinary ruling from June, has kept Chile out of the tournament and Ecuador on track to face Qatar in the opening game of the World Cup in Doha on November 20. .However, Chile’s legal challenge can continue. .The Chilean football federation can now appeal against FIFA’s verdict to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. CAS, sport’s highest court, can organise an urgent hearing and give a ruling in the nine weeks left until the World Cup begins. .Chile claimed to have evidence proving Castillo is Colombian and should never have played for Ecuador. .Chile prepared its case after the World Cup draw was made on April 1, and after FIFA and Qatari organisers sold thousands of tickets and accommodation rooms to Ecuador fans. . .Had Ecuador forfeited all eight games Castillo played, Chile would have risen to the fourth automatic qualification place in the South American qualifying group. Ecuador would have dropped out of contention. .FIFA’s legal statutes include a section on national team eligibility when a state government has granted citizenship to players. .“Any person holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country is eligible to play for the representative teams of the association of that country,” according to the statutes. .The FIFA appeals committee rarely overturns a ruling by the football body’s disciplinary committee. Chile has filed complaints against an opponent’s player in back-to-back World Cup qualifying programmes.",700

It presented its appeal on Thursday. .FIFA previously said it asked Ecuador player Byron Castillo, who Chilean officials claim is actually Colombian and should not have played in World Cup qualifying games, to be available to testify. The appeal hearing was being conducted remotely from Zurich with only the three judges present. .A verdict is expected by early next week – possibly as soon as Friday – though it is unlikely to resolve the case. .Either the Chilean or Ecuadorian football federation can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if they lose. CAS would then manage an urgent case in Lausanne, Switzerland. .The FIFA appeals committee rarely overturns a ruling by the football body’s disciplinary committee, which sided with Ecuador in a decision on June 10. .Castillo played in eight World Cup qualifiers and helped Ecuador advance to the tournament by placing fourth in the 10-team South American group. .Chile claims to have documents proving Castillo was never eligible to play for Ecuador and so should forfeit all eight games. That would lift Chile to fourth place and drop Ecuador out of contention. .The case is proceeding while FIFA and Qatari organisers are selling thousands of tickets and accommodation rooms to Ecuador fans. .Chile prepared its legal arguments after the World Cup draw was made on April 1, when Ecuador was put into Group A with Qatar, the Netherlands and Senegal. .The FIFA judge overseeing the case is Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel in the second administration of former US President Barack Obama.",701

703,Published On 14 Sep 2022,How the Qatar World Cup will highlight Israel’s blockade of Gaza,"Palestinian footballers, Gaza residents slam Israel’s 15-year-long blockade that has limited freedom of movement.",".Gaza City – Palestinian footballer Fadi Jaber was overjoyed when Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup. .A 32-year-old professional footballer at a local club in the besieged Gaza Strip, Jaber started his sports career at an early age before going on to become a member of the Palestinian national team. .“It was a wonderful moment, the first time an Arab country will host the World Cup,” Fadi told Al Jazeera. .“At that time, my fellow footballers and I were thrilled. We were hoping we’d be there and attend the World Cup or even be able to take part in it.” .But Jaber and his colleagues knew it would be difficult, not because of the football but the restrictions Israel has placed on travelling. .Israel’s 15-year-old blockade which restricts the right to travel freely for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip has made the thought of going anywhere unattainable. .Imposed in 2007, Israel’s blockade has been a huge obstacle for more than two million Gazans facing strict restrictions on their movement, with human rights organisations describing the impoverished enclave as the largest open-air prison in the world. .“People in Gaza have a hard time travelling, whether through the Rafah crossing [run by Egypt] or the Erez crossing [run by Israel].” Fadi added. Erez is the Israeli name for the crossing otherwise known as Beit Hanoon to Palestinians. .“Traveling to attend the World Cup is a luxury here. People in Gaza consider travelling as something for an urgent need and it’s not as normal as other countries.” .The Qatar World Cup will kick off on November 20. As the first football World Cup to be hosted in the Middle East, it has become an eagerly awaited event for most Arabs in the region, including those in Gaza. .Israel’s restrictions on travel movement from Gaza also cast a shadow over the world of sports, including footballers who face difficulties in moving between the occupied West Bank and Gaza while also needing to travel out of Gaza to take part in football tournaments. .Due to the blockade, Jaber and his national team colleagues have been unable to participate in local, regional and continental championships. “As a footballer in the Palestinian national team, I cannot go to the West Bank to attend the local and Arab tournaments,” Jaber said. .“My fellow players and I always bemoan at the missed opportunities that could have changed our lives as footballers. .“The Palestinian footballers from Gaza are oppressed. We are part of the Palestinian people, and we are subjected to the restrictions that Israel imposes against us.” .Although FIFA, football’s world governing body, has always stressed that a safe environment must be provided for its international fans and players to move and travel, Palestinians say this was not the case for their national team. .Jaber believes FIFA has not made enough effort to support the Palestinian footballers from Gaza to facilitate their careers and travel to Qatar for the World Cup. .“Israel does not comply with any human rights or international organisations, including FIFA,” he said. .Alaa Attia, a 32-year-old footballer, told Al Jazeera that there is a “global disregard” for the situation of Palestinian football players and fans from the Gaza Strip. .“The Israeli footballers can easily travel all over the world. They have absolute freedom of travel while the Palestinian players are completely deprived.” .Last June, Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Sports Minister Chili Tropper announced that Israelis will be able to attend the World Cup matches in Qatar. .The ministers said the agreement came after months of talks with FIFA, saying it would open “a new door” to a country with which Israel does not currently have formal diplomatic relations. .“It is sad that we are denied the easy travel to an Arab country, while those who’re occupying our lands are allowed that chance freely,” Attia said. .“As footballers, we don’t mix politics with sports, but the matter is different for the Palestinian players. .“What is our fault that we cannot attend the World Cup in Qatar? We hope this matter will be reviewed and facilitated for the people in Gaza of their right of travel movement.” .Attia agreed with Jaber that FIFA has exerted pressure on Israel more than once but to no avail. He added that the governing body did not make enough effort to pressure Israel to allow Palestinians to travel freely. .“I do not understand why FIFA disregards the right of Palestinian players from Gaza to travel and participate in international tournaments. Why does it ignore our right to facilitate travel to Qatar? .“This is totally unfair and contrary to the principles that FIFA claims to have. It is a difficult feeling to see the whole world heading to the World Cup in Qatar, and because of the restrictions imposed on us in Gaza, we find ourselves deprived of this opportunity.” .As an enviable exception, Ahmed Owais, 60, a retired school principal, plans to travel to Qatar for the World Cup. .“I decided I will go for Qatar World Cup the moment it won the bid in 2010,” Owais told Al Jazeera. .“I had never thought before of attending the World Cup in other countries and I was more encouraged that I would be retired and without work commitments.” .Owais says he wants to travel to Qatar because it is an Arab country that has a strong international, global and sports presence, and supports the Palestinian cause. .“It is true that attending the World Cup is a luxury, but the difference in the Gaza Strip is that even those who have the financial possibility to leave, and travel cannot do so because of the many restrictions imposed on the crossings. .“Being close to the players you love and between the crowds is exciting. For the first time, I will be watching things that the camera doesn’t show. It’s totally different. .“I hope that the Gaza Strip will have an opportunity for professional athletes just like the West Bank, and football teams can move easily between the two places.” .Owais recounted the difficulties facing the national teams moving between the occupied West Bank and Gaza. .“If the Rafah team, for example, goes to West Bank, some of them are denied permits, and the same if the Hebron team comes to Gaza, some of them are denied permits too.” .In the past, FIFA has said it would “continue to facilitate the movement of players, officials and football equipment in, out of, and within Palestine”. .However, following a complaint by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: “These territories are a concern for the international public law authorities and FIFA has to remain neutral”. .The PFA complained that the Israeli blockade hampers its activities, including restricting players’ movements and also banning some international travel. .According to the Reuters news agency, Israel has cited security concerns for its actions and the Israeli FA says it is not responsible for the actions of its government. .But Ramy Abdu, the Chairman of the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, told Al Jazeera that FIFA “has always exerted great pressure on several governments to urge them to abide by human rights standards”. .“FIFA exerted pressure on Iran in order to allow women to attend football matches and recently the suspension of Russian clubs,” he said. .Yet he says FIFA has turned “a blind eye” to Israeli violations, which are not limited to the political and humanitarian sector but to the sports sector as well. .“Israel has repeatedly obstructed the holding of the Palestine final matches by preventing the movement of Palestinian footballers between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. .“Now, residents of the Gaza Strip will be unable to travel through the Israeli-controlled Erez crossing to attend the World Cup matches in Qatar, cementing the fact that the 15-year-old Israeli blockade suffocates all aspects of Palestinians’ daily lives in the Strip.”",703
704,Published On 12 Sep 2022,The impact of India’s growing sports tourism market on football,Their team has never played at a football World Cup but thousands are expected to experience Qatar 2022.,".Of the 1.8 million Qatar World Cup 2022 tickets sold across the first two phases, more than 23,500 were bought by fans in India. .After the first phase of ticketing, India was ranked seventh in ticket sales. .At Russia 2018, almost 18,000 fans from India were in attendance. Across all non-competing countries, India had the third highest number of fans in Russia, behind only the United States and China. .So what drives the fans of a country, whose women’s side is ranked 58th and the men’s team is at 104th and has never played in a World Cup, to the world’s biggest sporting event in such big numbers? .It’s a strange dichotomy best illustrated by the fact that the national men’s team captain Sunil Chhetri had to post a video through the Indian Football Team Twitter handle urging fans to attend the team’s Asian Cup qualifiers in Kolkata in June this year. .There’s something pitiful about the video, that one of the country’s greatest sportspersons, a man who sits third on the list of active international goal scorers, has to plead to fans to come and watch his team in the flesh. .While the video had the desired effect and led to sellout crowds, it is reflective of the state of Indian football. .In May this year, it was reported that the funding of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) had been slashed by 85 percent. Last month, FIFA temporarily banned India over third-party interference. .Poor performance of the men’s team, a lack of structure in the women’s game and inadequate development at the grassroots level were cited as reasons for the budget cut. .In January this year, a YouGov survey conducted on behalf of the Indian Super League club FC Goa showed that there are 160 million football fans in India. The passion for the sport clearly exists, it’s just a matter of where it’s being channelled. .“The problem is how fans are segregated in India, in the sense of what type of identity they possess when it comes to football,” said Debanjan Banerjee, a football culture and behaviour researcher based in Bangalore. .“There’s a reason it is misportrayed to the world that India doesn’t have football fans because the number of fans that support Indian football is very less compared to the ratio that supports European football.” .As one of the core members of the Blue Pilgrims – a supporters’ group that follows the Indian men’s and women’s football teams at every match, Banerjee has a clear understanding of the attitudes and behaviours towards the national teams. .At a time when football has become what Banerjee says is a “global identity for the youth”, he believes India’s lack of success on the international stage has made it difficult for fans to link themselves to the team. .“The reason to support a football club or why people travel for football is to express themselves in a way which they feel is larger than themselves and also connects them to something which is more successful and is positive,” he said. .That leads to the fact that fans tend to borrow identities. .Banerjee spent the 2018 World Cup in the southern Indian state of Kerala, shooting a documentary on the state’s connection to football. .In it, he vividly captured the frenzy the tournament evoked in people and the devout fandom for Brazil and Argentina. The fan groups of these countries operated like political parties: separate “offices” where supporters congregate and watch matches together. .An organising committee is shown erecting cutouts of players along the streets along with large murals up to 50 feet (15 metres) high. .The rivalries run deep and these fan groups constantly try to outshine each other. In one of the documentary scenes, a fight breaks out between the groups in the middle of the night and has to be broken up by the church parish. .Rakesh Pai is one such fanatical Argentina fan from Kerala. Pai, who works at an investment firm in Bangalore, became smitten by the Albiceleste as most were, by Diego Maradona. .His first brush with the World Cup came as a seven year old in 1990, where his lasting memory was Maradona crying in the final. .Pai did not know who he was but his pain resonated with him. A love affair grew out of this heartbreak. .His passion only grew as the years passed and, in 2010, he flew to South Africa with his brother to watch Argentina in the flesh for the first time. .While the tournament ended poorly for Argentina, the experience had Pai hooked. In 2014, Pai went to Brazil with his wife and brother. He and his brother also learned Spanish to mingle with other Argentine fans. These friendships were rekindled at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. .Qatar 2022 will be Pai’s fourth World Cup and he spoke of receiving numerous calls from friends and acquaintances, asking questions about ticketing and pricing. .He mentioned how some of these people are not even ardent football supporters. Aside from Qatar’s geographical proximity to India, Pai believes the perceived difficulty in obtaining a visa puts people off travelling to other far-flung countries. .“Visa has never been a problem at any of these World Cups. There are some communication issues due to which I faced problems in South Africa and in Brazil, but it was never a problem to get a visa,” he said. “But, we [Pai and his brother] didn’t know that at the time. Only when we got the visa, we realised ‘Oh, the process is so simple’.” .The comfort factor of the Middle East can’t be overlooked. .Making up about a quarter of the population, there are more than 750,000 Indians in Qatar. .The chances of knowing a friend or relative who lives in Qatar are high and aside from providing an accommodation option, they can help secure match tickets. Pai sourced tickets all the way to the semi-finals through a friend who lives in Qatar. .There is a separate category just for Qatar residents with tickets starting at 40 riyals ($11 or 876 Indian rupees) and they are allowed to have non-residents as guests. .The close proximity of the stadiums is also a benefit for travelling fans. But this is one of the reasons why longtime football fan and co-founder of the fabled Bengaluru FC supporters group West Block Blues, Rakesh Haridas is not too keen on attending the 2022 World Cup. .“Qatar 2022 doesn’t excite me. You go to a World Cup to experience the country as such. if you look at Russia, one match was in Sochi, one in Moscow … that’s the whole setup of the World Cup and something we know of,” he said. .However, Haridas understands that it is the players, not places, pulling fans to Qatar. .“That sunset era of some of the biggest stars of football is a big addition. One, these are people who you grew up watching in the last 12 to 15 years. And, it’s much easier to watch Messi play in Qatar than in Paris,” he said. .The bucket list-esque nature of this World Cup is what makes it such an attractive proposition for corporates. .Raj Khandwala, CEO of Mumbai-based sports management and travel company Cutting Edge, spoke of the monotony that has crept into traditional corporate social events like sightseeing and clubbing. .“Now, they [corporates] want to create experiences for their clients, customers or staff. So, they want to show them an F1 race or a Wimbledon game or a football World Cup. Something which is an experience for them,” said Khandwala. .Cutting Edge is the joint-exclusive sales agent of match hospitality in India for this year’s World Cup and Khandwala estimated that the hospitality ticket sales in India could end up at anywhere between $20-$25m. .Corporates account for nearly 75 percent of Cutting Edge’s sales for the World Cup. The packages range from the “pinnacle of luxury” to the “true fan experience” as per their brochure. The packages include private dining experiences, six-course meals with live chef counters, champagne selections, extended service, prime match views and preferential parking, among other things. .The cheapest match ticket offered by Cutting Edge is $950 and the cost for the hotel stay is between $500 to $800 for a two-night package. The company has currently done the ticketing for more than 4,000 Indian fans and Khandwala expects that number to rise to 5,500 by the time the tournament commences. .Sports tourism has evolved into a lucrative market with a lot of new entrants in recent years. .Prominent Indian fantasy company Dream11 launched DreamSetGo in 2019, a company that aims to combine sports and premium travel. .Bharat Army, the famed Indian cricket supporters group that follows the team in large numbers across the globe, launched its own sports tourism arm called Bharat Army Travel & Tours in 2015. .Travel companies like Thomas Cook and Cox & Kings, too, have redoubled their efforts in this space. .“It’s growing. The landscape is nuts. People are going to go for sports, everyone wants to do sports, everyone wants to experience things and sports tourism will be the biggest thing coming to India,” said Khandwala. .The numbers match his enthusiasm. A study conducted by Thrillophilia showed that adventure and experiential tourism is expected to grow at a compared annual growth rate of 17.4 percent from 2017 to 2023. .There is also a mindset shift driving this growth. Millennials, who prioritise experiences and are willing to spend money on them, are the largest demographic group in the country. A study by Deloitte in 2019 showed that the ambition of 57 percent of millennials and an equal number of Gen Z in the country was to travel and see the world. .As before, India may not be at the World Cup but Indians will be making their presence felt in the stands once again.",704

Where: Lusail Stadium, Qatar
Time: 18:00 GMT .Top football clubs from Saudi Arabia and Egypt will face off in the Lusail Super Cup at the Lusail Stadium on Friday, with the match between  Al Hilal SFC and Zamalek FC  serving as a test run for the FIFA World Cup 2022 that kicks off in Qatar on November 20. .The game between the Saudi Pro League champions and Egyptian Premier League winners will be the first match to be held at the stadium, which will host the World Cup 2022 final, featuring two foreign teams. .Egyptian music legend Amr Diab will also perform at the venue which has a capacity of 80,000 and is the last of the eight World Cup venues to host matches. .Qatar 2022 Chief Executive Officer Nasser Al Khater said last week there was “no better way to test the full capacity of Lusail Stadium than by hosting two of the region’s biggest clubs”. .“Both Al Hilal and Al Zamalek enjoy massive support and boast a stellar record of accolades at both domestic and continental levels their pedigree will be a perfect match for a venue as magnificent as Lusail Stadium,” he was quoted as saying by Qatar News Agency. . .Last month, a Qatar Star League fixture was the first competitive game to be held in the venue which was attended by 20,000 people. .Lusail Stadium is the football stadium in the country and will be officially inaugurated during the tournament itself. .The venue, located 15km (nine miles) from the capital Doha’s city centre, will host a total of 10 matches during the World Cup where Qatar is hoping to attract more than one million visitors. .Termed the most “compact World Cup” in history, the decision to award the tournament to the Gulf nation has been previously criticised due to its human rights violations. .Concerns have also been raised about accommodation for international visitors and fans, especially those without tickets and wanting to experience the World Cup and the country’s culture in various areas away from the stadiums, fan zones and public areas. .The game between Al Hilal and Zamalek will be their second encounter in nearly four years. .The Riyadh-based Al Hilal lifted its record third consecutive SPL title this year while Zamalek won the Egyptian league for a second successive season. .In their last match in October 2018 Zamalek defeated Al Hilal 2-1 to claim the Saudi-Egyptian Super Cup in Riyadh. .Al Hilal go into the game having won their last five matches while the Giza-based Zamalek have won only two. .The winner will be awarded $1.5m while the losing team will receive $1m. .The game will also serve as a stress test for the Qatar organisers with less than 75 days to go to the World Cup. .The public transportation company Mowasalat will run a full stadium express service with a fleet of more than 900 buses to transfer spectators to and from the stadium. .The company added in a press release that a “Park and Ride” facility will also be available on the day and a special bus service has been deployed for fans travelling from neighbouring countries. .There will also be a dedicated fleet of 350 taxis in the country to cater for fans attending the match, the company added. .Crowd management inside and outside the stadium will also be put to the test, including the use of the Doha Metro which will extend its service until 3am (oo:oo GMT) for the event.",706
707,Published On 8 Sep 2022,Qatar residents will be able to rent out homes for the World Cup,Organisers make the announcement as concerns over lack of accommodation for travelling fans continue to grow less than 80 days before the tournament.,".Qatar residents will be able to put their houses and rooms up for rent to facilitate World Cup fans in an attempt to ease accommodation concerns for the football tournament, which kicks off on November 20. .Until now, World Cup ticket holders were only able to book accommodation via the official Qatar Accommodations Agency (QAA), with options including, but not limited to, hotels, fan villages, official desert camps, two cruise ships, villas and apartments. .Speaking on Thursday at Lusail Stadium, the venue for the World Cup final on December 18, Director General of the Special Committee for the World Cup Yasir al Jamal said ticket holders will be eligible to apply their Fan IDs or Hayya Card using a booking that is from a third-party source and not necessarily needing a reservation from the QAA or providing details about friends and families who live in the country. .“We have done this to allow more people to apply for Hayya cards,” Jamal said. “In addition to this, we are also committed to ensure appropriate and affordable prices for fans starting at $80 that can change depending on the demand we see from fans.” .Qatar is hoping to attract more than one million visitors during the World Cup. .Given the expected influx of fans and tourists, there are concerns that Qatar may not be able to offer enough accommodation to visitors, especially those without tickets and wanting to experience the World Cup and the country’s culture in various areas away from the stadiums, including public areas and fan zones. .Residents have also complained of being evicted from their residences, with landlords saying that move was to make way for the visiting fans during the tournament. .An official from the Supreme Committee (SC), the host organisers, confirmed to Al Jazeera earlier this year that the organisers had block-booked 80 percent of the hotels and accommodation options across the country that will be available to ticket holders. .According to Omar al-Jaber, executive director of accommodation at the SC, “the two cruise ships will have more than 4,000 rooms. There will be fan villages at four different locations. Accommodation options will also be available through vacation homes and visitors have the option of staying with friends and family”. .Last month, the SC announced “Caravans Village” will also be prepared to provide additional accommodation options. .Earlier this year, Al Jazeera reported that visitors arriving in Qatar without match tickets may not be able to secure a place to stay. .In an email sent to Al Jazeera, the organisers had said that “with up to 130,000 rooms for the one million-plus fans expected over the course of the tournament, there are no concerns over a shortfall of accommodation”. .On Thursday, Qatar 2022 CEO Nasser al-Khater said around 2.5 million tickets out of the three million allocated for the World Cup had already been sold. .In addition to Qatar, the United States, Argentina, Mexico and Saudi Arabia were among the top countries where tickets to the tournament had been bought, he said.",707
708,Published On 7 Sep 2022,Creating a legacy of sport for health,The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar is a great opportunity to promote healthy lifestyles through sport.,".With Qatar soon to take the centre stage of world sports, the World Health Organization and the Qatar Ministry of Public Health are driving efforts to help make this year’s celebration of football, the “world’s game”, a beacon for health and safety, and a launchpad for sharing lessons with major sporting events in the future. .Set to be held in Doha from November 20 to December 18, the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar is a unique platform for us to promote health across the world and to communicate that sport and health go together. They are intertwined and, together, they play out in a celebration of joy, wellbeing, and solidarity for billions of people around the world. .Our partnership in Sport For Health has two main objectives: first, to work with key partners to help make the 2022 FIFA World Cup – the first to be held in the Middle East – healthy and safe; and second, to capture and share lessons learned with our partners and organisers of other large sporting events. .The partnership, which is supported by FIFA and Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy as part of a drive to promote health globally through football, began last October. Since then, we have worked in close collaboration to promote physical health and wellbeing in several ways. These include promoting health and nutritional awareness during the Holy Month of Ramadan, engaging in the third edition of the “Walk the Talk: Health For All Challenge” initiative in Geneva, and raising awareness of the harms caused by smoking on World No Tobacco Day. .By focusing on physical activity, healthy diets and nutrition, tobacco control, mental health, and health security, we are working to provide guidance on how to help improve the physical and mental health of all people globally through sports. .Our goals are ambitious, and based on three key pillars: First, promoting health through strategic collaboration with governments and sporting organisations, reaching billions of people through football and other sports; second, making major sporting events safe for fans, players and staff; and third, sharing information with the public to help them make healthy lifestyle choices. .The partnership is leveraging this year’s FIFA World Cup to promote the health benefits of physical activity for all through sport by developing new tools to reach people of all ages, particularly youth. As partners, we have been busy developing science-based guidance through technical engagement to communicate the importance of physical activity. .One of the key findings is that good mental health can often be linked to regular physical activity, which includes sports or, simply walking and participating in physical activities with others. This can also help to promote a sense of inclusion and community. .Whether you are involved with high-intensity workouts or even just gardening, every effort counts towards a healthy body and mind. To further promote healthy lives, we are underscoring the importance of nutrition by demonstrating the benefits of offering healthy food choices at large sporting events. .In the same vein, at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, smoke-free stadiums and bans on tobacco marketing will help to protect people from this deadly product. The benefits of these measures will help promote and protect the health of sports followers at future large sporting events. .Lastly, keeping sporting events safe through a commitment to health security is a fundamental pillar of the project. .From ensuring the implementation of mass gathering protocols outside and inside stadiums, to adhering to control measures to protect people from infectious disease outbreaks, we are committed to working with partners to ensure all necessary steps are taken to make sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, safe and secure. .As we all know, teamwork is essential for success in sports. The same is true for protecting and promoting health. We are committed to continually to strive together, for this year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar, and beyond to leverage the global power of sport to help people lead the healthiest lives possible. .The views expressed in this article are the authors’ own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",708

I feel pressure to earn everyone’s trust and make that happen,” the 36-year-old told reporters in Tokyo. .She also understands the benefits of her time in the spotlight, saying she feels her very presence in a traditionally male-dominated event shows new possibilities are opening up for women. .“There are barely any female referees in the Middle East, and it would be wonderful to see even just one more female referee after the World Cup,” she said. .Yamashita was named in May alongside France’s Stephanie Frappart and Rwanda’s Salima Mukansanga as officials for Qatar later this year – the first women to referee at a men’s World Cup. .According to FIFA, the women will be joined by Neuza Back from Brazil, Karen Diaz Medina from Mexico, and Kathryn Nesbitt from the United States, all named assistant referees among 69 others for the tournament. .“The goal is to get to the point where it’s not a big deal that a woman is refereeing a men’s match, but at this stage I’m happy this is making a splash,” Yamashita said. .Qatar will not be the first place that Yamashita will break new ground in the sport. .On top of officiating at the 2019 Women’s World Cup and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, she became the first woman to referee matches in the J-League and Asian Champions League. .However, inclusion for Qatar does not guarantee she or the two other women on the referee list will be blowing the whistle during matches. They could be designated as “fourth officials” who assist from the sidelines. .But whether she makes it on the pitch or not, Yamashita’s preparation for the global sporting showpiece will not change. .“I’m really conscious of the speed, I make split-second decisions. I have to continue training that muscle as the World Cup draws closer and be prepared to adjust to speedy developments,” she said, adding she has been practising by watching videos of previous matches. .“I have been inspired by each and every referee, and they all have qualities I’d like to have.” .Describing herself as one percent nervous and 99 percent excited, she demurred when asked if there were any particular players whose matches she hoped to officiate. .“That’s a secret,” she said with a laugh.",709

It will also include training for the protection of very important people (VIPs) and to counter threats posed by improvised explosive devices.” .South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported in June that Seoul will send five police officers specialising in counterterrorism to Qatar and will “pass on ‘know-how’ in the field of law enforcement, such as security, close combat skills, arrest techniques, and maintaining public order, to the Qatari military police until October”.",710

714,Published On 4 Aug 2022,How specialist commentary will help blind fans at Qatar World Cup,Training programme for commentators accommodating to blind or partially sighted fans inside the stadium.,".Doha, Qatar – Ikraimi Ahmad was born blind, but the 32-year-old Egyptian knows how to describe a football match. .In the Arab Cup football tournament held in the Qatari capital, Doha, last December, Ahmad knew what the team jerseys were like, which players had tattoos, their haircuts and which player kicked the ball only with the left foot. .The experience was made possible thanks to the commentators who were trained in Doha to provide ultra-detailed audio descriptive commentary (ADC) in Arabic for those needing it inside the stadium. .The idea, according to the trainers, is not just to describe the on-field action for the blind and partially sighted but to deliver a full experience, narrating the atmosphere that accompanies the matches. .“You can really see what is going on,” Ahmad, a Qatar resident, told Al Jazeera. “What is different here is the ability to experience the event, to go to the stadium, to be part of the crowd cheering and singing.” .Users need to download an app, key in a match-specific code and listen to the commentary sitting anywhere inside the stadium. .During Brazil 2014 and Russia 2018 – and some European tournaments – ADC services were offered in English only, with the 2021 Arab Cup being the first major tournament to have this service in Arabic, a key requirement given Qatar 2022 will be the first football World Cup to be hosted in the Middle East. .The training programmes are being held at Qatar’s Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) in partnership with the Center for Access to Football in Europe (CAFE). .Trainees have to pass three exams before being selected and will then undergo refresher classes as the World Cup approaches. .So far, it has trained 64 Arabic-speaking commentators, with 21 of them commentating at the World Cup that kicks off in November. .“This is a very revolutionary thing that we are doing,” Alan March, a leading ADC figure and conducting the training programme in Doha, told Al Jazeera. .He added that audio commentary was “all about details”, describing things that a traditional audience would never consider. .“Forget about naming footballers as they touch the ball. Instead, which side of the pitch does the ball come from? How far away from the goalkeeper is the striker kicking the ball and was it inside or outside the penalty box,” he added. .The Arabic language does pose some challenges, March said, adding that with its more descriptive and rich vocabulary and the reversed sentence structure compared with English it was harder to deliver short and quick sentences as a match moves fast. .Mohammed Ghazal had double motivation for joining the training programme. .A finance manager and football enthusiast, Ghazal had tried in the past to make a career in football commentary but never had the chance to pursue it. .His extra motivation was due to the challenges his eight-year-old autistic son faces in accessing sport events. .“In the community, I would hardly find activities that suit my son’s needs. So when I heard of such an opportunity, I was happy to be part of it,” Ghazal told Al Jazeera. .“The feeling that my son was listening to me was very exciting,” he said, referring to when he commentated during the Arab Cup. .ADC is a small but important step in making football accessible for disabled people around the world. .“We found a lot of progress over the last 12 years,” said Michael Rice, a CAFE representative. “The picture back then was very different. But despite progress, there is still a very long way to go.” .The first ADC training, and service, was offered during the Euro 2012 tournament co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. .The service was provided by connecting a headset to a device, which proved to be challenging to access at the stadium. CAFE changed the format and made sure the ADC was available on FM frequencies. .But, Rice said, the challenges remain, especially considering the wide array of difficulties that disabled people encounter from landing in a country to watch a match, finding accommodation and using public transport in a new city. .“We are keen to use these tournaments not as an endpoint, but [as] a bigger domestic journey within each country. We hope the message of accessibility will drip out and leave a legacy across the country,” Rice said.",714

The new hotels will also support Qatar’s growing tourism industry post-2022,” Nasser al-Khater, Qatar 2022 CEO, said. .More than one million fans are expected to visit Qatar for the tournament. .Argentina: Qatar University

717,Published On 1 Jul 2022,World Cup in Qatar to use semi-automated offside system,The new system uses a limb-tracking camera system to track player movements and a sensor in the ball.,".FIFA has confirmed that a semi-automated offside system will be used at this year’s football World Cup in Qatar. .The new technology utilises a limb-tracking camera system to track player movements and a sensor in the ball. .It then quickly shows 3D images on stadium screens at the tournament to help fans understand the referee’s call. .It is the third World Cup in a dispute that will see FIFA introduce new technology to help referees. .The optical tracking system was trialled at the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi earlier this year and had also been tested at the Arab Cup in Qatar last December. .“Semi-automated offside technology is an evolution of VAR systems that have been implemented across the world,” the global body’s President Gianni Infantino said in a statement on Friday. VAR is an acronym for Video Assistant Referee. .“This technology is the culmination of three years of dedicated research and testing to provide the very best for the teams, players and fans who will be heading to Qatar later this year, and FIFA is proud of this work, as we look forward to the world seeing the benefits of semi-automated offside technology at the World Cup 2022,” he added. .Goal-line technology was ready for the 2014 tournament in Brazil after a notorious refereeing error in 2010. In 2018, a video review to help referees judge game-changing incidents was rolled out in Russia. .The new offside system promises faster and more accurate decisions than are currently made with the VAR system, even though the 2018 World Cup avoided significant mistakes on offside calls. .Controversy has since flared in European leagues, especially where VAR officials draw on-screen lines over players for marginal calls. They have been mocked as “armpit offsides” because of the tiny margins. .“Although these tools are quite accurate, this accuracy may be improved,” said Pierluigi Collina, who leads FIFA’s refereeing programme and worked the 2002 World Cup final in the pre-technology era. .Each stadium in Qatar will have 12 cameras beneath the roof synchronised to track 29 data points on each player’s body 50 times per second. Data is processed with artificial intelligence to create a 3D offside line that is alerted to the team of VAR officials. .A sensor in the match ball tracks its acceleration and gives a more precise “kick point” – when the decisive pass is played – to align with the offside line data, FIFA innovation director Johannes Holzmüller said in an online briefing. .Ensuring football’s biggest event is a showcase for technological progress – and avoids obvious errors that live on in World Cup lore – has been a longtime FIFA goal. .The shot by England’s Frank Lampard that crossed the Germany goal-line in 2010 but was not given as a goal almost immediately ended then-President Sepp Blatter’s opposition to giving referees technological aids. .Later that same day in South Africa, a clearly incorrect offside call let Carlos Tevez score Argentina’s first goal in a 3-1 win over Mexico in the round of 16. .In 2014, Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to advance from the group in its first World Cup after Edin Dzeko’s early goal against Nigeria was wrongly judged offside. Nigeria went on to win 1-0. .FIFA’s push to get the new offside technology ready for the World Cup was slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. .Within seconds of a possible offside, a specialist member of the VAR team can manually check the data-created line for attackers and defenders and the kick point of the pass, Holzmüller said. .It falls to the senior VAR official to alert the match referee of the right decision by their audio link. That should take from 20 to 25 seconds compared with an average of 70 seconds currently for a complex offside call. .“Sometimes the length of checks of reviews is definitely too long,” Collina said, acknowledging delays disrupt the flow of games. “For [VAR officials] time flies, but for the rest – for coaches, for players, for spectators – it’s completely different.” .The same 3D animations of offside calls that VARs will use should then be available to broadcasters and shown on stadium screens, likely during the next stop in play. .Collina was enthusiastic about the technology but less so about the often-used description of “robot referees.” .“I understand that sometimes this is very good for headlines but this is not the case,” said the Italian official, defending the key human element of decision-making in football. .Collina also agreed that improved technology will not end the game’s love of controversy and debating key incidents. .“There will be still room for discussion,” he said.",717
718,Published On 30 Jun 2022,The cost of Nigeria’s failure to qualify for Qatar World Cup 2022,"Footballers, officials, fans and business owners in Qatar are counting their losses after the national team failed to qualify for the World Cup.",".Doha, Qatar – Nigerian football fans and business owners in Qatar are still reeling from their team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup 2022, which will be held in the Middle Eastern country from November 21 to December 18. .Nigeria’s failure to beat Ghana in March prevented them from qualifying for Qatar 2022, a result that shocked not only the nation but also dealt a huge blow to the approximate 12,000 Nigerians in Qatar who were looking forward to watching the team in action and also benefitting from its presence at the tournament. .Ekene Romeo, a businessman who has lived in Qatar for nearly 12 years, said the Super Eagles’ failure to qualify was heartbreaking and hit him financially. .“I had placed an order for 20,000 Nigerian national team jerseys, which I knew would be in high demand. I was also making plans to host the first ever Nigerian entertainment and fashion week here in Qatar during the World Cup,” Romeo told Al Jazeera. .“The event would’ve featured some of the best Afrobeats artists, comedians and fashion designers to showcase and promote the Nigerian entertainment and fashion industries.” .However, Romeo added, due to the team’s failure to qualify, “the order for the national team jerseys was cancelled and the events were put on hold while we work out how to modify it to fit in other African countries qualified for the tournament”. .Nigeria has been at six World Cups since its maiden appearance at USA 1994. Since then, the team qualified for all World Cup tournaments apart from Germany 2006. .According to Bukola Aliu, secretary of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA) Lagos zone, the team’s absence from the World Cup has affected sales and travel packages put in place since November 2021. .“Many people expressed an interest in touring Qatar as well,” Aliu told Al Jazeera from Lagos. “The demand has reduced because most people are no longer interested.” .Emmanuel Nwachukwu of BFD Global Travels in Qatar said his business has been affected as well. .“We, like other Nigerians, are disappointed because our business strategy was heavily geared towards Nigerian visitors, but demand for tickets from Nigeria is extremely low now.” .Restauranteur Abo Chebib, of Mama’s Place in Qatar, which has been the official gastronomic partner of the community group Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO) in Qatar, told Al Jazeera she no longer receive enquiries about Qatar from international Nigerian fans. .“The World Cup is about more than just the 32 teams. It’s about tourism, culture, food, investment and having a good time. From all indications, fewer Nigerians will travel to Qatar, which will have an impact on our business, given that we have spent many years preparing for the World Cup,” Chebib said. .In Qatar’s music and entertainment sector, popular Nigerian DJ Walex said the team’s absence was a major shock because it would have afforded the opportunity to host parties and invite Nigerian artists to visit Qatar and join Davido, who was part of the Hayya Hayya, the first single of the multi-song World Cup 2022 official soundtrack. .While Nigerian music is popular in Qatar, DJ Walex believes it had the potential of reaching a different level altogether. .“We recently hosted an African comedy festival with popular Nigerian comedians such as Emmanuella and Aunty Success, which drew a large audience. A World Cup appearance for Nigeria would have been magical because it would have created an atmosphere to attract top Nigerian artists to Qatar who have a large following in the country.” .According to Ayodeji Bolorunduro, owner of African Hub, a media and consulting firm in Qatar, negative fallout is happening for many businesses, including media, branding and publicity. .“When a team like Nigeria, with a total population of about 200 million, goes missing, it affects a lot of businesses and sectors at home and abroad,” Bolorunduro said. “It has cost me in advertising, branding and publishing. Nigerians consume a lot of media and entertainment, so the gap is significant.” .The supporters’ club has also been hit hard. .Samuel Ikpea, national chairman of the Nigeria Football Supporters Club (NFSC), expressed regret and described the implication of the country’s non-qualification for the World Cup as enormous in both business and sports worlds. .“It would have been an unforgettable and memorable experience. We had planned to launch the supporters club in Doha the day before the World Cup draw, but it did not happen because we were all consumed by disappointment. .“A lot of businessmen who had started making plans or programmes believing that the country will be at the World Cup are now counting their losses.” .Dominic Ibhagbe, a Nigerian real estate businessman in Qatar, said he had “rented two villas from June to December with the intention of hosting about 30 Nigerians with music, food and services”. .“But I have lost significantly. My hope is to host other nationals, but the difference will be obvious,” he added. .For the national football team, the losses are far greater. Aside from a drop in FIFA rankings, there is a significant loss of income now and in the future. .The team will miss out on $12.5m from FIFA for failing to qualify – a $2.5m preparation fee plus $10m for qualifying for the group stages. .According to Amaju Pinnick, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president, the team would have received 35 percent ($4.4m) of the proceeds, meaning that the federation and the players have not only lost a significant amount right now but also face a loss of revenue in different sectors in the future. .The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), organisers of the World Cup 2022, has invited the Nigerian community to submit cultural activation proposals. .According to a statement by the Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO), the SC stated that depending on the type of performance by Nigerian artists, it will be able to accommodate international artists and offer them a minimum of 10 days of performance. .“The prospect of some Nigerian cultural performances in some of the fan zones is exciting, but nothing beats the agony of missing the World Cup,” NIDO said. .“Nigerians are big spenders, and their absence in Qatar will have an impact not only on the host country’s commerce and trade, but also on the multiplier effect of other businesses in Nigeria, too.”",718

We just felt so privileged to be here,” 67-year-old Ross Finch, who attended the match with his 59-year-old wife Maggie, told Al Jazeera. .“We have been in a few World Cups now … but this time we just did not get it together in time and were very worried about qualifying.” .Australia, who are headed to their fifth consecutive World Cup, complete Group D which also features France, Denmark and Tunisia in the tournament that kicks off on November 21. . .As kickoff approached on Monday, it was apparent that the stadium, one of the eight venues hosting the upcoming World Cup, will be dominated by Peruvian fans. .One Australian spectator before kickoff described it as a “home game” for the South American nation. .Peruvians from across the globe attended the do-or-die game, coming from places including the United States, Peru’s capital Lima and Qatar’s neighbour, the United Arab Emirates. .In Lima, and other Peruvian cities like Cuzco, thousands of fans had lined up the streets to watch their team compete, a task made easier by the government which had declared a national holiday on Monday. .However, what many were hoping to be a second consecutive World Cup qualification, turned out to be a bitter experience. .“I think Peru played horrible, like really bad,” Samuel Chamochumbyi, a marketing graduate and business owner from Lima, told Al Jazeera. .“The team is good … but today they were horrible. Their attack was almost nothing. If you look at the statistics, they had maybe one shot on target,” adding if the match goes to penalties “it was like roulette … anything can happen”. .Nevertheless, for fans like Beraun, the loss is unlikely to translate into a loss of support for their team going forward. .“They [Peruvians] will always support their team. I mean look how many people showed up here … they all came from so far,” she said. .Australia’s coach Graham Arnold said “no one in Australia gave us a chance” and that he was “quite speechless” after the win. .“The mentality of the boys since they came into camp here was fantastic. And I can be so, proud and happy for the players.” .Mark Mead, an Australian residing in Doha, said the result was “fantastic”, adding that up until the last penalty he was not sure if the Socceroos could pull it off. .“It was 50-50 throughout the game,” Mead added. .The Australian, who has been living in Doha for eight years, said he will be attending Tuesday’s World Cup playoff game between Costa Rica and New Zealand as well, also scheduled to take place at the same venue to decide the final team for the 32-team tournament.",726

Thankyou for joining us on this epic journey that lasted 120 minutes and 10 penalty kicks. .It’s a wrap from us. Congratulations to Australia for reaching their fifth successive World Cup… much will be talked about in the morning of that tactical substitution to bring on Redmayne. .We will be back tomorrow for the final qualifying game between Costa Rica and New Zealand. Until then, it’s goodnight (or good morning, and a lovely morning it must be, in Australia). .You can read our match wrap here. . .Since taking charge of Peru in 2015, Gareca rightfully earned widespread praise. The Argentinian earned the team a third place Copa America finish in 2015 before following that up with a runners-up finish in 2019 while also qualifying the nation for the 2018 World Cup. .Today’s result means that Peru will not be playing in back-to-back World Cups. .Australian coach Arnold is clearly emotional in his post-match interview and understandably so. He came under scathing criticism due to Australia’s inconsistent performances since he became the team’s coach in 2018. .“Andrew Redmayne is a very good penalty saver, and to try to get him on the mental aspect while we were making that change, to add that bit of uncertainty in their brains, that was, yeah, that is the reason,” said Arnold in his post match interview. .Meanwhile Arnold has also reiterated that the criticism he has received has not bothered him. .“The doubters don’t bother me, it is these boys I care for, the game I care for. I do it for my family and I want to dedicate this one to my brother, Colin. When my parents died when I was young, I didn’t have anyone really to support. My older brother has been that my whole life, and he is No 1,” he added. .Australian coach Arnold made a big decision to replace Mat Ryan with Andrew Redmayne. It paid off as the substitute goalie made two key saves to see Australia home to a fifth consecutive World Cup in Qatar this November. .They were bigger and mightier in numbers but Australia’s substitute goal-keeper managed to get the loudest cheer of his side’s supporters at the final kick of the game. .Australia will be coming back to Qatar in November.

The game ended in an entertaining 0-0 draw. .Australia❌ ⚽ ⚽ ⚽⚽ ⚽ .Peru ⚽ ⚽ ❌ ⚽ ⚽ ❌ .It’s approaching midnight here in Qatar but nobody is prepared to leave the stadium… and understandably so. .There’s a place at the World Cup at stake and everyone wants to witness the moment it was sealed for their team. Plenty of nail-biting and nervousness awaits as the players regroup just before penalty kicks decide who comes back here in November – Faras Ghani at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. . .Australia replace Mat Ryan in goal with Andrew Redmayne. This is a big call from Australia coach Graham Arnold. It was definitely made with penalties in mind as Ryan showed no signs of injury. .Australia also brought on Goodwin for Behich. .Cueva cannot go on! .Moments after having hit a pass too strong and into the hands of Australian goalkeeper Ryan, Cueva is stretchered off the field and replaced by Alex Valera. This could be a blow for Peru as Cueva is likely to have been one of their penalty takers. .Both coaches now seriously need to think about who will be taking penalties. .Flores nearly won it twice for Peru. First he made a good run before rather unselfishingly playing in a cut-back towards Cueva whose shot was not on target. Lapadula felt he should have been picked out. .Then two minutes later, Flores meets a cross with his head. He beats Ryan but is unlucky to see his effort hit the post. Australia escape. .The game still looks set for penalties but with both teams tiring, a single moment of brilliance could win it for either side. Get set, we will see shots in the second period of extra time. .Both sets of fans are understandably nervous. . .Peru finally had their first shot on target but the effort from Flores was too easy for Ryan who made a comfortable save. .In perhaps what was the closest to goal any team so far came, Behich nearly scored a stunner which would have given Australia the lead in the 84th minute. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .The game looks set for penalties but Peru look to have more urgency in their attack. Cueva could have done better with his cross aimed towards Flores which was gathered by Ryan. .Australia made a reinforcement as Karacic was on for Atkinson. .As he did in the first half, Lapadula kicks off for Peru. Tense moments are ahead for both teams. One will be through to the World Cup soon. .There is nothing between the sides as we head into extra time. The score is a fair reflection of what transpired in the game. Peru’s play did not go according to plan as it was clearly Australia who had the better chances. Of Australia’s 10 shots, two were on target. None of Peru’s five shots have been on target. The Peruvians will have to put their scoring boots on in extra time or penalties if they want to prevail. .Most of the Peruvian fans are on their feet… looking rather anxious. A sigh of relief after Australians are unable to convert a free-kick and extremely frustrated with Peru missing any close chances. More excitement now showing from the Australian fans as they come close to scoring.. definitely a more spring in the camp than in the first half – Usaid Siddiqui at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. .Both teams are now showing signs of fatigue as Australia came very close to taking the lead in the last 10 minutes. Australia look to inject some spark into their attack as Jamie Maclaren is on for Leckie. .There will be three minutes of stoppage time. .Australia fans, meanwhile, seem a bit subdued… perhaps overwhelmed by the loud and mighty Peru fans? Australia managed a shot which was JUST off target.. but that has seemed to spur on the Peru fans even more! .Hrustic goes for goal directly from a free-kick for Australia. His shot is weak and fails to cause any trouble for Gallese in goal for Peru. .Peru make their second change of the game as Sergio Pena is replaced Pedro Aquino. .There is very little time remainng and we will see a few nervous moments in the remaining time of this game. .There are just over 15 minutes of normal time remaining. Neither side has so far shown significantly stronger attacking intent as compared to the first half. The Peru fans remain energetic and loud but we have yet to see our first shot on target or any clear cut chances. .Australia 0-0 Peru .Australia appealed for a penalty after claiming that Boyle’s cross was handled by a Peru defender. Play goes on. Meanwhile, the Australians also make their first change as Awer Mabil is on for Mitchell Duke. The move sees Lechie replacing Duke as Australia’s man up front. .Australia 0-0 Peru .Peru make their first change of the evening as DC United winger Edison Flores comes on, replacing André Carrillo who did not have the best of shifts. They will be hoping for Flores to inject some energy into their attack. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .Usaid is hunting down these fans thick and fast. Now he has an Australian fan Maria Jose who said she felt Australia was doing “pretty well” considering all the support for Peru in the stadium. .Asked if Australia will win, she said “absolutely”. .Jose, who is Chilean, said she is moving to Australia to be with her fiance in Melbourne and hence her support for the Socceroos. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .Australian goalkeeper and captain Mat Ryan has to come out to make a vital save as Peña sends in a cross towards Gonzales. Ryan comes out as the Peru attacker failed to control the ball properly. Minutes earlier, Mooy dragged a shot wide of goal from about 20 yards out. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .Usaid speaks to Peru fan Anna Sonia Venatea who is “very nervous” as the Australians are defending “very well”. .“They know better… since the Peruvians are very quick with the ball,” the 51-year-old, who came with her family from Dubai for the game, said. .“It’s been so nerve-wrecking in the first half. There are so many Peruvians here all hoping the team wins. The Australians are so organised … if we lose I’ll be pretty depressed for a while.” .We are back underway .One of the two teams could be 45 minutes away from securing a place in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar this November. .Australia 0-0 Peru .Atkinson of Australia was the only player to see yellow for a wild challenge on Cueva. Neither side can afford a red-card in this vital game. .Australia 0-0 Peru .Socceroos fan Charles Webb says it’s hard to tell who will win and is hoping for “the best”. .“Its a knockout game. Anything can happen. Both teams will give their best,” the 63-year-old, who lives in Qatar’s capital Doha, said.He added it feels like a “home game for the Peruvians”, pointing at the large number of fans from the South American nation.
“Win or lose, I am here for a good time. At least we made it this far. Italy is not even at the World Cup!” .Australia 0-0 Peru  .The game has been a physical one so far. From the Australian attackers, Boyle and Mooy are the only two who have threatened the Peru defence. Apart from that, the South Americans have effectively dealt with the threat of the opposition. .Peru have only had two shots with none on target. They will be hoping to improve upon this in the second half. Despite having 48% ball possession compared to Peru’s 52%, the Aussies have had six shots with none on target. .Australia will have to contain Advincula’s pace which will be vital to the Peruvian cause in the second half. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .It’s even and was an entertaining opening 45 minutes. Both teams had their fair share of half-chances but will need to be more clinical in the final third during the second half. .It really doesn’t feel like 32C (90F) inside the stadium… well, unless you’re one of the 22 players doing all the running around in the middle.
The organisers started installing the cooling technology when the World Cup was still scheduled for June and July. It will still be used in November and December and by the looks of things tonight, it will come in handy. – Faras Ghani at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. .Boyle once again shows some strong attacking movement, finding Irvine with a cross but the latter sends his headed effort wide. He wasted a good chance and he knows it. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .Peru are playing from the back while Australia are sitting back. From all the Australian players, Martin Boyle looks the best so far as Gonzales comes out while he probes forward. Peru coach Gareca will be the more frustrated of the two tacticians as his side have not yet created any clear cut chances despite looking more composed on the ball. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .Our man Usaid seems to be in a jolly mood with all the music and lovely football on show.

Cueva went down in the penalty area following a duel with Irvine. The ref waves play on. Duke fouls Peña to give Peru a free-kick. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .Neither side is particularly dominating at this point. Both have created chances. As things stand, it looks like it will be a low scoring game with little margin for error. One moment of brilliance could be deciding factor. .Australia 0-0 Peru  .16 Mins .“We are keeping our fingers crossed [that Australia wins],”  Andrew Lee, a fan from Australia, said.
“I don’t rate our chances but we have hope.

We our football crazy in our country. It’s a passion,” said Castilla, who arrived in Qatar with his two friends from DC after a nearly 24-hour flight. .“If we win, we will come back for sure.” .Sam Kerr and Tim Cahill, arguably the two greatest Australian soccer players in modern history have sent in their well wishes. . . .Should the game end in a draw after extra time, penalties are on the cards. .Interestingly, Australia coach Graham Arnold was present at both of the Socceroos competitive shoot-outs. .He was assistant coach to Guus Hiddink when Australia overcame Uruguay on penalties to reach the 2006 World Cup.

730,Published On 2 Jun 2022,Ukraine keeps World Cup hopes alive with victory over Scotland,Ukraine team puts on skillful display to ease past Scotland and now need to beat Wales to advance to finals in Qatar.,".Ukraine kept alive their dream of reaching the World Cup finals by beating Scotland 3-1 in their playoff at Hampden Park on Wednesday in their first game since the Russian invasion of their country. .Ukraine will now face Wales on Sunday in Cardiff with the winner taking a place at November’s finals in Qatar. The loss means Scotland will not have advanced to the finals since 1998. .Goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Roman Yaremchuk had put a confident and dominant Ukraine 2-0 up before Callum McGregor pulled a goal back for the Scots in the 79th minute. .The goal injected some belief into Scotland who applied some late pressure but deep into stoppage time substitute Artem Dovbyk finished off a counterattack to secure the victory. .An emotionally drained Ukraine coach Oleksandr Petrakov said his team had been playing for all those struggling back home. .“We played for them, for those who fight with their last drop of blood, for those who suffer every day,” he said. .“We took baby steps towards our great aim, we have the Wales game to come and we will do everything people expect us to do,” he said. .Ukraine’s travelling support, who had come from across the United Kingdom and from as far away as Australia and the United States to cheer on their team, were jubilant with many no doubt now planning to extend their trip to a weekend in South Wales. .Whether they will be planning trips to Doha after Sunday’s game remains to be seen but they will certainly have plenty of belief after an impressive display. .Ukraine’s domestic competition was halted after the invasion and the country’s home-based players have not played competitive football since December, but they were quick out of the blocks and caused Scotland problems from the outset. .Goalkeeper Craig Gordon made three saves in the opening 25 minutes with Ukraine’s smooth passing and movement too much for a hesitant Scottish defence. .The goal finally came in the 33rd minute when Yarmolenko sprung the offside trap and latched on to a ball over the top from Ruslan Malinovskyi and lobbed the advancing Gordon. .Ukraine extended their advantage four minutes after half-time when Yaremchuk beat two Scottish defenders to reach a cross from Oleksandr Karavaev and head into the far corner of the net. .With the home crowd turning against their team and sloppy passing undermining attempts to gain any sort of momentum, Scotland looked beaten until they found a way back into the game. .Ukraine keeper Georgiy Bushchan punched the ball out in a crowded box and McGregor struck it goalwards and although Taras Stepanenko looked to have cleared, the ball was ruled to have crossed the line and a goal awarded. .Hampden was awakened and with Ukraine tiring, Scotland pushed forward in numbers in search of a way to take the game into extra time. .But after wasting a couple of chances on the break, with the final kick of the match, Dovbyk put the game to bed and set off emotional celebrations. .It was a deserved win for Ukraine and one which came more from their quality football than their expected spirit. .For Scotland, it was a bitter end to their hopes of a first World Cup appearance in 24 years. .“It’s a disappointing night. You have to be honest, the best team of the night won,” said coach Steve Clarke. .“Now is a night to suffer, we’ll suffer together. It’s going to take at least 48 hours just to move on. When you lose a game of this magnitude it hurts,” he added.",730
731,Published On 27 May 2022,Canada pulls out of friendly football game with Iran,Iran has said it will sue Canada’s football authority for breach of contract.,".Tehran, Iran – Canada’s national men’s football team has withdrawn from a football match with Iran scheduled for June 5, after pressure from the Canadian government and the families of a passenger flight downed over Tehran in January 2020. .Canada Soccer, the footballing body that had organised the June 5 World Cup warm-up match, said on Thursday that the game was cancelled because “the untenable geopolitical situation of hosting Iran [had become] significantly divisive”. .“While we considered the external factors in selecting the optimal opponent in our original decision-making process, we will strive to do better moving forward,” it said in a statement. .On January 8, 2020, Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 had just departed Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran when it was targeted by two missiles fired from an air defence battery operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). .The elite force said the incident occurred due to “human error” during a state of alarm that followed its missile attacks on United States bases in Iraq in retaliation for the US assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani. .The Canadian government says 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents were among the 176 people who were killed. .The families of the victims had also alleged that if the friendly match with the Iranian team was allowed to take place, IRGC members would enter Canadian soil under the guise of the national team. .“Like many other activities in Iran, soccer [football] there is controlled by the IRGC, which is expected to send members to accompany the Iranian team to Canada for the exhibition game,” claimed Hamed Esmaeilion, the spokesperson for the association of families, in an op-ed earlier this month. .Meanwhile, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and several other politicians had denounced the decision to host the Iranian team. Trudeau had said last week the game “wasn’t a very good idea” and put the onus on Canada Soccer to make a final decision. .“And in terms of the ability of those players to come to Canada and the teams to come to Canada, the border services agencies make professional and independent decisions on eligibility for people to come to Canada,” he had added. .The Canadian government on Thursday showed its approval for the decision to cancel the match as sports minister Pascale St-Onge welcomed the move. .When asked by Al Jazeera, a spokesperson for the sports ministry refused to comment on the political aspects of the case, saying Canada Soccer should comment as the organiser. Canada Soccer has not yet responded to a request for comment. .The match’s cancellation is likely to carry more long-term ramifications, as there were also financial aspects to consider. .Sina Kalhor, a deputy Iranian sports minister, announced in a tweet on Thursday that the Iranian Football Federation would sue its Canadian counterpart for $10m as it made the decision to cancel the match unilaterally in a contract violation. .“The unilateral cancellation of Iran and Canada’s match by Canada Soccer once more showed that the slogan of not politicising football is only a cover for the interests of Western countries,” he wrote. .Earlier this week, the spokesman of the Iranian foreign ministry, Saeed Khatibzadeh, had said the ministry expects Canada to refrain from politicising the match, adding that the Canadian government and football association would be responsible for any contract violations. .Pressure on Canada Soccer to cancel the match had also mounted after reports emerged earlier this week that the organisation would pay Iran’s football federation $400,000 as part of a standard practice to cover extra expenses such as travelling costs. .Canada Soccer has not publicly discussed the specifics of its contract with the Iranian counterpart, citing a confidentiality clause, but its president Nick Bontis told Canadian media that “no appearance money has been paid to Iran”. .“This behavior by Canada Soccer is repugnant,” Canada’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Ralph Goodale, a former special adviser to Trudeau on the PS725, tweeted earlier this week. “It calls into question both the competence and the values of the organization.” .The match against the Iranian national team would have been a rare chance to test the Canadian team outside of their CONCACAF confederation, which covers the Americas and the Caribbean. .They have only played two matches against teams outside of the CONCACAF since 2018. .The Canadian team, which ranks 38th on FIFA’s current global football ranking, has secured a World Cup spot for the first time in 36 years, emerging as the surprise victor of their regional qualifiers, ahead of Mexico and the United States. .Canada Soccer had said it chose Iran because the team had a similar playing style to Morocco, one of Canada’s opponents in the Qatar tournament. .Iran currently ranks 21st in the men’s football world rankings, ahead of all other Asian teams. The 2022 tournament will mark its third consecutive appearance at the World Cup and its sixth appearance overall. .Iran has drawn a place in Group B of international football’s most important competition, having been paired with the US and the United Kingdom, two of the country’s most bitter political foes. They will be joined by one of either Scotland, Wales or Ukraine.",731
732,Published On 26 May 2022,Gulf airlines to operate shuttle flights for Qatar 2022 World Cup,"Flydubai, Oman Air, Kuwait Airways and Saudia airlines will operate shuttle flights during the World Cup to help ease logistical and accommodation issues.",".Qatar Airways has announced that fellow Gulf Arab airlines will operate more than 160 daily shuttle flights to Qatar during this year’s football World Cup, allowing fans to fly in from nearby cities before a game and return at the end of the day. .Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker told a news conference on Thursday that United Arab Emirates (UAE) airline flydubai, Oman Air, Kuwait Airways and Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) would operate shuttle flights and that the UAE’s Etihad and Air Arabia may also join the scheme. .“Flights will be scheduled to arrive up to five hours before the match [in Doha],” said al-Baker, sitting next to heads of the other airlines. .“After the games, fans will once again have plenty of time to travel through Doha before boarding their flights for home.” .The shuttle flights would alleviate logistical, accommodation and policing pressure on Qatar and allow neighbouring Gulf states to benefit from November’s World Cup, the first to be held in the Middle East. . .“The intention is to make the fan experience as seamless as possible, and ensure that everyone can enjoy the World Cup,” the Qatar Airways CEO said at the press conference. .“I want to thank my fellow CEOs for their vision and perseverance in making this match-day shuttle flights a reality.” .Qatar hopes the tournament will attract roughly 1.2 million visitors, or almost half of the country’s population. .Flydubai will operate up to 60 daily flights from Dubai, the region’s tourism hub, carrying up to 2,500 fans, al-Baker said, while Oman Air will run up to 48 daily flights from Muscat carrying up to 3,400 fans. .Kuwait Airways will run up to 20 flights a day carrying up to 1,700 fans. .Saudia will operate up to 60 daily flights carrying up to 10,000 fans from Riyadh and Jeddah, said CEO Ibrahim Koshy. .Games will take place around Doha, the capital of Qatar, which is the smallest state to have hosted football’s biggest event. .Shuttle flights will allow overseas ticket holders to avoid expensive and limited accommodation in Qatar by staying in other Gulf cities. .The arrangement could also boost Qatar’s ties with its neighbours following the resolution early last year of a political dispute that had seen Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt boycott Doha for more than three years. .In the first round of ticket sales earlier this year, FIFA, football’s world governing body, said it had received 17 million applications, the results of which were announced through a lucky draw. .The World Cup takes place across eight stadiums in Qatar from November 21 to December 18.",732

734,Published On 15 Apr 2022,Football World Cup eliminations dash small business hopes,"From Colombia to Nigeria, traders in football-loving nations are counting the losses of failure to make it to Qatar 2022.",".Colombian food vendor William Abella had been counting on the Qatar World Cup 2022 as an opportunity to offset his losses from long COVID-19 lockdowns. .When the national team plays, his small corner shop and snack bar in central Bogota usually turns into a sea of yellow. Football fans wearing the team’s official shirt gather to drink and chat, lifting beer sales by up to 80 percent. .But like many small traders in footballing countries that unexpectedly failed to qualify, his hopes for bumper business from fans cheering on their side have been dashed. .“With Colombia out of the World Cup, I’m expecting my beer sales to decrease by about half,” said 65-year-old Abella. .The World Cup, which kicks off in November, is big business, generating billions of dollars in consumer spending in tourism, food and drink, merchandise and more. .But as businesses across the world gear up to cash in, developing countries known for their football prowess – yet which failed to qualify – are counting their losses. .From street vendors in Colombia to shopkeepers in Algeria and owners of football viewing halls in Nigeria, small businesses and informal workers who rely on cash-in-hand earnings during football matches fear a big decline in income. .In north Bogota, street vendor Roberto Teyes sold and traded stickers for the Panini football album during the last World Cup, hosted by Russia in 2018. .“There’ll be less interest in collecting stickers as the Colombian team won’t be in the album,” said Teyes, adding he earned up to $130 daily in sticker sales. “I’d hoped for a good end to the year. I really needed it after COVID.” .Merchants association Fenalco estimated the team missing out on the World Cup would result in economic losses of about $810m, mainly due to effects on merchandise sellers, bars, cafés, and travel agencies. .“Colombia’s elimination from the World Cup brings serious consequences for the country’s commerce and tourism,” said Fenalco President Jaime Alberto Cabal. .In the 2018 World Cup, when Colombia reached the last-16, Fenalco members reported a nearly 40 percent rise in beer sales, 20 percent in spirits, 19 percent in TV screens and 12 percent in soft drinks. .In Nigeria, another football-mad nation and home to Africa’s largest population, David Anomweh, who runs a sportswear stall in the commercial capital Lagos, is also in the doldrums. .Much-fancied Nigeria – who have appeared in six of the last seven World Cups – also failed to qualify for Qatar, leaving millions of fans bereft. .The Super Eagles’ shock defeat to staunch rival Ghana not only led to riots by angry fans who stormed the pitch, but has left some businesses and traders reeling. .From shops to cafés, business owners in Lagos had expected to make good profits, and some had already made investments on the presumption the national team would qualify. .“My dad already ordered 50 Nigerian jerseys hoping to begin to sell them if Nigeria qualified,” said Anomweh, manager of Ugo Ways Sports in Lagos’s bustling Yaba market. .“Now Nigerian jerseys in the market are totally useless,” said Anomweh, adding the order had cost 250,000 Naira ($602). .Owners of Nigeria’s popular football viewing halls – large spaces with giant screens where people can pay a fee to watch matches – also complained about revenue losses. .“It’s painful because Nigerians like to watch Nigeria matches compared to club matches,” said Jide Joseph, owner of a hall with a capacity of 80 in Fadeyi, a suburb of Lagos. .Joseph, who has been running the business for 20 years, said he was expecting full capacity for Nigeria games and had expected to earn 10,000 Naira ($23) per match, compared with 700 Naira ($1.7) for other matches. .“Now that Nigeria didn’t qualify, people will not come out to watch other teams. I will not be able to make any money from any match,” he said. .Remi Ugo, owner of the Blue Spot Café, a bar and restaurant in the Shomolu suburb of Lagos, said Nigeria’s failure to qualify would hurt many businesses like his. .“About 80 percent of my customers come here to drink just to watch matches,” he said. “I’m sure people will not turn up much for the World Cup matches.” .In Egypt, home country of Premier League footballer and national hero Mohamed Salah, fans of the beautiful game gather in coffee shops to watch matches. .Moustafa Mehres, a 36-year-old café owner in an eastern Cairo neighborhood, said his daily sales double when the national team plays. .“Instead of having 20 customers during the whole day, I get 40 customers in just two hours,” he said. .In another part of the capital, in Cairo’s historic el-Gamaliya neighbourhood, clothes-shop owner Waleed el-Kurdi, 30, had hoped for a bonanza fueled by the tournament. .During the Egypt-Senegal qualifiers in March, sales at el-Kurdi’s shop were up by 25 percent as fans snapped up T-shirts of Salah along with scarfs and flags of the national team, which failed to qualify. .“My sales reached about 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($109) during the week of the match alone,” he said. .In the Algerian capital, Algiers, Mohamad Bachouch, 59, faces a similar problem at his small shop after stockpiling Algerian flags, shirts and mugs with the names of national team football players. .“When Algeria got knocked out, tears streamed from my eyes because I knew I had lost a lot,” said Bachouch. “This means I’ll have to keep them until, maybe, the next World Cup.”",734
735,Published On 5 Apr 2022,Football Union of Russia withdraws appeal over FIFA ban,FIFA and UEFA decided all Russian teams would be suspended from participation after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,".The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said the Football Union of Russia (FUR) had withdrawn its appeal against football’s world governing body FIFA as well as the Polish, Swedish and Czech Republic Football Associations. .FIFA and European governing body UEFA decided together that all Russian teams, whether national or club sides, would be suspended from participation in their competitions until further notice after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. .Russia were set to host Poland in a World Cup qualifying playoff on March 24 but FIFA said Poland would be given a bye to the final of their path in the playoffs to play either Sweden or the Czech Republic. .Sport’s highest court said in a statement the procedure would be terminated shortly. It added a panel of arbitrators was currently being constituted and no procedural calendar had been established yet. .Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation”, has also filed appeals seeking annulment of its bans from international gymnastics, rugby, rowing, and skating, CAS said. .Last month, Russia’s hopes of competing at the men’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar were effectively ended after CAS rejected a request from the FUR to freeze FIFA’s suspension while their appeal was being heard. .Several national football associations announced they would not play against Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, including those of Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic. .Poland went on to beat Sweden in their playoff match to qualify for the World Cup finals, which begin in November. .CAS had also upheld UEFA’s ban on Russian teams taking part in its competitions for the duration of its proceedings.",735

740,Published On 31 Mar 2022,Algerian FA files complaint over World Cup qualifier defeat,Algerian football federation demands FIFA order a replay of its match with Cameroon due to the referee’s performance.,".Algeria’s football federation has lodged a complaint with FIFA, football’s world governing body, after it was beaten by Cameroon in a Qatar 2022 World Cup qualification playoff, and called for the match to be replayed. .The move on Thursday came after the football association’s president resigned. Algeria has argued that its defeat on Tuesday – which took place in Algeria’s stadium, Blida – was distorted by the referee’s performance. .“The Algerian Football Federation [FAF] has lodged an appeal with the International Federation of Association Football [FIFA] against the scandalous arbitration which distorted the result of the Algeria-Cameroon play-off return match,” a statement by the FAF read. .“The FAF is determined to use all legally permitted means to have its rights restored and to replay the match under conditions guaranteeing the honesty and partiality of the arbitration,” it said, adding that it has also requested the “opening of an investigation” into the matter. .  .Cameroon secured their place on away goals with the last kick of the match against Algeria, deep into extra time, as Karl Toko Ekambi swept home a speculative cross to win the match 2-1. .Algeria, who had won the first leg in Cameroon 1-0, were left crestfallen by the defeat. .“We were only 10 seconds away from the World Cup. We collapsed,” Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi said after the loss. .“We put our lives on hold for this match and this success and we only had qualification on our minds. It is going to be hard to get through the next days.” .Meanwhile, the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) launched a complaint with FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) against its Senegalese counterpart for violent and “racist” fan behaviour, according to a statement released on Wednesday, after Senegal defeated Egypt in a penalty shoot-out to qualify for Qatar 2022. Egypt is also demanding the match be replayed. .According to the EFA’s statement, “The Egyptian team was subjected to racism as crowds held up offensive banners in the stands, particularly against team captain Mohamed Salah.” .The complaint also said players were pelted with water bottles and stones during their warm-up. .There was widespread criticism online about the crowd shining green lasers in the faces of the players during the game. Those lasers were notably seen on Salah before his penalty miss. .Usher Komugisha, an African football journalist, said both Algeria and Egypt’s appeals are unlikely to succeed. .“When you look at the history of how FIFA has handled cases like this, they’ll have to prove that there was malpractice or that there was corruption with the referee,” Komugisha told Al Jazeera. .“Also you have to give credit to Bakary Papa Gassama [who officiated Algeria v Cameroon], he’s one of the top three best referees on the African continent – he knows what he’s doing,” she said.",740
741,Published On 31 Mar 2022,What happened at the 72nd FIFA Congress in Qatar?,"Human rights, the Russia-Ukraine war and biennial World Cup plans are some of the issues that surfaced in Doha.",".Doha, Qatar – The 72nd FIFA Congress has taken place in Doha, the capital of Qatar, which is set to host the 2022 football World Cup. .Thursday’s Congress was the first in-person annual event of football’s world governing body since 2019 due to the coronavirus pandemic. .Here are some of the highlights from the event: .Questions and concerns over Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers took centre stage at the conference. .Norwegian Football Federation President Lise Klaveness took to the stage during the Congress and termed the awarding of the tournament to Qatar in 2010 “unacceptable”. .Meanwhile, FIFA President Gianni Infantino pointed to “the changes that have happened in this country” as a positive sign towards Qatar being awarded the World Cup. .Hassan al-Thawadi, chief of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, said labour reforms achieved by Qatar have been “historical” and the event would leave “truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies”. .The FIFA president also seemingly stepped back from plans of hosting a World Cup every two years. .Infantino’s ambition to make the World Cup a biennial tournament has been under fire, but at the Congress he told member nations that FIFA had not been proposing the move but rather aiming to look into its feasibility. .“FIFA has not proposed a biennial World Cup,” he said. “The majority voted in the last Congress to start feasibility for this. After feasibility, the next phase starts where we find agreements and reach a compromise. .“We try to have debate and discuss to see what is suitable for everyone. Everyone has to benefit.” .While Russia’s national team was thrown out of the World Cup qualifiers and its club sides banned from competitions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the country’s football federation was allowed to be part of the Congress on Thursday. .Answering a question on why the federation was not barred and suspended from FIFA, Infantino said: “Russia has a football union. Like any other federation, [it] has not been suspended, as such, by FIFA. It has been participating in this congress as well, because if we don’t have occasions to bring people together like a congress, then we’d rather stop and go home.” .Alexey Sorokin, adviser to the Russian football chief, meanwhile, backed its presence at the Congress, saying: “What does Russian football have to do with all this? What has Russian football done wrong? I don’t find any clauses in the FIFA statutes that were broken by Russian football.” .A three-minute video message was aired at the Congress from the head of Ukraine’s football federation, Andriy Pavelko. .Pavelko wore an armoured vest as he spoke from the capital Kyiv while behind him people packed sandbags several metres high to protect a monument. .“Unfortunately, I cannot be with you today. Since February 24, we have not had the opportunity to develop our beloved game.

These basic rights were pressured on to the field as substitutes, mainly by outside voices. .“FIFA has addressed these issues, but there is still a long way to go. The migrant workers injured or families of those who died in the build up to the World Cup must be cared for. FIFA, all of us, must take all necessary measures to really implement change.” .Her speech was followed by remarks from Hassan al-Thawadi, chief of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, who said labour reforms achieved by Qatar have been “historical” and the event would leave “truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies”. .“Through taking time to understand complexities on the ground and a shared commitment, once adversaries have now became our allied partners,” al-Thawadi said. .“We have showcased to the world what a tournament being hosted in a country can achieve. Legacy is being delivered as we speak. Going forward, organisations will look towards us as a benchmark on how to utilise these tournaments to leave a legacy. .“What we say is what we’re offering them, providing a safe World Cup, a welcoming World Cup for everybody. And this is the opportunity for everybody to sit down and build relations.” .In August 2020, Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for an NOC – employer’s permission to change jobs – that rights activists said tied workers’ presence in the country to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .Qatar’s Government Communication Office (GCO) has told Al Jazeera in the past that the country “has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs… to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective”.",742

William Troost-Ekong levelled from the penalty spot, but Nigeria missed several clear chances to win the match at the Moshood Abiola Stadium. .There had been signs of trouble before the match as crushes had built up outside the 60,000-capacity stadium barely an hour before kick-off, with thousands of ticketless fans approaching different gates. .There was a surge and stampede at one of the entrances after police officers began turning fans away. A journalist who tried to capture the scene was allegedly attacked by the police. .“You think watching Nigeria play a football match is worth losing my life and properties for,” one angry fan shouted. “I was beaten like a thief by the police even though I have a ticket. I will never come back here again.” .Many fans with executive and VIP tickets which cost 25,000 naira ($60) were locked out and unable to enter the stadium before kick-off. Some officials with state box tickets were shocked as state police prevented them from going inside the stadium. .Away from the VIP entrance, fights broke out in the overcrowded terraces, with some reports suggesting 75,000 fans managed to enter the stadium. Local journalists came face to face with fans who invaded the media section. .At the final whistle, fans reacted to the result by throwing objects at both the small group of visiting fans and the Ghana players, and invaded the pitch – where both sets of players were left to battle their own way towards the tunnel as fans charged at them. Fans also smashed the doors leading to the presidential box and overturned two dugouts. .The police hit the pitch invaders with their batons, and fired tear gas on the pitch to disperse them. .Cars parked outside the stadium were vandalised and properties stolen, while some vehicles parked near the exit doors had windows, wing mirrors and lights smashed. Attacks outside the ground were reported by local media, with some fans having their mobile phones stolen. .Journalist Uche Nwudoh told Al Jazeera that the disturbances were “embarrassing and sad to witness” and blamed security forces for failing to control the crowd. .“I don’t think it makes sense to mess a big day like this up for those who only came to support their national team,” Nwudoh said. “What message are we sending to those who are planning to come to the stadium in the future?” .For some, it was a déjà vu moment at the stadium. Back in October 2011, Nigeria’s 2-2 home draw against Guinea in a 2012 Nations Cup qualifier meant the hosts failed to qualify for the continental event for the first time since 1986. .Stadium doors were shattered, and VIP entrance glasses broken by angry fans. They also pelted the team bus with heavy stones, leaving some players with minor injuries. .Nigeria could face sanctions from world football’s governing body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), after this latest crowd trouble at the same venue. .Meanwhile, a doping officer on duty at the match died from a suspected cardiac arrest after the game’s full time, contrary to rumours on social media he was beaten to death by irate fans. Attempts to resuscitate Joseph Kabungo failed, and the Zambian official was pronounced dead after arriving at a hospital in Abuja, according to the Nigeria Football Association (NFF). .An NFF statement said Kabungo was found “gasping for breath near the dressing room of the Ghanaian team” while on his way to find a Ghana player for a doping test. .“We mourn the passing of our CAF [Confederation of African Football] and FIFA medical officer Dr Joseph Kabungo and we extend our sincere condolences to Dr Kabungo’s family and the football family at large,” Football Association of Zambia President Andrew Kamanga said. .“He was a dedicated and widely loved member of our football community and his impact was vast, having also been part of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations winning team.” .Former African footballer of the year and Zambia football legend Kalusha Bwalya wrote on Twitter that he has lost a brother and courageous man.",743

We’re going to keep going. We’ve only just got started.” .After a strong qualifying campaign had left them three points clear with two games remaining, Canada needed only a point from Sunday’s fixture to assure themselves of qualification. .That objective was never in doubt as Canada’s Les Rouges went on the attack against Jamaica’s Reggae Boyz from the whistle. .Larin could have opened the scoring after only five minutes, but his shot after Jonathan David’s surging run and pass was well saved by Jamaican goalkeeper Andre Blake. But Larin made no mistake in the 13th minute to bag Canada’s opener. .A lovely team move ended with former Portugal Under-21 international Stephen Eustaquio splitting the Jamaica defence to find Larin, who calmly tucked away the finish to spark raucous celebrations. .The remainder of the half was only a question of when Canada would add to their lead as wave after wave of red-shirted players laid siege to Jamaica’s goal. .David should have doubled Canada’s lead on 15 minutes but shot wide from eight yards and in the 21st minute, Buchanan squandered a gilt-edged opportunity, scooping his shot over the bar. .Jonathan Osorio went close with a deflected shot in the 34th minute, and Buchanan then missed another opportunity from Osorio’s cross. .Larin was the next to miss on 38 minutes, guiding his shot just wide of the post to leave Herdman howling in disbelief on the sidelines. But just when it looked as if Jamaica might restrict Canada to one first-half goal, their resistance was finally broken. .David crossed from the far post, Buchanan lost his marker, took a touch and buried his finish into the bottom corner. That sent the home crowd into party mode and Canada’s dominance continued throughout the second half, with the hosts carving out chance after chance only to be let down by their finishing. .Finally, however, the dominance paid off seven minutes from time when English Championship player Junior Hoilett collected a pass from Buchanan and coolly placed his finish beyond Blake for 3-0. .There was still time for Canada to grab a fourth when the London-born left-back Sam Adekugbe launched yet another powerful foray down the flank. The defender’s cross into space was met by Jamaica defender Mariappa, who sliced his finish into his own goal for 4-0. .“We’ve been through some tough times,” Herdman said. “I’ve knocked on doors to ask for money for this team, and we did it. And we just kept believing. .“I’m just happy for these lads. When I first took over and I said, ‘We’re going to qualify for the World Cup,’ I don’t think they believed us. I’m happy for them because all of these fans have waited and waited and waited, and hung in with us — and we’re going.”",744

746,Published On 25 Mar 2022,‘Noooo’: How Italy reacted to team missing out on Qatar World Cup,European champions and 2006 world champions miss out on second successive World Cup after playoff loss.,".Eight months after winning the European Championship and being feted as national heroes, Italy’s football team crashed back to earth, missing out on the World Cup for the second time running. .Italy lost 1-0 at home to little-fancied North Macedonia who scored the winner in injury time on Thursday. .It was a shock repeat of four years ago, when Italy failed to reach football’s global showpiece tournament for the first time since 1958. .But after the team’s victory in the European final against England last July, few people believed a repeat calamity was looming. .“Out of the world” was La Gazzetta dello Sport’s, the major sports newspaper in Italy, headline on Friday morning. .“Taking Roberto Mancini [team manager] to trial is a mistake. It’s the entire football system that needs to be rebuilt,” said an opinion piece in the newspaper. .Media reports suggest Mancini, who was hailed as Italy’s saviour after taking the side from World Cup omission to Euros glory, will probably leave. .“Let’s see,” said Mancini. “The disappointment is too big at present to talk about the future. I just don’t know what to say.” .Most of the big-name players, including the 2006 World Cup winners, remained silent and it was hard to find posts or comments on social media from the current players. .Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport respectively had “To Hell” and “Noooooooooo” as headlines, with numerous articles of why the team lost the match and how the team’s performance got worse after the final in London last summer. .Italy have won the World Cup four times, including the 2006 triumph. However, they exited at the group stage in 2010 and 2014, and this latest setback suggested that the European triumph in 2021 was merely a blip in a prolonged period of decline. .“All the Gazzetta dello Sport were almost sold out early in the morning,” Christian, 50, owner of a newspaper kiosk in south-central Milan, told Al Jazeera. .“Those who bought the newspapers were angry and sad. But this time it was different from 2018 mainly for two reasons. Firstly, people are concerned about the war in Ukraine and football, even here in Italy, is not a priority these days. Secondly, we have gotten used to not making it to the World Cup.” .For the last two seasons, no Italian teams have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, a trophy which has eluded Italy since 2010, with many domestic clubs weighed down by debt and unable to attract the top talent that once flocked to Serie A. .The newly appointed head of the top-flight Serie A league acknowledged that a shake-up was needed. .“This failure… must lead everyone to serious reflection and profound change in our system,” said Lorenzo Casini, without giving details of what needed doing. .For 64-year-old Nunzio, it was the same feeling as the rest of Italy. .“This is what they deserve because they played really bad yesterday,” he told Al Jazeera. “Of course I am disappointed, I love football and I always support Azzurri but after Euro 2020, we did not do anything to deserve qualification. Macedonia was much better than us yesterday, I am happy for them.”",746
747,Published On 25 Mar 2022,Salah-Mane rivalry highlights Africa’s Qatar World Cup playoffs,Two-legged playoffs set to kick off on Friday as five teams from Africa will qualify for Qatar 2022.,".Africa’s World Cup playoffs will serve up a Mohamed Salah versus Sadio Mane sequel as the Liverpool teammates face off on opposite sides again with their countries, this time for a place at football’s biggest show. .Salah’s Egypt will face Mane’s Senegal in one of the continent’s five decisive World Cup playoffs, with the first leg in Cairo on Friday. .The draw for the playoffs was made before the two Liverpool stars met in last month’s African Cup of Nations final, which was won by Senegal in a shoot-out thanks to Mane’s winning penalty. .The second leg is at Senegal’s new 50,000-seat Abdoulaye Wade Stadium on Tuesday. .Egypt versus Senegal headlines the playoffs but there is also a big West African derby pitting Ghana against Nigeria. .The five winners of the two-legged ties will seal progress to Qatar 2022. .Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recognised the significance of the game when he rested Mane for Sunday’s FA Cup quarterfinal against Nottingham Forest because Salah was already out with a minor injury. .“Because the game is too big in Africa,” Klopp said. .Senegal coach Aliou Cisse has largely kept faith with the players that became African champions in Cameroon earlier this year when considering his squad. .Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz challenged Salah and his teammates to succeed this time “because there is no room for sorrys or tomorrows”. .Four-time African champions and former World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana are in damage control following an embarrassing group-stage exit at the African Cup at the hands of Comoros. .Ghana have new leadership in head coach Otto Addo and technical adviser Chris Hughton after Milovan Rajevac was fired for the African Cup failure. The team is without captain Andre Ayew because of his red card in that loss to Comoros. .Nigeria were at times impressive at the African Cup and has been strengthened by the return of strikers Victor Osimhen and Odion Ighalo, who were both unavailable for that tournament. .Like Ghana, Algeria have to restore their reputation after a dire defence of their African title in Cameroon, when they finished bottom of the group without winning a game. .Veteran striker Baghdad Bounedjah and midfielder Yassine Brahimi have been dropped from the squad by coach Djamel Belmadi. .Cameroon are now coached by former national captain Rigobert Song, who was appointed a month ago with the support of new Cameroon federation president Samuel Eto’o, his former teammate. .The Indomitable Lions’ buildup has been complicated by goalkeeper Andre Onana’s involvement in a serious car crash this week – he escaped unhurt – and the unavailability of key midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa because of injury. .DR Congo could be the story of the playoffs if they surprise Morocco to reach the World Cup for the first time since their only previous appearance at the 1974 tournament as Zaire. .That may be remembered for the 9-0 loss to Yugoslavia that still shares the record as the World Cup’s biggest defeat. But this Congo team is led by experienced Argentine coach Hector Cuper and can call on former Belgium youth player Theo Bongonda for the first time after the winger switched allegiance to his parents’ country of birth in January. .Morocco are the clear favourite to advance even without Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech, who has turned down a recall because of his continuing feud with coach Vahid Hallihodzic. .Mali are the only one of the 10 playoff contenders to have never played at a World Cup before. .They have now been able to call up two former France under-21 players in Eintracht Frankfurt defender Almamy Toure and Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure against Tunisia.",747
748,Published On 25 Mar 2022,World Cup: Cisse in the spotlight as Senegal eye Qatar 2022 spot,"Former captain led Senegal to AFCON triumph last month. Now, the team must beat Egypt again to qualify for the World Cup.",".For Aliou Cisse, Senegal’s first-ever Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title earlier this year offered only a brief respite. .Since taking over as the national team’s head coach seven years ago, the 45-year-old has lived under almost suffocating pressure, tasked at every turn with returning the national team to the same heights as the 2002 team – which he captained. .Finally winning, at the third time of asking, in Cameroon last month, and beating Egypt in the AFCON final, Cisse’s place in the pantheon of Senegalese football was cemented definitively. However, his job security was not. .Detailed in his contract is a second provision that must be met: A place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .So, for the second time in two months, the former PSG and Portsmouth player has a “final” to prepare for. Once again, it is Egypt standing in the way, this time across two legs. .“We are facing two finals which are important for Senegalese football,” Cisse said. “These games against Egypt, the team that we have just beaten on penalties in the AFCON final, are still very difficult.” .Egypt, aiming to reach its fourth World Cup, will host the first leg in Cairo on March 25 with the return leg in Dakar four days later. .When Senegal appointed Cisse in March 2015, the country’s football was at its lowest ebb. .Under previous coach Alain Giresse, Senegal had failed to progress beyond the group stage at that year’s AFCON. It had been three World Cups since the team’s debut at the tournament in 2002 and, despite having a promising crop of talent coming through the youth system, Senegal were in dire need of quality in key positions. .Cisse, with his brand of quiet leadership, was tapped for the job following his work with the under-23s at the 2012 London Olympics. .The scale of the rebuild, though ambitious, was key to winning hearts and minds. .“When I became their coach in 2015, I told them our target is to reach the World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations final,” he told CAF Online. .Now, with the likes of Sadio Mane, Idrissa Gueye, Saliou Ciss and Cheikhou Kouyate rising through the ranks, and diaspora talent like Kalidou Koulibaly, Edouard Mendy, Boulaye Dia and Abdou Diallo added into the mix, Senegal have a talented pool to choose from and also shot up in the FIFA world rankings. .But with the improvement and the ambition came pressure. .Cisse can be cast as a victim of his own success, both as a player and a manager. .The team’s historic record of underachievement in African football is well documented. However, in reaching the AFCON final and World Cup quarter-finals, both in 2002, the proud footballing nation got a taste for mixing it up with the heavyweights of African and world football. .The ensuing two decades have been spent in frustration at their inability to build on that and putting together their most talented team since has only served to amplify those frustrations. .Chief among Cisse’s critics have been his former international teammates. .When Senegal failed to progress from the 2018 World Cup group stages, El-Hadji Diouf was vocal in his disapproval. .“Winning cannot be achieved if Aliou Cisse remains at the helm of the national team,” he said. .Another former international, Amdy Faye, questioned the psychology of the team. .“We do not have a winning mentality. We have it at 50 percent during the final stages, but to go for the Cup, you need it all the way,” he told France24. “That’s the problem. For this, we must force destiny, and that’s why we put the emphasis on this generation.” .Reaching the 2019 AFCON final, in which the Teranga Lions were beaten by Algeria, was not even enough to turn the tide of negative criticism, which metastasised into dissatisfaction about a style of play that was deemed too rudimentary, regardless of the results. .Cisse is known for his quiet disposition and acceptance of pressure as “part of football”. But even he felt the need to retort. .“I accept criticism when it’s constructive. They must first accept that I am the national coach and that I make the decisions. After that there is no problem, we can discuss,” he said. .“I speak with some of them and they have their own vision, but I’m the coach. Especially that they are not even trainers, so they should let me do my job.” .Perhaps the biggest indicator of the amount of pressure Cisse has had to live with was the statement by Augustin Senghor, president of the Senegal FA (FSF), on the eve of the AFCON final. .Against all of the scepticism that had dogged Cisse, Senghor had been an important voice, fighting the corner of the national team boss, while still setting ambitious targets. .His response to Diouf’s criticism was to dismiss it as provoked by bitterness, and he was only too happy to renew the former captain’s contract despite the disappointing eliminations from the 2017 AFCON and 2018 World Cup. .In doing so, he pointed to Cisse’s work in “bringing the Senegalese team up to an appreciable level” and described him as “one of the best coaches in the world”. .Going into the AFCON in Cameroon this year, even Senghor appeared to break character. .“As big as Senegal is regarded in African football, we cannot continue to be content with participating and getting moral victory of second place,” he told Al Jazeera. .“Senegal must win and the coach understands the goal and objective.” .And even as the Teranga Lions booked their place in the final, Senghor stated that anything less than victory against Egypt would count as a “failure”. .That triumph in Cameroon has seen many people curtail their criticism of Cisse. .His demeanour has now come to be looked upon as a virtue. .“He is a big brother to his players and never gets carried away,” former teammate Salif Diao said. The country’s president, Macky Sall, praised him for his “quiet strength and imperturbable serenity”. .Even Diouf has softened. Perhaps Cisse’s willingness to extend a conciliatory hand, bringing him into the national team fold as a sort of ambassador, played a major role. .“As a player, he spoke less and performed more,” the two-time African Player of the Year told Al Jazeera. “The reason he’s so different is that strong ability to speak only when it matters.” .That success, and the belated acknowledgement that has accompanied, was built on a sense of family and team spirit. .Cisse described his relationship with the players as akin to a father-son one, and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy hailed the “team spirit and the team effort” as “what makes Senegal special under his guidance”. .When Senegal lifted the AFCON trophy earlier this year, Mane, who scored the decisive penalty, dedicated the victory to the coach. .“This trophy is a result of the manager’s commitment to his team and it is heartwarming for us to win it for him, our people and the country.” .This newfound love will be put to the test very quickly against Egypt. .Cisse has largely kept the team that was triumphant in Cameroon, favouring continuity for what is a tense, unpredictable encounter. .For this second final across two legs, the stakes are even higher for Senegal: A place at the World Cup but also the continuation of Cisse’s long-term project.",748

There will be fan villages at four different locations. Accommodation options will also be available through vacation homes and visitors have the option of staying with friends and family.” .An SC official confirmed to Al Jazeera that organisers had block-booked 80 percent of the hotels and accommodation options across the country which will be available to ticket holders. . .Given the expected influx of fans and tourists, there are concerns that Qatar may not be able to offer enough accommodation to visitors, especially those without tickets and wanting to experience the World Cup and the country’s culture at various areas away from the stadiums, including public areas and fan zones. .The organisers, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera earlier this year, said that “with up to 130,000 rooms for the one million-plus fans expected over the course of the 28-day tournament, there are no concerns over a shortfall of accommodation”. .However, al-Jaber was unable to answer Al Jazeera’s question on whether the SC was confident there would be enough accommodation for all those arriving in Qatar, instead pointing fans with valid tickets to visit the portal at the earliest to get the best prices and availability. .An SC official later confirmed to Al Jazeera that “the priority right now [for accommodation requests] are the ticket holders”. .“We anticipate a number of visiting fans will stay with friends or family during the tournament. Qatar’s compact tournament footprint will also mean teams and fans need only one accommodation for the duration of the tournament,” according to the SC statement.",749

751,Published On 26 Feb 2022,"Poland, Sweden refuse to play World Cup qualifier with Russia",Poland and Sweden will not play a Qatar 2022 playoff in March in Moscow after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.,".Poland will not play its football World Cup qualifier against Russia next month following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. .“In light of the escalation of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, the Polish national team is not going to play a match against Russian Republic,” the president of the Polish Football Association, Cezary Kulesza, said on Saturday. .It is the “only correct decision,” he said. .Moscow is scheduled to host Poland in the semi-finals of its strand of the World Cup playoffs on March 24 and, if its team advances, is scheduled to host either Sweden or the Czech Republic on March 29 in the Path B final. .Kulesza added the association was in talks with Swedish and Czech associations to present a common position to FIFA. .Polish national team players also took to social media to express their support for the move. .National team captain Robert Lewandowski said he couldn’t “imagine playing a match with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues”. .“Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can’t pretend that nothing is happening,” he wrote on Twitter. . .Kamil Glik, Mateusz Klich, Matty Cash and other players said it was not an easy decision but “there are more important things in life than football”. .They also expressed solidarity with Ukraine “and our friend from the national team, Tomasz Kedziora, who is still in Kyiv with his family”. .Sweden later on Saturday also announced it would not play the soccer World Cup qualifiers against Russia. .“The illegal and deeply unjust invasion of Ukraine currently makes all football exchanges with Russia impossible,” Swedish Football Association chairman Karl-Erik Nilsson said. .“We therefore urge FIFA to decide that the playoff matches in March in which Russia participates will be cancelled. But regardless of what FIFA chooses to do, we will not play against Russia in March.” .The conflict has entered a third day since Russian leader Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale invasion that has killed dozens of people, forced more than 100,000 to flee Ukraine in just 48 hours and sparked fears of a wider conflict in Europe. .FIFA president Gianni Infantino refused to take a decision regarding the playoffs when he held a press conference hours after the invasion began on Thursday. .He said “FIFA condemns the use of force” adding he was “shocked” by what he had seen but would not be rushed into a decision over moving the matches. .“The first match is in a month, we hope of course that this situation will be resolved well before then,” he said. .European football’s governing body UEFA punished Russia on Friday by stripping Saint Petersburg of hosting European club football’s showpiece event the Champions League final on May 28 and awarded it to Paris. .UEFA made no reference to its relationship with Gazprom, the Russian state energy giant that is one of their key sponsors, but is reportedly in talks to cut ties. .It also announced that Russian and Ukrainian clubs and national teams competing in international competitions must play home matches at neutral venues “until further notice”.",751

The SC, however, rejected those claims and termed them “ludicrous, defamatory, and absolutely false”. .“Misappropriation of state funds is a serious crime in Qatar, and this is reflected in the court’s decision,” said a Qatari official, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera following the appeal hearing on Wednesday. .“The case of Mr Ibhais followed all the proper legal procedures and protocols. Mr Ibhais was convicted following the careful examination of an abundance of strong and credible evidence against him for soliciting bribes to influence the outcome of a state-funded procurement process.” .Ziyad, Ibhais’s brother, told Al Jazeera that the family was “planning to appeal, although we have very little faith in the Qatari so-called legal system”. .Ibhais was not present in the court when the judge upheld the guilty verdict on Wednesday. .His family told Al Jazeera in a statement that Ibhais’s absence was “meant to deprive Abdullah from being seen with the effects of hunger strike apparent on his body … this is a part of the continuous attempts to silence Abdullah”. .In 2019, the SC launched the investigation after a complaint was received “from a third-party participant in a tender for the award of a contract related to the management of social media platforms on behalf of the SC”. .“The complaint was supported with audio and visual documentary evidence,” the SC statement added. .SC officials told Al Jazeera that following the investigation “a number of SC employees were issued with written warnings” while two, including Ibhais, were suspended. .Ibhais’s family claimed that neither any evidence nor the internal investigation was produced in court hearings, adding that his earlier requests to view documents and charges against him were repeatedly denied. .However, the SC said the evidence and documents were handed over to “relevant public authorities for further investigation” which also marked the stage where “SC’s involvement in the case ended”. .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of the 2022 World Cup. .While the Kafala system, which tied down a worker to a private sponsor, was abolished in a landmark ruling last year, workers in the country have still complained of facing problems, including false absconding cases and non-payment of salaries, while attempting to switch employers. .In August 2019, about 5,000 construction workers went on a strike citing unpaid salaries and poor working conditions, including workers who had previously worked on two World Cup stadiums. .While reporting on the strike, Al Jazeera spoke to protesting workers who said that in addition to poor living conditions, they had not been paid for up to four months, the companies had failed to renew their work permits – making their status in Qatar illegal – and were not given the required letters that would allow them to switch employers. .Leaked WhatsApp conversations on an SC “Crisis Comms” group, published by Norwegian website Josimar, showed discussions taking place among SC officials on how to handle media coverage of the strike. .The conversations, confirmed to Al Jazeera to be authentic by the SC, showed Ibhais showing apprehension following suggestions that SC denies any World Cup workers were involved in the strike. .In the group, Ibhais said he visited the workers along with a colleague and confirmed World Cup workers were also affected. .“We need to fix and then do the PR part,” he was seen saying in a separate conversation with Fatima al-Nuaimi, communications executive director at the SC. .In a voice note on the group, Hasan al-Thawadi, secretary-general at the SC, was heard telling the “comms and workers welfare” departments to “come up with a narrative to clarify and explain on how we address this situation, to clarify and explain we have taken steps beyond any other institution, any other organisations to ensure speedy payments for workers”, Josimar reported. .“That needs to be clarified, figure it out, if it’s a delay of a month, then put a narrative on it, put a spin on it,” he was heard saying. .Ibhais claims that the internal investigation launched weeks later was due to his stance on the strike and the affected workers. .His family told Al Jazeera that following the investigation, Ibhais was arrested from the office by state security, adding that he was denied legal assistance while in detention. .“When he asked for a lawyer, he was told ‘we will break the leg of any lawyer who enters this building’,” his family claimed. .However, a Qatari official said Ibhais “received legal advice and representation throughout the process in accordance with Qatar’s laws”. .Ziyad added that “faced with the prospect of not being able to see his family and threatened with force, Ibhais confessed to something he didn’t do”. .“He said he was trying to take bribe in return to awarding a tender but then changed his mind. The tender was not awarded in the end. He’s facing all this for a crime that did not take place.” .The SC has said Ibhais’s allegations following his conviction and sentencing that “the SC conspired against him because of his views on migrant workers are ludicrous, defamatory, and absolutely false”. .“The SC’s work culture promotes and encourages staff raising issues and grievances, and particularly on the subject in question (Workers’ welfare).” .In a joint statement released earlier this month, Fair Square and Human Rights Watch said that  “an analysis of a Qatari police report and witness statements show that the SC handed over highly sensitive and apparently unsubstantiated and vague allegations that Ibhais was engaged in activities aimed at ‘harming the state or its security’.” .The statement added that Ibhais told the two organisations in September that “interrogators used the subsequent initiation of a State Security investigation to coerce him into confessing to the lesser charge of bribery and misuse of state funds”. .“Increasingly it appears that Abdullah Ibhais is in jail because of suspicion and paranoia, not any evidence of wrongdoing,” Nick McGeehan, director of FairSquare, said in a statement.",758

762,Published On 12 Oct 2021,Iran’s women football fans snubbed in closed-door S Korea match,Iranian sport officials have contradicted each other on why spectators were banned during a crucial match in Tehran.,".Tehran, Iran – A draw between the national football teams of Iran and South Korea has meant that both countries are one step closer to securing a spot in next year’s World Cup tournament. .The 1-1 result in Tehran on Tuesday kept Iran top of its Qatar 2022 Asian qualification group with 10 points, followed closely by South Korea with eight points. .But what happened off the pitch before the match proved just as important as the result, if not more so, as no spectators were allowed in the capital’s iconic Azadi stadium. .The stands were empty despite that, for weeks, Iran’s football federation had said it wanted about 10,000 fully vaccinated people – including women – to cheer on the national team at the stadium that can hold about 80,000 fans. .Those fans would have been the first image of relative normalisation as the country has curbed a fifth wave of the deadliest COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East, which has killed more than 123,000 lives, according to official figures. .But even as vaccine imports and country-wide rollout have significantly accelerated in the past two months, more than 200 Iranians are still falling victim to the virus each day. .Moreover, under pressure from FIFA, football’s global governing body, Iranian authorities said they agreed that a number of women would also be allowed to watch the game in the stadium. .So when the football federation announced two days before the match that spectators would not be allowed in, it prompted a social media response from people who said the move may have been aimed at preventing women from entering the stadium. .The issue of allowing women into Iranian stadiums has for years been a point of contention and a constant source of disappointment for fans. .Women were banned from stadiums after the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution, something officials have said is to protect them from inappropriate behaviour by men. .But mounting pressure from FIFA and fans inside the country led to small victories for women in international matches. .In June 2018, a small number of women were allowed to enter the Azadi stadium – in separate seating arrangements from men – for the first time since the revolution to watch a crucial World Cup match between Iran and Spain, held in Russia, from monitors in the stadium. . .Several more limited opportunities were provided, the last of which was in October 2019, when about 3,500 women watched a match where Iran beat Cambodia. .Meanwhile, women continued to be banned from all Iranian league matches, which were regularly held across the country with tens of thousands of male spectators. .No football matches have been held with the presence of fans at stadiums for the past year due to the pandemic. .Speculations about the match with South Korea only grew when top sport officials contradicted each other about why spectators were barred from watching the match at the stadium. .On Monday, Hassan Kamranifar, the secretary general of the football federation, told reports that the decision was an internal one, and authorities felt that filling up the stadium at this point could lead to more COVID-19 infections and damage the country. .But then minutes later, sport minister Hamid Sajadi took to the podium during the same event in Tehran and told reports that the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has prohibited fans from cheering at the stadium. .“We had the necessary permits for 10,000 fans at the stadium and it would’ve been great for us because we wanted to send the message to the world that our vaccination efforts have been successful,” he said. .The AFC did not respond to a request for comment. .However, indoor cinemas across the country were allowed to air the match live on Tuesday. .Neither official commented on the presence of female spectators, or whether they would be granted access to stadiums in the future. .But Kamranifar told state television later on Tuesday that Iran’s league football matches – which are slated to begin in a week and do not allow female spectators – will soon make preparations to welcome fans. .He also said the football federation will work to host Iran’s future national team matches, which will start in about two months, “with conditions considered by FIFA”. .",762
763,Published On 21 Jun 2021,Qatar 2022: Norway rules out boycotting football world cup,Delegates at extraordinary congress called by the Norwegian Football Federation vote for motion rejecting boycott of the event.,".Norway’s football federation has ruled out boycotting the 2022 World Cup in Qatar despite pressure from its grassroots over accusations of human rights abuses of migrant workers in the Gulf state. .At an extraordinary congress called by the Norwegian Football Federation (NFF) on Sunday, 368 delegates voted for a motion rejecting a boycott while 121 were in favour. .In the run-up to the vote, Ole Kristian Sandvik, spokesman of the Norwegian Supporters Alliance (NSA), said the matches in Qatar will “unfortunately be like playing on a cemetery”, a term commonly used by opponents of Norway’s participation. .Norway has not qualified for a major international competition since Euro 2000 and is currently fourth in its World Cup qualifying group. .So although qualification seems an uphill task, the result of the vote could have had an impact on whether Norway continued to play qualifying matches. .The movement calling for a boycott began when the Tromso IL club spoke out in February. .“We can no longer sit and watch people die in the name of football,” the first division club said. .Tom Hogli, a footballer-turned-public-relations-officer for Tromso IL, told the AFP news agency: “There is no doubt that this World Cup should never have been awarded to Qatar. The conditions there are abominable and many have lost their lives.” .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of the tournament in 2010. .The country said it has carried out several labour reforms in the run-up to the mega event that takes place in November and December next year. .In August last year, Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for a “no-objection certificate” – an employer’s permission to change jobs. Earlier this year, a new minimum wage law was also introduced. .In a poll published by the VG newspaper last week, nearly half of Norwegians (49 percent) are in favour of a boycott, while only 29 percent are against. . .Feeling the pressure from grassroots campaigns, the NFF referred the matter to an extraordinary congress which on Sunday brought together its eight-member executive committee and representatives of 18 districts and hundreds of professional and amateur clubs. .Discussions revolved around the findings of an expert committee which, with the exception of two members representing fans, had already also come out against a boycott. .Rather than a boycott, the committee had recommended 26 measures to consolidate and further the gains made in Qatar. .Norway’s national squad has already protested conditions in Qatar but stopped short of calling for a boycott. .Before recent games, Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland, captain Martin Odegaard and their teammates wore t-shirts with slogans like “HUMAN RIGHTS On and off the pitch”. .FIFA argue that awarding the hosting of the World Cup to Qatar has opened the door to social progress. .“We know there is still work to be done, but we need to recognise the significant progress achieved in a very short time,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in May. .",763

765,Published On 28 Mar 2021,Why are football teams protesting against Qatar 2022 World Cup?,"Ahead of qualifiers, Norway, Germany and Netherlands footballers have protested Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers.",".Footballers are staging on-field protests in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers to highlight Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record that have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of next year’s tournament. .A media report published earlier this month alleged that 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since 2010 when the country was awarded hosting rights of the 2022 tournament. .Qatar responded by saying that “the mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population”. .There have also been protests against harsh working conditions, especially during the summer when temperature often goes past 40C (104F), wage abuse – including on a World Cup stadium site – and lack of rights afforded to migrant workers, who comprise about 95 percent of Qatar’s population. .Qatar’s government told Al Jazeera it has made several reforms over the years around working conditions and labour rights. .The Netherlands national team wore t-shirts emblazoned with the words “Football supports change”. .Norway players wore shirts stating “HUMAN RIGHTS” and “On and off the pitch”. .The German team lined up in black shirts, each with one white letter to spell out “HUMAN RIGHTS” but its football association said it was opposed to boycotting the World Cup. .On Sunday, Denmark players will “dare to make stand in favour of human rights”. .Last week, Amnesty International sent a letter to FIFA President Gianni Infantino, calling on world football’s governing body to use its leverage with the Qatari authorities to help end the abuse of migrant workers. .In August 2020, Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for an NOC – employer’s permission to change jobs – that rights activists said tied workers’ presence in the country to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .The announcement was the latest in a series of labour reforms carried out by the country in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup. .In response to the report earlier this month, Qatar’s World Cup organising committee said it has “always been transparent about the health and safety of workers”. .“Since construction [of stadiums] began in 2014, there have been three work-related fatalities and 35 non-work-related deaths,” a representative said. “The SC [organising committee] has investigated each case, learning lessons to avoid any repeat in the future.” .Earlier this month, Qatar’s Government Communication Office (GCO) told Al Jazeera the country “has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs… to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective”. .“We have improved health and safety standards for workers, strengthened the capacity of labour inspectors… increased the penalties for companies that violate the law,” a recent GCO statement said. .FIFA’s disciplinary code states players and federations can face disciplinary action in cases of “using a sports event for demonstrations of a non-sporting nature”. .However, the organisation said it will not be opening a case against the protests by Germany and Norway players. .“FIFA believes in the freedom of speech and in the power of football as a force for good,” a FIFA spokesperson said. .Last week, Infantino said Qatar has made social progress because of becoming the World Cup host. .England manager Gareth Southgate said the English Football Association and Amnesty have been in talks. .Germany midfielder Joshua Kimmich said the boycott calls have come “10 years too late”. .“It wasn’t allocated this year, but a couple of years ago. One should have thought about boycotting back then,” said Kimmich. .“Now we need to take the opportunity and use our publicity to raise awareness about things. But it’s not just down to us footballers … we should work together.” .Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said it would be a mistake for teams to boycott the World Cup in the wake of player protests.",765

The quartet severed diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting “terrorism” and of foreign interference. .Qatar has consistently denied the accusations, saying the embargo undermines its sovereignty. .In a country with a population of 2.75 million – 90 percent of whom are foreigners – Qatar has largely managed to weather the blockade. .Over the past few weeks, Qatar’s foreign minister has made a series of statements that hint at healing the rift between Riyadh and Doha, saying that early talks between the two sides had broken a “stalemate”. .“The celebrations today are a striving force for Qataris and expats to bond, and a narrative of unity [as opposed to] a wedge between people,” al-Naama said. .He criticised the blockade as “frivolous” and “child’s play” and said while relations with Saudi Arabia seem to be thawing, the UAE remains “belligerent and stubborn”.",780

Usually, it’s [hosted by] a big country with 10 different cities,” said Mike McGuinness, a football fan from the United States, who was in attendance for Saturday’s matches.  .“This is just one [major] city, so I don’t understand how they’re going to house all the people,” the 50-year-old, who was visiting Doha on holiday from San Francisco, told Al Jazeera. .But he said he will be back in three years’ time for his eighth World Cup.  .While drinking is not allowed inside stadiums, fans can have alcohol at different boutique hotels and the Fan Zone at Doha Sports Park, where the matches are being screened. .“The biggest issue is finding the balance between the Western fans looking for a certain culture of party and the local culture of Qatar,” Lisa Nassi, a 41-year-old Canadian and Doha resident, told Al Jazeera. .“That’s going to be their biggest challenge.” .Follow Saba Aziz on Twitter: @saba_aziz.",782

Being drunk in a public place is socially unacceptable. .In January, Qatar added a 100 percent alcohol tax that increased prices but then lowered them around 20 to 30 percent. .Although he did not see a high risk of hooliganism, al-Khater said having the fans of all 32 teams in a small area could lead to altercations, adding that Qatar was looking at “unique accommodation solutions” including cruise ships and fan villages in the desert. .Al-Khater also said homosexuals had nothing to fear in a country where homosexual acts are strictly prohibited, although the law is rarely enforced. .“Public displays of affection are frowned upon here but that applies to everyone,” he said. .“I would like to assure any fan of any gender orientation, religion or race to rest assured that Qatar is one of the safest countries in the world and that they will all be welcomed here.”",789
790,Published On 19 Sep 2019,Renewed calls for Qatar to address treatment of migrant workers,Doha vows to ‘comprehensively address’ labour issues after report says hundreds of workers returned home ‘penniless’.,".Doha, Qatar – There have been renewed calls for Qatar to address and review its treatment of migrant workers after a new Amnesty International report revealed that “hundreds of migrant workers” have been forced to give up on “justice” and return home “penniless” since March 2018. .Qatar and its labour laws have been under the spotlight ever since the country was named the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Its government has pledged to resolve labour disputes in the run-up to the tournament. .In the report published on Thursday, Amnesty said it followed the “search for justice of more than 2,000 people working for Hamton International, Hamad bin Khaled bin Hamad (HKH) and United Cleaning after the companies stopped paying their wages for several months, citing financial difficulties”. .The companies then ceased operations and ended the contracts, prompting at least 1,620 of these workers to submit complaints to the Committees for the Settlement of Labour Disputes. .“While some of them were eventually given part of what they were owed by their employers in exchange for dropping their cases, most went home with nothing,” said the report. .The committee received more than 6,000 complaints last year, according to the report which added that most of them had not been resolved at the end of the year. .“Despite the significant promises of reform which Qatar has made ahead of the 2022 World Cup, it remains a playground for unscrupulous employers,” said Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty International’s deputy director of global issues. .“Migrant workers often go to Qatar in the hope of giving their families a better life. Instead, many people return home penniless after spending months chasing their wages, with too little help from the systems that are supposed to protect them.” .In a statement to Al Jazeera in the wake of the Amnesty report, Qatar’s Government Communications Office said, “Qatar has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs, including the International Labour Organization, to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective.” .“Any issues or delays with our systems will be addressed comprehensively. We have said, from the outset, that this would take time, resources and commitment,” the statement said. .In August, there were calls for Qatar to completely “remove the power imbalance between employees and the employers” after at least 5,000 workers took to the streets to protest salary delays and working conditions. .Employees of Iskan and Tashgeel, working on construction projects throughout Qatar, staged peaceful strikes on August 4 and 5 near their accommodation camps in Shahaniya, just over 30km outside the capital, Doha. .Protesting workers, mostly from Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera that in addition to poor living conditions, they had not been paid for four months, the companies had failed to renew their work permits – making their status in Qatar illegal – and were not given the required letters that would allow them to switch employers. .Under Qatar’s “kafala” (Arabic word for sponsorship) system, migrant workers must obtain their employers’ permission – a no-objection certificate (NOC) – before changing jobs, a law that rights activists say ties them with their employers and fuels abuse and exploitation. .“We protested for six hours in order to demand our rights and salaries that amount to 1,200 Qatari riyals [$329] a month,” one of the Iskan workers, who was part of the protest, told Al Jazeera. .“We have to look after ourselves. The reason we came to Qatar was to earn money and support our families back home,” said another worker. “What’s the point of being here if we’re not getting that?” .The government said an investigation was launched following the protests and, in addition to authorised signatories of the two companies being arrested, the “outstanding salaries of all workers were paid in full”. .“The findings of the investigation confirmed that salaries had been delayed following a period of negative cash flow at both companies, caused by non-payments elsewhere in the supply chain,” a government statement said. .The Iskan workers interviewed by Al Jazeera confirmed the payment but said there were deductions and the company still owed them money. They said they were “glad that the government intervened and got us our dues” before adding that there were “pending issues that needed resolving”. .The workers said no officials from the company came to visit the camps following the protests. .Iskan and Tashgeel did not respond to requests for comment from Al Jazeera on the allegations. .Both the companies are also providing the workforce for the construction of the 2022 World Cup stadiums. Tournament organisers told Al Jazeera that 203 workers from the two companies “currently engaged on FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 projects were not part of the strike action taken”. .But it did not confirm whether those employees had unpaid dues. .“The Government of Qatar places the utmost importance on strengthening the rights of its guest workers and ensuring that all companies respect these rights and adhere to Qatar’s labour laws,” added the government statement issued last month. .In response to an earlier Amnesty International report warning that Qatar was “running out of time” to stamp out labour abuse, the gas-rich peninsula in the Gulf promised to treat labour reforms as “a journey and not an end in itself”. .Last year, Qatar announced it was abolishing the need for exit permits for non-domestic migrant workers. It also did away with the need for an NOC if the migrant worker completed the contract duration or finished five years in the event of an undefined time period in a contract. .However, rights groups have demanded wholesale reforms, including the abolishment of the kafala system. .“I don’t think Qatar has gotten far enough [with the labour reforms],” Hiba Zayadin, Gulf researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera. “What’s needed to really see improvements on the ground is the abolishment of the kafala system. .“The introduction of minor reforms is not able to tilt the power imbalance between the employee and the employer. This allows employers to have several tools at their disposal that they can use to keep workers in those conditions.” .In the Asian Town area of Qatar’s industrial area, a security officer told Al Jazeera his colleagues staged a small protest demanding their overtime payments which were held back for three months. .He said all his colleagues worked 12-hour shifts every day, amounting to 72 hours a week. Qatar’s labour laws stipulate a maximum 48 hours of work a week without overtime, reduced to 36 hours during the holy month of Ramadan. .“To ask for your right in this country is to have your ticket back home issued,” he said. “I was promised a higher salary in my country but was told to sign a different contract when I arrived in Qatar. I had taken a huge loan to pay the agent back home in order to get this job, so I had no choice but to sign it.” .Other migrant workers that Al Jazeera spoke to shared similar concerns, including salary delays, unlawful termination and stories of poor accommodation where “five to six people shared a room and there was no place to even walk”. .Qatar’s labour ministry has welcomed workers to lodge their complaints with it, but the majority finds it risky to take that course for fear of serious repercussions from their employers. .“There’s definitely a lack of faith in the system and in the available avenues,” Zayadin said. .“Which is why the government needs to address the NOC issue. Once you reduce the tools for an employer to retaliate, the workers will be less afraid of coming forward as their immigration status will not be connected to the employer they’re are complaining about.” .*No workers wanted their names published in the story. .",790

It will also host the 2019 World Athletics Championships in September and October. .Located in the southern city of Al Wakrah, this 40,000-seat stadium was inaugurated earlier this year. .The Lusail Stadium, located in Lusail City just outside the capital Doha, will host the opening ceremony, opening match and the final of the World Cup. .According to the SC, the concrete superstructure of the stadium and the seating terraces are at an advanced stage. .Al Bayt Stadium .The Al Bayt Stadium, located in Al Khor city, has a capacity of 60,000. Its exterior, which resembles tents used in Qatar’s deserts, is half complete. .Education City Stadium .Education City stadium, on the outskirts of Doha, is right in the middle of Qatar’s leading universities’ campus. .After hosting matches to the quarter-finals stage, the arena will be reduced in half and 20,000 seats will be donated to build stadiums in developing countries. .Al Rayyan Stadium .The Al Rayyan Stadium is being built on the site of the old Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium, previous home of Qatar’s Al Rayyan Sports Club. It will have a capacity of 40,000. .This 40,000 seat stadium is located 12km south of Doha’s skyline and seafront. It is an architectural depiction of the gahfiya, a traditional cap worn by Arab men. .The venue’s unique design won the Architectural Review Future Projects Award in May. .To be built on the shores of the Gulf, the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium will overlook the Doha skyline in the backdrop. .This 40,000-seat venue will be completely dismantled and re-purposed for other sporting and non-sporting projects after the tournament. Its foundations are currently being laid.",791

797,Published On 19 Jun 2019,No case opened against Platini in World Cup probe: French police,The former French football administrator has been questioned over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.,".Former UEFA president Michel Platini will not face formal legal proceedings in an ongoing French probe into the awarding of the FIFA World Cup to Qatar. .The 63-year-old was released from custody late on Tuesday after being questioned by anti-corruption police over possible offences including private corruption, conspiracy and influence peddling. .French authorities are investigating an alleged lunch meeting between the powerful football administrator, French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Qatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was crown prince at the time, ahead of the 2010 vote. .FIFA, the world governing body for football, has previously investigated the award of the World Cup to Qatar but did not find evidence of improper behaviour. .News agency AFP quoted Platini as saying he faced “a multitude of questions”, not only over the Qatar 2022 issue but also the 2018 tournament in Russia awarded on the same day in 2010, Euro 2016 in France and FIFA in general. .“It was very long, given the number of questions, it was obviously always going to be long, since they asked me questions over Euro 2016, the World Cup in Russia, the World Cup in Qatar, Paris Saint Germain, FIFA,” Platini told reporters as he left the police station outside Paris where he had been detained. .“I replied to all the questions calmly, while still not knowing why I was there,” he added. .Former French captain Platini, who voted for Qatar in 2010, has long denied any wrongdoing. His counsel William Bourdon insisted Platini had not been arrested but rather underwent “a hearing as a witness in the context desired by the investigators”. .Platini was suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in 2015 for receiving a “disloyal payment” of $2m from then-FIFA President Joseph Blatter. .Platini is one of France’s most famous sportsmen and football stars. He led France to victory in the 1984 European Championship and played in two World Cup semi-finals.",797
798,Published On 18 Jun 2019,Platini detained in Paris as part of Qatar 2022 World Cup probe,"Disgraced former European football star held over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, Le Monde reports.",".Former head of European football Michel Platini has been detained for questioning in Paris over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, Le Monde reported on Tuesday. .The French daily reported that prosecutors were particularly looking into a 2010 lunch hosted by France’s then-president, Nicolas Sarkozy, nine days before the announcement that Qatar would host the cup. .Platini, 63, and Qatar’s prime minister at the time, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, were guests at the lunch, according to the newspaper. .Platini was head of UEFA for eight years and voted for Qatar to host the tournament. .Two of Sarkozy’s aides at that time, Claude Gueant and Sophie Dion, were also questioned by police on Tuesday, judicial sources confirmed to Reuters news agency. .Dion remains detained, along with Platini, while Gueant has been released, the sources said. .French financial prosecutors have been investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and previously questioned former FIFA president Sepp Blatter. .France’s financial prosecutor services opened the investigation on grounds of private corruption, criminal association, influence peddling and benefitting from influence peddling relating to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar, respectively. .Platini’s lawyer and adviser did not immediately answer messages seeking comments. .Platini, who was banned from the game in 2015 for six years (later reduced to four years) over ethics violations, was being detained at the Anti-Corruption Office of the Judicial Police outside Paris, AP news agency reported. .Platini, a former attacking midfielder, was a top goalscorer for club and country in the 1980s. .He was admitted into the prestigious French Legion of Honour, before going on to manage France’s national team, organising the 1998 World Cup in France and eventually being appointed to lead the European game as president of UEFA. .But his legacy and reputation were destroyed four years ago after it emerged he had received a $2m payment from Blatter amid a corruption scandal that rocked world football. .“When FIFA originally awarded the World Cup to Russia and then to Qatar, it was done by a committee that was notorious for corruption,” said Lee Wellings, Al Jazeera’s sports correspondent. .“But the scandal around Michel Platini was centred on a payment he received a year after that decision was made, so it’s important to focus on the facts.”",798
799,Published On 3 Jun 2019,Qatar to host next two FIFA Club World Cups,"Doha says the competitions will serve as test events for the 2022 World Cup, which will be hosted by the Gulf state.",".The next two Club World Cups, in December this year and in 2020, will be played in Qatar as preparation for the 2022 World Cup, global football governing body FIFA has said. .The seven-team club tournament, which will include European champion Liverpool this year, will be played in December and in December 2020, FIFA confirmed on Monday. .“It is an amazing test competition for us. We will try to use the Club World Cup as a test in as many ways as possible,” Hassan al-Thawadi, chief of the local Qatari organising committee for 2022 said. .That includes coping with an influx of potentially thousands of fans who will want to drink alcohol, which is currently only available for foreigners in a limited number of bars in Qatar. .“Alcohol will be available in certain areas,” al-Thawadi said. “The details of it operationally, how it’s going to work out, all that stuff will be put in place and we will be announcing it in due course. .“We will have fan zones available so it will be a great opportunity for us to put in place some of the plans we have for the World Cup already to get lessons learned from it.” .The decision to give Qatar the Club World Cup comes two weeks after FIFA settled on 32 countries for the 2022 World Cup rather than expanding to 48 teams. .The Club World Cup has recently been held in Japan and the United Arab Emirates with seven competing teams – six continental champions and a team from the host nation. .After Qatar hosts the final two editions of the tournament in its present format, FIFA will revamp it to include 24 teams, a move that has been opposed by the European Club Association (ECA) which has issued a boycott threat. .Tunisian club Esperance de Tunis qualified last week as African champion, New Caledonian club Hienghene Sport will represent Oceania, and CONCACAF’s place was secured by Mexican club Monterrey. The Asian and South American teams will be determined in their continental finals in November. .The South American and European champions enter in the semifinals at the Club World Cup. .Liverpool, which beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Champions League final on Saturday, lost its only Club World Cup final in 2005 to Sao Paulo in Yokohama, Japan. .“It’s a great opportunity, the time of the year that we have it, to test out their facilities,” said Canadian FIFA Vice-President Victor Montagliani. “I think it will be good for Qatar to have the two events over the next years.”",799
800,Published On 23 May 2019,FIFA shelves plan to expand 2022 World Cup to 48 teams,"World football governing body scraps plans to expand tournament in Qatar from 32 teams, citing ‘logistical’ problems.",".Football’s global governing body FIFA has abandoned plans to expand the 2022 Qatar World Cup to 48 nations, deciding to stick with 32 countries because of the political and logistical complexities of using another Gulf nation. .FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s hopes of expanding the Middle East‘s first World Cup in the region were stymied by the regional diplomatic crisis and the body’s demands on host nations to adhere to its human and labour rights requirements. .That means the World Cup will not be expanded until 2026, with FIFA already having approved a format with 48 teams for that tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. .A meeting of the FIFA Council in March authorised Infantino to work with Qatar on seeing if it was feasible to use at least one more country in the region to accommodate 16 more matches and present a proposal at meetings in June. .“Following a thorough and comprehensive consultation process with the involvement of all the relevant stakeholders, it was concluded that under the current circumstances such a proposal could not be made now,” FIFA said in a statement on Wednesday. .“Due to the advanced stage of preparations and the need for a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact on the host country, more time would be required and a decision could not be taken before the deadline of June. It was, therefore, decided not to further pursue this option.” .A FIFA internal report had already concluded the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia could not join as cohosts unless they restore the economic and travel ties with Qatar that were severed two years ago. .The regional diplomatic crisis left neutral Kuwait – which acts as the mediator in the Gulf rift – and Oman as the viable options. .Oman has said it is not eager on hosting games at the FIFA showpiece. Infantino visited Kuwait last month in an attempt to persuade it to host matches in 2022. .But FIFA has now concluded it lacked to the time to prepare a country to host the extra games. .In Kuwait, Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium has 60,000 seats and the capacity at Sabah Al-Salem Stadium is only 26,000. Both venues would require upgrades to be used at the World Cup, putting the spotlight on working conditions and labour rights. .FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura wrote to human rights activists last month to offer assurances that there was going to be “an assessment of human rights risks and potential opportunities associated with a possible expansion”. .Qatar has an exemption that allows foreigners to drink alcohol, but Kuwait has a complete ban that would have been problematic for FIFA, which has the Budweiser brewery as a major sponsor. .FIFA has already had to adapt to cope with taking its showpiece tournament to the Middle East for the first time. .While Qatar won a vote in 2010 on the basis of staging a June-July World Cup, FIFA shifted the tournament from its usual slot because of the fierce summer heat to November 21-December 18, 2022. .“With just three and a half years to go until kick off, Qatar remains as committed as ever to ensuring the 32-team FIFA World Cup in 2022 is one of the best tournaments ever and one that makes the entire Arab world proud,” the 2022 World Cup organising committee said in a statement. .James Dorsey the author of The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer, said he was not surprised by FIFA’s decision on Wednesday. .“I think this was a foregone conclusion,” he told Al Jazeera from Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. “We’ve had weeks of basically discussing hot air and something that was, in my mind, delusionary – with other words, Qatar was willing to play this out. .“It certainly became clear after Kuwait and Oman said that they would not be able to accommodate FIFA in an expanded World Cup, and the idea that Infantino was putting forward that an agreement to share the World Cup with Saudi Arabia and the UAE would put an end to the Gulf crisis was basically pie in the sky.” .Dorsey said that if the boycott of Qatar continued until the World Cup in 2022, the four blockading countries – Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt – were going to have “a really difficult problem”. .“It’s a soccer-crazy part of the world; this is the first time that a major sporting event is being held in the Middle East, and in fact in their backyard,” he said. .“Fans are not allowed to travel to Qatar under the boycott, and even if they were allowed the logistics of getting to Qatar would be very difficult, given the cut in air traffic and the closure of the Saudi-Qatari border,” he added. .“So in the end, you could see the boycotting states being put into a position where they would have to breach their own boycott.”",800

802,Published On 29 Apr 2019,Uncertainty in Kuwait around expanding World Cup 2022,Kuwait’s football community weighs pros and cons of hosting 16 additional matches of an expanded FIFA World Cup.,".Kuwait City – For years, Kuwait’s football governing body battled to lift the third FIFA ban of its history, sparked in 2015 by government meddling in the running of the local football association. .Deprived of partaking in any international competition for more than 780 days, Kuwait’s national teams and clubs were left crumbling before the ban was finally lifted in late 2017. .But the damage was done. According to national team player Omar Al Hebaiter, the sanction caused several frustrated, talented players to quit professional football and the sport has struggled ever since. .However, a sense of hope now abounds in Kuwait following recent attempts to expand the 2022 World Cup. .“We might have the world’s most prestigious sporting event at home and raise very high the Kuwaiti flag,” Al Hebaiter said joyfully. .FIFA President Gianni Infantino held World Cup talks with Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on April 14 in a bid to expand the tournament to 48 teams from 32. .Sheikh Ahmad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah, president of the Kuwait Football Association, told Al Jazeera that “everybody hopes [for it to happen]… Infantino came two times, think about it”. .At Thamir Stadium, a recent match played for the Emir Cup entertained more than 300 heated supporters amid a sand storm pierced by violent lightning hitting the sky. .Yet, in the grandstands, Al-Arabi SC fans voiced scepticism over the prospect of co-hosting a World Cup. .“Our pitches are hideous, our stadiums date back to the 1960s, and alcohol consumption or Israel’s participation will never be accepted,” said supporter Sami Al Saad. .Indeed, by FIFA standards, Kuwait counts only two stadiums that could host international matches: the 60,000-seat Jaber Al Ahmad International Stadium and the 26,000-seat Sabah Al Salem Stadium, both of which require upgrades. .At the Kuwait Football Association (KFA), the matter of infrastructure is taken lightly. According to Al-Sabah, Kuwait has already set plans to refurbish stadiums in the coming years. .“When our emir says ‘OK’, he gives money,” asserted former national team manager Fahad Awadh, who retired after the FIFA ban. .However, Sylvia Schenk, member of the FIFA Human Rights Advisory Board, raised concerns over human rights as “time pressure is always adding to the risks”. .In this respect, FIFA will hold talks with rights groups in the coming weeks. .Beyond infrastructure, poor sporting performances stand out as a matter of concern. “Concede 10 goals per game is not my cup of tea,” lamented Sa’ad Al Houti, a legendary Kuwaiti football midfielder who played in the 1982 World Cup. .Awadh suggested that Qatar won the 2019 AFC Asian Cup as a result of “20 years of hard work”, which “Kuwait is yet to kick off”. Indeed, the national team is still ranked the 156th football team in the world, between Mauritius and Tahiti. .Following a decision to expand World Cups from 32 to 48 teams starting from 2026, FIFA studied the possibility of implementing it four years earlier. “Why shouldn’t we try,” questioned Infantino in January. .Forecast additional revenue of 16 additional matches is estimated at $400m. .Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the UK-based University of Salford, told Al Jazeera an extended contest gives Infantino “more to distribute to FIFA’s membership – those who, ultimately, elect FIFA presidents”. .Since having 48 teams in Qatar appears to be a difficult challenge, Kuwait could become the direct beneficiary of this unexpected turn of events. .Indeed, the country’s neutrality in a Saudi-led blockade imposed against Qatar by some of its neighbours since June 2017 privileges the state to co-host the tournament. Oman, the second GCC country that has remained neutral in the crisis, has expressed its unreadiness to host World Cup matches. .Neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates are unlikely to be nominated because of the economic blockade and sanctions they imposed on Qatar. .“We’ll see by June whether it is possible or not. [It’s] 50/50,” Infantino declared. .Chadwick said Infantino’s frequent visits to the region are a “show of intent rather than clear evidence that a deal is in the offing”. .In Qatar, such an unexpected probable change in planning has been met with dismay. Former Spain midfielder Xavi Hernandez, who plays for Qatar’s Al Sadd, claimed that a 48-team World Cup in Qatar ” will not be good”. .“It will be difficult to change now” as the Gulf country for years has prepared for 32 teams, he said. .The Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy – the Qatari entity responsible for overseeing infrastructure projects for the 2022 World Cup – told Al Jazeera it is open to discussing a potential expansion. .“It has always been our mission to ensure that this World Cup belongs to the entire Arab World,” a Supreme Committee spokesperson said. .In spite of the land, sea and air blockade, Qatar’s preparations to accommodate 32 teams have not slowed down and Lusail Stadium, the venue that will host the opening and final games, is about 90 percent complete. .Amid great uncertainty, many anxious observers await the final decision to be announced during the 69th FIFA Congress, scheduled for June 5 in Paris, France. .At the Kuwait Football Association, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Yousef Al-Sabah smiles slightly, excusing himself for not being allowed to comment. .“Qatar and FIFA’s president hold the decision. Let’s meet on June 5th,” he said.",802

He was elected to his first four-year term in 2015. .Sheikh Salman cemented his position by signing a new commercial rights deal in 2018, expanding tournaments and increasing the money going back to member federations. .Infantino told the AFC Congress that the no-contest was “important to show a united football family in Asia and to move forward in stability”. .Sheikh Salman was absent to attend his mother’s funeral. Infantino led delegates to observe a few minutes of silence to mourn with Sheikh Salman and show that “we are with him”. .Infantino, who defeated Sheikh Salman at the 2016 FIFA presidential election and is standing unopposed for another term in the FIFA polls in June, thanked the AFC for its support and stressed his commitment to expanding football in the region. .He said FIFA was stronger now under his watch, with higher revenue and reserves nearly tripled. .He said preparations for the 2022 World Cup were well ahead of schedule. FIFA and Qatar are still analysing the prospect of boosting the sport by adding another 16 teams, with the possibility of Qatar cohosting with neighbouring nations, he said. .“It will be a nice achievement if the first World Cup with 48 teams is played in Asia,” Infantino said. .FIFA decided in January 2017 that the World Cup will be 48 teams, but only starting in 2026 before the hosts were chosen. The United States, Canada and Mexico were chosen in a vote last year. .The push to increase the number of teams in 2022 is fraught with political and logistical impediments as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and non-Gulf state Egypt had cut political, trade, and transport ties with Qatar since mid-2017.

And while Amnesty acknowledged Qatar had undertaken a reform process, it added that work still needed to be done. .Qatar, a gas-rich peninsula in the Gulf, has said that it was committed to labour reforms, adding that “lasting changes” take time. .“Far from seeing time as running out, the Government of the State of Qatar understands further change is needed and we remain committed to developing these changes as quickly as possible, while ensuring they are effective and appropriate for our labour market conditions,” the statement further said. .“Practical, efficient and lasting change takes time and that is what we have committed to.” .The statement also added that the government “penalised or banned” almost 12,000 companies in the country for violating its labour laws. .Last year, Qatar amended its residency law to allow most migrant workers to leave the country without an exit visa, a move that was termed a “huge step” by the International Organization for Labour (ILO). .According to the head of the ILO Project Office in Qatar, Houtan Homayounpour, great progress has been made with regards to labour reforms in the country but the work is far from finished. .“There are remaining milestones to be achieved, such as the removal of the exit visa for domestic workers, a non-discriminatory permanent minimum wage, the removal of the NOC requirement, to name a few,” Homayounpour told Al Jazeera. .“These are in line with the agreed priorities with the government as a work plan for 2019.”  .Although the Amnesty report focuses on conditions of the nearly two million migrant workers in Qatar, not just the 30,000 on direct World Cup projects, Amnesty said FIFA had an “ongoing responsibility” to prevent abuse. .In response, football’s governing body welcomed Qatari labour reforms in recent months and its continued work with “stakeholders”. .In late 2017, a number of contractors working for Qatar 2022 launched an initiative to partially reimburse workers, assigned to some World Cup projects, recruitment fee they had been unlawfully charged in the country of origin. .Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary-general of the World Cup 2022 organising committee, said it was the organisation’s belief that “this World Cup can be a catalyst for change, both in Qatar and in other parts of the world”. .“Unethical recruitment is a global issue and an area many countries struggle to manage.

Khalifa International Stadium became the first tournament-ready venue in 2017, while two more stadiums will be completed early next year – Al Wakrah Stadium and Al Bayt Stadium – Al Khor City. .“It has now been eight years since we won the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup and we told the world to expect amazing. With this stunning design of our showpiece stadium, I am proud today to once again be delivering on that promise,” SC Secretary-General Hassan al-Thawadi, said, commenting on the design launch. .“The new stadium is a nod to our past and a symbol of an exciting future. On the very same land as the home of our nation’s founder, it sits at the heart of a brand new city,” al-Thawadi added. .At a later news conference, Al-Thawadi said the total cost of building the stadiums was about $7bn and that spectators for the 2022 World Cup would be between 1.2 to 1.7 million. .The executive stressed that a decision to expand the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams would be taken after a feasibility study is completed in March. .Asked about how the blockade affected Qatar’s preparations for the World Cup, Al-Thawaid said: “At first we did get a little bit affected, of course. It only took us two or three weeks during which we sought alternative plans and looked for new suppliers. It was in our advantage. We found new contractors and now we get more quality materials at competitive prices. The blockade, of course, isn’t a good thing by nature, but [our] work was not affected.” .After the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Lusail Stadium will be transformed into a community space, including schools, shops, cafes, sports facilities and health clinics, the SC said. To make way for these amenities, many of the stadium’s modular seats will be removed and donated to sporting projects around the world. .Beating bid rivals Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States, Qatar won the hosting rights in 2010, which put the Gulf state under increasing scrutiny over the treatment of migrant workers. .To date, there have been three work-related fatalities and nine non-work related deaths of workers engaged in the construction of Qatar’s World Cup stadiums, according to the tournament organisers. .But the United Nations International Labour Organization dismissed all complaints lodged against Qatar following a new draft bill that introduced a minimum wage and legal protection for the foreign workforce, approved by the government last year. .At least 26,000 people are directly involved in the construction of the proposed stadiums. .Contractors involved in the World Cup projects have agreed to reimburse more than $14.4m to the thousands of workers who had paid recruitment fees before moving to Qatar.",812

I don’t want to pre-conclude what will be out there, but as of today it’s a 32-team World Cup.”",813
814,Published On 31 Oct 2018,FIFA hints at expanding Qatar 2022 World Cup to wider Gulf region,"As blockade continues, FIFA head considers possible shared hosting rights in other Gulf countries and increasing teams.",".FIFA, football’s governing body, is considering expanding the Qatar 2022 World Cup from 32 teams to 48, with the possibility of Doha sharing the tournament with other countries in the Gulf region.  .FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday that the expansion, which is slated for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, could come early at the next event. .“We have decided as well to increase the number of teams participating in the World Cup final tournaments, from 32 to 48. This will happen in 2026. Will it happen already in 2022? We are looking into it. If it is possible, why not?”, said Infantino, speaking at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Congress in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. .Qatar beat bid rivals Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US in 2010 to claim the hosting rights, becoming the first Arab country to do so. .One of its stated aims was to create a legacy for the Middle East, but last year, its Gulf neighbours Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed political and economic ties with Qatar, imposing a land, sea and air embargo on the peninsula. .“We have to see if it is possible, if it is feasible,” said Infantino about the potential expansion in four year’s time. .“We are discussing with our Qatari friends, we are discussing with our many other friends in the region and we hope that this can happen,” he added. .“And, if not, we will have tried. We will have tried because we always have to try to do things in a better way.” .Infantino’s favoured plan of adding 16 extra teams – with 16 three-team groups – to football’s mega event was unanimously approved by the FIFA Council last year. .The 2026 tournament in North America is set to be the first World Cup hosted by three nations. .Preparations are under way in Qatar, which is breaking with tradition with a winter kick-off, as it looks to avoid the scorching summer heat. .Seven new state-of-the-art stadiums with advanced open-air cooling technology are being built for the 2022 event. . .The eighth one, Khalifa International Stadium, was inaugurated in May last year, after undergoing renovations and upgrades. .Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has said that Qatar 2022 is “very important for the whole region” and hopes that the football tournament will help the Arab nations “overcome difficulties”. .Earlier this year, South American countries had formally asked FIFA to make Qatar 2022 a 48-team event. .But Nasser al-Khater, assistant secretary-general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), which is overseeing the 2022 World Cup, said Qatar is still planning and working towards a 32-team tournament.  .“Technically speaking, everything is possible,” he told Al Jazeera. “It’s just that we need to understand the format, how it’s going to change, how many days would be increased for the 48-team World Cup and we take it from there.” .“We are going to keep an open-door policy as we have been,” al-Khater added. “We welcome everybody to come to Qatar and we still remain a Middle Eastern World Cup.” .Analysts have warned that the expansion of Qatar’s tournament would present a fresh batch of problems to a host nation that has already been the subject of much condemnation over migrant workers’ rights and its winter schedule.  .“How would Qatar – already working around the clock to cater for the needs of 32 nations, 64 games and the hundreds of thousands of fans eager to support their teams – allow for another 16 teams, not forgetting, of course the extra games and extra fans it would have to host in the allotted schedule?,” wrote Ross Griffin, assistant professor of Postcolonial Literature at Qatar University. .Al Jazeera’s sports correspondent Lee Wellings, reporting from London, said Infantino’s latest remarks are driven more by FIFA’s internal politics than anything else.  .“He [Infantino] is standing in Kuala Lumpur and talking to people who want to hear that there’s a chance for more teams in a tournament which is happening in their continent, so he knows he’s preaching to the converted,” he said.  .“What he also believes, somewhere at the back of his mind, is that he can actually make a political difference, rather like Sepp Blatter [ex-FIFA president] before him,” Wellings said. .“But when it comes to trying to sort out situations in the Middle East … to actually make this happen is way beyond Infantino and FIFA.” .",814

816,Published On 16 Jul 2018,"After Russia, focus shifts on Qatar for World Cup 2022","Organisers are confident Qatar, which has never taken part in a World Cup, will be able to deliver a successful event.",".Following a successful World Cup 2018 in Russia, and one of the most exciting finals in recent history, the focus has now shifted to Qatar which will become the first country in the Middle East to host football’s biggest tournament in 2022. .Qatar, with a population of just over 2.3 million, has never taken part in a World Cup and the temperature is so high during the customary mid-year window, the tournament has moved towards the end of the year. .On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin handed over the mantle of World Cup host to the emir of Qatar in a ceremony that marked a handover from the world’s largest country by landmass to one of the smallest. .“Russia is handing over the relay baton for hosting the FIFA World Cup to Qatar,” said Putin as he handed the official ball to FIFA President Gianni Infantino before it was passed onto Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.  .“I’m sure that our friends from Qatar will be able to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup on the same high level. We are, of course, ready to share the experience we acquired in holding the World Cup this year, along with our friends.” .The Qatari emir said his country would apply all its efforts to make the next event a success. .“We hope to overcome all the difficulties,” said the emir. “Although it will be hard to repeat that success [on the field] as we’re a small country, but we are very keen on sport.” .Qatar’s determination to make sure World Cup 2022 is a success comes in the middle of a land, sea and air blockade imposed on it by some of it its Gulf neighbours. .That initially prevented some construction material from getting into the country but organisers confirmed that all eight stadiums are on schedule, with several expected to be ready two years before the World Cup kicks off. .“It (the blockade) hasn’t affected construction on the site. There were materials originally sourced from the blockading countries. However, they are not the only sources of material in the world,” Tamim el-Abed, Lusail Stadium project manager, told Al Jazeera.  .“There are plenty of other alternatives and we quickly diverted our sourcing to other places in the world and other shipping routes and got things back on track instantly.” .As part of it’s winning bid in 2010, Qatar promised to take apart many of the stadiums at the end of the World Cup and send sections to developing countries to help them grow the game. .“We are ready based on the path we have set,” said Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary-general of the Qatar 2022 organising committee, in Moscow with a delegation of 180 officials shadowing their Russian counterparts in 11 cities. .FIFA confirmed that the tournament will be hosted from November 21 with the final taking place on December 18, Qatar’s national day.  .With additional reporting by Joanna Gasiorowska in Doha, Qatar. .",816

818,Published On 18 May 2018,Making Qatar 2022 a 48-team tournament is not a good idea,Expansion of the 2022 World Cup would bring more problems not only for Qatar but also FIFA.,".Recent reports in Western media suggest that the expansion of the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams could take place four years ahead of schedule to allow FIFA to reap the financial rewards of a larger tournament, estimated to be an added $1bn in revenue. .While a likely occurrence for the 2026 tournament, rumours continue to surface that Qatar 2022 could see the first iteration of this new, expanded format. If such expansion occurs, it presents a fresh batch of problems to a host nation that has already been the subject of much condemnation. .Qatar has largely addressed these criticisms, mainly by improving the situation of its migrant workers. The sudden spectre of being asked to host a 48-team tournament does throw a sizeable spanner in the works, however. Eight stadiums for a 32-team tournament is more than doable within the already abbreviated timeframe of a winter World Cup, given that all games will be played in and around the environs of Doha, not requiring much travel time for players and fans alike. .How would Qatar – already working around the clock to cater for the needs of 32 nations, 64 games and the hundreds of thousands of fans eager to support their teams – allow for another 16 teams, not forgetting, of course the extra games and extra fans it would have to host, in the allotted schedule? .For a start, before it ever began to think of where to accommodate spectators, it would need to re-up its minimum number of stadiums back to twelve to cater for the extra games. Such a task is an enormously difficult one, even for a nation with the financial muscle of Qatar. .One solution to this problem that has begun to appear with increasing regularity in Western media is to share the event with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is easy to see why such an option is logistically appealing to FIFA. . .It would immediately ease any potential concerns about stadiums being unfinished in the lead up to the tournament. Adding the domestic fan bases in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as those who could travel overland with greater ease from surrounding countries such as Jordan and Oman, the prospect of empty stadiums for less glamorous games is also offset. .Both nations have experience hosting FIFA tournaments, albeit on a much smaller scale. Saudi Arabia hosted the U20 World Cup in 1989 and the earliest iterations of the Confederations Cup through the 1990s, while the UAE has hosted the World Club Cup on several occasions over the past decade. .Given FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s recent visits to both countries, it would seem that FIFA may have already begun to explore the viability of this option of transforming their global showpiece into a 48-team affair in 2022 four years earlier than anticipated. The question remains, come June 13, will FIFA ask Qatar to share their World Cup? .Such a request would expectedly be met with a stout refusal from Qatar, even more so given that the embattled emirate has been the victim of a blockade led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE since June 2017. Putting such geopolitical complications aside for a moment, how would FIFA sell this idea to a Qatari nation that has already invested billions of dollars and weathered much criticism to ready their country for the world’s most-watched sporting event? .Allowing it to retain the opening ceremony, the final and other marquee matches, FIFA could argue that Qatar will remain the face of what will be the first Arab World Cup. It could point out that the inordinate millions that would have to be spent on four extra stadiums and added infrastructure could be reassigned to projects more conducive to Qatar achieving its 2030 National Vision. .Much more significantly, however, FIFA might suggest that a public willingness by Qatar to share its World Cup could lead towards a possible thaw in the chilly relations currently existing between Qatar and its Gulf neighbours. For a tournament to successfully take place, dialogue would have to begin, political bridges rebuilt, land borders reopened, and quite possibly, fractured relations between the estranged nations might be repaired. .The end-result would be that FIFA gets the World Cup it wants, with its reputation as the proprietor of a game that brings people together solidified even further. The very enticing surplus television revenues of a 48-team tournament would, of course, be a bonus. .Yet if such a dream were to become a reality, it would place FIFA in a rather unusual situation. While they directly forbid political interference in the sport, the thought of Infantino or any of his proxies actively encouraging Qatar to allow Saudi Arabia and the UAE a share of the tournament would appear to permit the reverse of this decree – the interference of sport in politics. .Surely it is within FIFA’s interest to keep both as far apart as possible rather than bringing them together, even if it means losing out on the honeypot of added television revenues until 2026? .Additionally, while an Arab World Cup would be Infantino’s presidential campaign promise to globalise the game come true, it could also bring with it some unforeseen problems FIFA has not yet considered. .Qatar has done some laudable work on addressing the concerns of the cultural West in preparation for their World Cup, so much that Sharan Burrows, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, has recently described the Gulf state as a role model to others in the region. .Would the UAE or Saudi Arabia be prepared to make such social changes? Recent reports about the abuse of migrant workers during the construction of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi or the continuing violations arising from the kafala (worker sponsorship) system in Saudi Arabia suggest otherwise. .Perhaps it is better for Infantino to let sleeping dogs lie on June 13 and leave Qatar’s World Cup as it is. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",818

Qatar has denied the allegations.  .Several blockading countries have launched well-funded media campaigns targeting Qatar.  .A French news website recently reported the FBI in the United States and Brazilian prosecutors were investigating an alleged transfer of $22m from the Gulf state to the former chairman of Brasil’s Football Federation, days after Qatar was awarded the tournament. .The investigation into alleged bribery of FIFA officials started in 2015 and is still ongoing. .“I am not aware of this investigation by the FBI. As far as we are concerned, the FIFA case is closed,” said Marri. .Speaking to Al Jazeera, Marri said he had a mandate from the Qatari leadership to fully cooperate with foreign investigators. .“Qatar is a state of law,” said the attorney-general. “On our side, we remain fully cooperative with international authorities who may wish to approach us to discuss these cases. However, we haven’t received any requests for cooperation so far.” .On November 27, the former president of Colombia’s soccer federation, Louis Bedoya,  testified in a court hearing in New York City that a sports marketing executive told him up to $15m in bribe money was available for South American officials from Qatar ahead of the FIFA executive committee vote for the 2022 World Cup. .Bedoya, also a former member of the FIFA executive committee, was testifying in the trial of three former South American football officials, with whom he said he discussed potential bribes during a conversation with an intermediary in Madrid in 2010. .In 2016, Bedoya pled guilty to corruption charges and was handed a lifetime ban from the FIFA Ethics Committee. .“We cannot pass a judgment [on Qatar] as court hearings in New York are still ongoing,” said Eduardo Vetere, vice president of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities based in Vienna. “We have to wait [for] the conclusion of the trials.”",819

The blockade has forced World Cup organisers to find alternative sources of materials to complete the eight venues that will host the tournament. .“We have come under criticism and attack over the years, but we have always faced our critics,”  Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Qatar World Cup supreme committee, told The Associated Press news agency on Friday. .READ MORE: Weary camels sent back to Qatar amid GCC rift .Thawadi maintained that logistical obstacles are being overcome and building work is continuing with only “minimal” cost increases. .“Our projects are going ahead as scheduled. This (blockade) is no risk in relation to the hosting of the World Cup.” .The diplomatic crisis stems from allegations Qatar supports “terrorist” groups in the region, charges denied by Doha. . .When Qatar’s sole land border with Saudi Arabia was closed and sea traffic cut off, World Cup organisers were forced to instigate their “Plan B.” They express confidence FIFA is not exploring a “Plan B” of its own for an alternate 2022 host. .“Every project has contingency plans, and we have had contingency plans in place from the very start,” Thawadi said in an interview during a visit to Britain’s capital, London, to attend an exhibition by the Doha-based Aspire sports academy. .“Once the blockade came into play we contacted the main contractors; we put in place alternative supply chains, we sourced alternative materials from alternate suppliers. I’m very happy to say that our project scale is on time and there is no significant impact on our projects. .“As of today, we haven’t seen a significant impact on the cost. There might have been some minimal increase in terms of establishing alternative supply chains, but these have been absorbed very, very quickly and been normalised as these supply chains have been put in place.” .READ MORE: Hassan al-Thawadi – World Cup a tool to fight terrorism .In an interview with Al Jazeera in August, Thawadi called the World Cup “the perfect tool to genuinely fight and stop the supply of terrorists” to armed groups. .“The World Cup is the quintessential opportunity, the quintessential platform for the region,” he told Talk To Al Jazeera, the Doha-based network’s flagship interview programme. .“The World Cup has the ability to be an economic engine, or at least contribute to an economic engine through a sports-integrated economy. It has the opportunity to support the skills development and … human capacity development for the youth of the region,” he said. .The fact that Qatar 2022 will be the first World Cup in the Middle East and the Arab World will allow the region “to showcase itself to the outside world; showcase our richness in culture, our richness in heritage, our sense of humour”, added Thawadi. .“A lot of people are actually not aware that we have a fantastic sense of humour  … In a time of divisiveness … we need every opportunity to celebrate our differences and promote our common humanity.”",825

They withhold salaries up to six months,” he said. .Still, Ashish is optimistic about one aspect of the new law. .“Even if it’s difficult to seek a no-objection letter from my employer, as long as the new company I’m applying to is ready to give me a visa, I can exit Doha and come back in five to 10 days,” he said. .Amnesty International said in a statement that the new law would “barely scratch the surface of an abusive system”. .The UK-based rights group called on Qatar to abolish exit permits altogether and ban passport confiscation, as leaving those mechanisms in place leaves workers “at serious risk of human rights abuses”.  .Amnesty International has been among the vocal critics of the country’s labour laws, calling for improvements that would specifically target working and living conditions of construction workers. .“We urge the international community not to draw any definitive conclusions until there has been time to see the new law in action,” minister Nuaimi said. .Qatar is building hotels, a port, a financial district and several football stadiums linked by desert highways as part of a $200bn construction boom funded by natural gas revenues that have declined since global oil prices fell in mid-2014. .A workforce of 2.1 million foreigners outnumbers Qatari citizens by about 10 to one.

Of course we will not just sit and wait. FIFA will step up its efforts in overseeing … in order to ensure the protection of the workers’ rights in the construction of the FIFA World Cup sites is fulfilled.” .Infantino’s trip came hours after Federico Addiechi, FIFA’s head of sustainability, admitted that Qatar’s human-rights record was not taken into consideration when it was awarded the tournament almost six years ago. .Addiechi made the comments at a discussion around a FIFA-sanctioned report on the organisation’s human-rights responsibilities at a UN forum on human rights in Doha earlier this week. .John Ruggie, a Harvard professor and the author of the report, made strong comments at the forum, saying FIFA was involved in human-rights abuses through its relationships. .READ MORE: Qatar World Cup 2022 fans could be housed in tents .He also warned Qatar that when the tournament comes around, the whole world will be watching “not only the games on the pitches but what it took to get there”. .Explaining one of his recommendations that urges FIFA to terminate its relationship with hosts that are not able to address human-rights risks, Ruggie told Al Jazeera that even in such a case “FIFA could not terminate the relationship easily, especially if it’s very close to the Cup”. .“In that case, it [FIFA] should explain what it has done to try to induce change and why it hasn’t succeeded,” Ruggie said. .“It’s not like flipping a switch and it is not meant to exclude countries by definition. It’s a judgment issue.” .In his report, Ruggie said: “FIFA should set explicit human rights requirements of local organising committees in bidding documents for tournaments and provide guidance on them” for bidding of tournaments in the future. .The Supreme Committee of Delivery and Legacy, the body responsible for Qatar’s 2022 World Cup and which works with the local organising committee, defended the accusations made in the Amnesty report and by other human rights organisations. .Speaking at the UN forum, Hassan al-Thawadi, Supreme Committee’s secretary-general, said the committee has cautioned companies working on World Cup sites that were accused of involvement in human rights abuses. .“Action has been taken against a number of these companies,” he said. .“We know our situation is not perfect. We know there are people living in horrid conditions and we are trying to fix that, but there are physical constraints in trying to resolve these issues.” .Thawadi said that the Supreme Committee had prioritised issues “in terms of severity and what can be resolved with least constraints” and admitted that the committee’s internal audit systems “had gaps”. .Addiechi said that by commissioning the Ruggie report and showing the intent to following it, FIFA has shown that its approach had changed. .“We will no longer say that anything in connection with the construction of World Cup stadiums is not our business,” he said. .Infantino, for his part, also insisted that the move of forming an independent committee was reflective of the organisation’s efforts to ensure better welfare for workers. .“We have to make sure that what we say will be delivered and that we have high-profile persons,” he said. .Follow Hafsa Adil on Twitter: @hafsa_adil",833

Last year the government made promises to improve migrant labour rights in Qatar, but in practice, there have been no significant advances in the protection of rights.” .The report rated Qatar’s response to nine migrant labour rights issue, saying only “limited progress” had been made in five items while the authorities have “failed to make any improvements” in the other four. .“The lack of a clear roadmap of targets…leaves serious doubts about Qatar’s commitment to tackling migrant labour abuse,” said Qadri. .“[FIFA] has yet to demonstrate any real commitment to ensuring Qatar 2022 is not built on a foundation of exploitation and abuse,” he added. .Qatar disagrees .But Qatar’s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs said in a statement that “significant changes have been made over the last year to improve the rights and conditions of expatriate workers”. .“The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MOLSA) appreciates the work and effort involved in this latest report on the State of Qatar by Amnesty International, but we disagree with a number of its claims,” the statement said. .“No one should be in any doubt that we are committed to effective and sustainable change.

Their presence in Qatar was no secret and they were engaged in a perfectly proper piece of journalism.” .The BBC also requested a full explanation and the return of the crew’s equipment. .The Qatar government has said it had invited the reporters to see some substandard accommodation as well as some of the newer labour villages, and had arranged interviews with the minister of labour and social welfare and other authorities. .“Perhaps anticipating that the government would not provide this sort of access, the BBC crew decided to do their own site visits and interviews in the days leading up to the planned tour. In doing so, they trespassed on private property, which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries,” the statement said. .“The journalists who took part in the press tour were given an opportunity for a comprehensive look at the problems Qatar is facing and the progress the government and the private sector are making to address those problems.  .“They saw some of the worst labour villages and some of the best. The BBC was meant to be part of that tour and would have been if they had not chosen to break Qatari laws.” .The Qatar government statement continued: “Once the BBC reporter and his crew were released from detention, we tried to help them get the basic elements for the story they had missed.” .“While the full programme could not be duplicated, a separate one-on-one interview with the minister of labour and social welfare was arranged and they were able to tour a modern labour village. .“By trespassing on private property and running afoul of Qatari laws, the BBC reporter made himself the story.

The next stage will be to have talks … in particular related to the international match calendar.” .FIFA’s executive committee prefers a 28-day tournament, four days fewer than usual and starting on November 21, but did not make a decision in the opening session of its two-day meeting. .The November through to December option had been expected after being recommended by a FIFA-appointed task force which met last month in Doha, the Qatari capital. .The task force sought to take FIFA’s lucrative event out of the Qatari summer heat in the June to July period when World Cups are traditionally played. .FIFA President Sepp Blatter then said he preferred a Sunday, December 18, final. Every World Cup final since 1966 has been played on a Sunday. .By rejecting UEFA’s preferred December 23 final, a Friday, the FIFA executive committee helped protect the English Premier League’s traditional December 26 program. .A 28-day World Cup would cut the time clubs must release players to national teams. .Both FIFA and Qatar have fought off  questions of corruption  ever since they were awarded the tournament back in 2010, with Qatar accusing its critics of a  clear bias against the Gulf monarchy.",849
850,Published On 28 Feb 2015,European clubs should just accept a winter World Cup,The world of football does not revolve around European clubs and its time they realise that.,".So there is a limit to the power of the English Premier League. .Indisputably the most entertaining, popular and money-spinning football league in the world, the world does not, it seems, revolve around it. .Fresh from a remarkable UK television deal worth $8bn, the EPL has been told it must fit in with the Qatar 2022 World Cup in November and December. At the Taskforce meeting in Doha, their voice, for once, seemed no more important than any other league or nation. .And maybe that’s just how it should be. .Let’s be clear on the EPL and churlish criticisms of it. Football changed, probably irrevocably, with the famous (infamous?) television deal at the start of 1990s that effectively married Sky and the sport. .We all tactically choose to forget this changed football for good as well as bad. I still love the thought of a 3pm Saturday kick-off, and am near emotional watching re-runs of matches from the late 1970s and 80s on muddy pictures with childhood heroes. .A league, afterall .We all know football is trying to be a business but failing usually. The EPL is one of the undeniable business successes of Britain. Transcending sport and always managing to maintain the upper hand. .It has taken everyone involved a long way, particularly estate agents in the posh areas around Liverpool, Manchester and Surrey. .But their power does have a limit. The EPL ultimately comes under FIFA’s umbrella. And it is A football association, not THE football association. It is not a separate entity, not the NFL or the WWE. It is a league.
A powerful, thrilling, entertaining and rich league but just a league. .I am not a Premier League basher. Quite the opposite, in fact. The Manchester derby in 2015 is not what it was in 1989 that I loved. But the 1980s version was different from 1920. .That’s life. Things change. I wish the peerless, wonderful Brian Moore was still alive and commentating on a match that cost five pounds that the working classes could afford. But a lot has happened since then and only part of it has been bad. .Europe should adjust .And so I believe Richard Scudamore has every right to stand in Doha and question the football calendar. Why should he do anything other than stick up for his league, and yes that happens to involve the traditions of English football. .But the EPL should accept something that should be blatantly obvious to all: Europe may have a loud and important voice, but it is not the only voice. .A gap in the English season is inconvenient to its main league. So what? They can play games between Christmas and the New Year and extend the season into the summer of 2023. Big deal. .It is so easy to lash out at Qatar, but on this issue its critics still refuse to play fair. .Why did FIFA not have, in its statutes, the right to play a World Cup outside of June and July in the first place? I have put this face to face to FIFA’s Sepp Blatter and General Secretary Jerome Valcke, suggesting current rules are misguided and discriminate against countries with high temperatures. .They have politely accepted it is a good question but they don’t have an answer. .The Qatar Supreme Committee bid for a World Cup that was slated for summer but that was not a crime. It should be moved to winter from the start. It’s still seven years away, enough time for the whinging one-eyed .British hacks (most of whom are male) to buy some sun screen for the ‘brutal’ temperatures in the low 20s. .This morning I was subjected to a couple of minutes of UK radio ‘debate’ about 2022. Apparently “Australia should have been awarded the World Cup because it needs to be taken to new territories”. .What? And what is exactly Qatar in World Cup terms? Maybe they hosted it once when I wasn’t looking? .But please don’t misunderstand my point. I’d love to see a World Cup in Australia at some stage. It’s just that, I accept that a World Cup in the Middle East is an important thing, the right thing. This is not just about Qatar. It’s an important point made repeatedly by 2022 Supreme Committee Chief Executive Hassan al-Thawadi. .Nobody needs to apologise it is not in a time and place to suit Europe and the EPL (where many clubs are financially backed in the Middle East). And no-one should. .From corruption allegations to the treatment of migrant workers, important questions have been raised over the last few years. But the issue of winter needs to be treated separately as a slow progression towards a sensible solution. .Winter of discontent?

I mean they have seven years to reorganise football around the world for this World Cup,” said Valcke when asked if any payment would be made following the shift from the originally proposed dates of a European summer tournament. .“It’s not perfect, we know that. But why are we talking about compensation? It’s happening once, we’re not destroying football. .“Why should we apologise to the clubs? We have had an agreement with the clubs that they are part of the beneficiaries. It was $40m in 2010 and $70m in 2014.” .On Tuesday, European Clubs’ Association chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said Europe’s clubs would seek financial compensation, but Valcke ruled that out following a meeting of a FIFA task force in the Qatari capital. .The proposed new dates for the event are set to be ratified by FIFA’s executive committee next month. .Valke also said the duration of the 2022 tournament is set be cut from 32 to 28 days, meaning more games will be played per day, so a country of Qatar’s size might need fewer stadiums.",851

855,Published On 10 Nov 2014,Groundhog Day for Qatar 2022,The discussions are never-ending and no conclusion has been reached as to when the 2022 will be played.,".One day at the Fifa HQ in Zurich, I expect to see the familiar world-weary face of actor Bill Murray at the entrance, crouched on the steps peering into the flowers looking for a groundhog. .There have been more ‘Groundhog Days’ than I’d care to remember around Qatar 2022. Or 2023, who knows.
At the meeting to discuss 2022 dates, all parties disagreed. They fought their corner. And yet their wishes are reported in some quarters as if revelatory or enlightening or even surprising. .Is there really any chance the World Cup could be played in the summer? No. It was always a red herring, always stupid and misguided. As I said to FIFA General Secretary Jerome Valcke earlier this year, “why did Fifa not consider dates could be moved to accommodate a hot host country before the bidding process started? Or should hot countries be precluded from bidding, because that’s a new one to me”. .And yet we constantly check in on D’Hooghe, the FIFA medical chief, as if he is ever going to say something new. His view is well documented: June-July is a no-no. .Proposing the dates .Does Fifa want the World Cup in November-December 2022? Yes? Is there a possible calendar that would work. Yes. Do some confederations prefer January-February? Yes. But that’s not going to happen unless they shift it to 2023 (Uefa are reportedly open-minded on 2023 and it does have positives). .But IOC won’t budge over 2022. Why would they and why should they? .It’s all a game. Will FIFA really take the IOC on and fall out when they don’t need to? The day FIFA starts disrespecting sponsors and broadcasting contracts (even the IOC’s) is the day they cease to respect the money that comes in to both organisations. Why would they take on such a potentially damaging battle? They have enough problems to contents with. .Do the European Clubs Association want April-May? Yes, but that’s surely the mother of all non-starters. European Cup finals in June? What nonsense. It rips the heart out of the very European season finale the clubs should want to protect. .And it’s Ramadan in the month of April 2022. As if a World Cup would be played in Qatar during that period. Is it ignorance or sheer bullishness by the ECA to suggest it might be. To me this is close to being the most staggering of all the hot air being produced around the exhausting topic of 2022. .Winter it should be .The only ‘development’ is the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee saying winter is the Middle East’s preference. After years of saying they will bend to whatever Fifa wants they surely have the right to express a preference. Though they then clarified they are ready any time of year. And recognising that the ‘international community’ are leaning towards winter is hardly a u-turn I saw it headlined as that in a reputable football magazine. .Of course if should be played in winter. As I’ve said in this column before, the world doesn’t revolve around Europe.
And remember this official meeting only came after 11th-hour calls from Executive Committee Members to actually spend time consulting. .When I headed to cover the ExCo meeting last October, I had been quietly informed deals were pretty much done, and that there would be a switch to winter. It’s as if the process is going backwards. .And now, more than seven years before the tournament, whatever they eventually settle on, there’s a sudden scramble to come up with a date. .Never mind the Garcia report, and Eckert, and sponsors leaving Fifa. Never mind the latest alarming Chuck Blazer revelations involving the FBI. Never mind the public’s irritation over the whole kerfuffle. Let’s all make our demands on which date suits us best. .Fifa’s decision .I am grateful to Keir Radnedge – KeirRadnedge.com – for reminding me what former Fifa official Mr Blazer himself said about why they decided to simultaneously award two World Cups, 2018 and 2022. Arguably the most damaging mistake in sports administration history. .“It was a good idea at the time [in late 2007]. We were facing a variety of things – economic uncertainty and the further uncertainty of how successful we might be with the World Cup in South Africa. Given the concerns we had, being able to market two World Cups right away on the strength of where we were plus, frankly, our thoughts were probably that there would be two big markets. .“No-one considered then that Qatar would be a winner or even, for that matter, that they would be bidding.” .They did bid. And they won. And guess what got ‘Lost in Translation’. It’s extremely hot in summer and the tournament would realistically need to be switched to winter however flexible the Supreme Committee were being. .Fifa’s failure to not recognise the heat issue, to deal with it, to manage the dates disruption decisively. It’s what has brought us to this messy point. .Groundhog Day all over again. .Fifa may wish they could call Murray’s Ghostbusters. Those ghosts of the infamous 2010 bid process, and the instigation of the process three years earlier, are still haunting them, and the football world.",855

FIFA president Sepp Blatter has said the tournament cannot be played then. .“In our opinion, this proposal is the best option. It takes into account the climate issue while preserving the traditional running of a club football season,” said ECA president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in a statement. .“The impact on national team fixtures and UEFA Club Competitions remains limited and the proposal has no impact at all on the Winter Olympics or the confederations’ tournaments in 2023.

FIFA agreed in principle earlier this year that matches could not be played in the searing heat of the Gulf summer. .Meanwhile, ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: “The first thing we must recognise is that FIFA’s decision was based on holding the World Cup in the summer of 2022. .“If there is now a strong wish for the stakeholders, FIFA, UEFA, FIFPro, and so on, to want to change, we are ready to discuss under one condition – that there is no damage for club football, because if we change from summer to November or January then it will affect our business, our calendar. .“And we are not ready to pay such a bill. That cost cannot be paid for by the clubs. We are not ready to pay it and it has to be made clear to FIFA that they need the goodwill of the clubs or we are not ready to talk or discuss it.”",857

The agenda doesn’t even reflect the big issue, as so often in the past. Not so much an ‘elephant in the room’ as the entire Zurich zoo (located next door) at Fifa HQ – the world cup bidding corruption report. .If Fifa wants to somehow, finally, restore its reputation and shift the spotlight to some of the good work and good people at the organisation, this is the time to bury the ghosts. Not next year, not in 2018 or 2022 but now. .Can the world governing body not really see what the public thinks of the delivery of this corruption report?

For those seeking the truth, it is like being kept on hold then passed around a call centre. .Garcia’s desire .Everyone is playing by the rules but why are these rules in place? .Michael Garcia’s role was of an investigator. A thankless task when so many of the corrupt figures from the Executive Committee resigned before properly facing the music. .Garcia, to his credit, wants the report made public. But his powers ceased when he handed it to the FIFA Ethics Committee, specifically Judge Eckert. .No one is questioning his right to take his time pouring over thousands of details before coming to his conclusions. But this is where things start to get unsatisfactory for those demanding transparency. .A simple question: does Eckert have the power to act against bidding nations? Or more pertinently, hosting nations. Could he change the outcome? .“That is not our job,” Eckert said when explaining his powers, or supposed lack of, at FIFA HQ. “We will not make any recommendations.” .Questions asked of FIFA .You don’t need a long memory to recall this same Ethics Committee handing out a succession of lifetime bans, with the notorious 2011 presidential election at the core of the corruption. .But this was about individuals. With individuals, the Ethics Committee does have powers. How convenient for Fifa, some might conclude, that its independent Committee can’t tackle bid committees. .And if Eckert cannot act, who can? This will end up back at the FIFA Executive Committee… spring of 2015 at the earliest. .Now does FIFA seriously consider this acceptable? Is it acceptable to them even? .But the question of reputation is a subtle one. They have a ‘problem with communications’ that needs addressing urgently. .Is this my accusation? Absolutely the contrary. There are smart, clever, likeable, underrated people quietly working wonders in their communications department. . .This is the verdict delivered by Fifa’s VP Jeffrey Webb and Michel D’Hooghe at the Soccerex event in Manchester earlier this month. .This is not about people or a department. This is about transparency of an organisation and confusing messages coming from the top. .No one can stop Blatter holding an Ethics Conference at FIFA HQ, which is rather like Manchester United and Van Gaal holding a seminar on defensive excellence in September. And no one can stop him saying Fifa is transparent. .But Mr Blatter, please, we beg of you, if you are reading this, do not treat the public like idiots. .I’ve defended you on-air when imperfect English mangled a message. That’s not a crime but don’t even try the transparency claim. The only transparent thing at Fifa is the glass in the lifts. .If it suits you politically, for 2018 and 2022 controversy rumble on indefinitely, consider the reputation all damage each passing day. .This, sir, is your big opportunity.
