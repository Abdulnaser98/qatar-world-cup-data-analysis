1,1,2 February,Qatargate: Two MEPs lose immunity in corruption case," .Two MEPs have had their legal immunity lifted by European lawmakers, following a request by Belgian authorities investigating a corruption scandal that has rocked the European Parliament. .Italian Andrea Cozzolino and Belgian Marc Tarabella deny wrongdoing. .The Qatargate affair unfolded when a Greek lawmaker and three other suspects were arrested on suspicion of corruption and money-laundering. .One of the suspects then agreed to ""tell all"" as part of a plea deal. .Pier Antonio Panzeri is alleged to have led a network that took bribes from Qatar and Morocco in return for influencing the European Parliament. Some €1.5m (£1.3m) was recovered in cash in a series of raids in Brussels and Italy. .Qatar has denied allegations that it sought to gain influence over MEPs while Morocco has hit back at ""judicial harassment"" and ""media attacks"". .However, prosecutors have said Mr Panzeri has admitted ""criminal responsibility"". .Mr Tarabella's home was raided last month when Belgian police detained the four suspects. Prosecutors then asked the parliament to lift his immunity from prosecution as well as Mr Cozzolino's. Both men were members of the parliament's centre-left Socialists and Democrats grouping. .The votes happened with little ceremony in a matter of seconds when lawmakers began a session of the European Parliament on Thursday morning. MEPs simply raised their hands as the details were read out. .Marc Tarabella attended the vote himself, making his way through a scrum of reporters as he headed into the chamber. Afterwards he told me he had voted to waive his immunity in order to ""be able to respond to the investigators' questions and help authorities shed light on this affair"". .According to the parliament report on Mr Tarabella, he is suspected by investigators of backing ""certain positions within the European Parliament in favour of a third country in return for cash payments"" for two years. Testimony against him suggests several payments totalling €120,00-€140,000, the report adds. .""Of course I deny any wrong,"" he told the BBC. Asked if had ever taken money to influence proceedings in the European Parliament he said: ""Never in my life!"" .The parliament's report on his Italian colleague cites investigators alleging participation in a criminal organisation and money laundering. Mr Cozzolino's lawyers said last month that he was innocent and that he had carried out political activity in a ""free and transparent way, having nothing to do with the crimes being investigated"". .He resigned last month as head of the parliament's delegation that works with the Maghreb nations, including Morocco. .Last month prosecutors said Mr Panzeri, who is an Italian ex-MEP, had agreed to provide details about how the scandal worked and who was involved in return for a shorter sentence of a year in jail. He ran an NGO called Fight Impunity in Brussels. .His wife and daughter were freed from house arrest last week as part of the plea deal. .Three other suspects remain in jail on suspicion of corruption and money laundering: .Parliamentary immunity means MEPs cannot be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings because of opinions expressed or votes cast in their capacity as an MEP. But it can be waived, if requested by a national authority. .Italian held in EU bribery probe agrees to tell all",1

5,5,2 January,"More MEPs could lose immunity in corruption probe, president says"," .The EU says it will launch proceedings to remove parliamentary immunity from two MEPs implicated in an ongoing corruption scandal. .Parliamentary President Roberta Metsola said she had taken the move after a request from Belgian police. .But her statement did not name the MEPs involved. .The scandal erupted last month after one MEP and three others were arrested on charges of corruption and money-laundering. .While authorities have not named the country behind the bribery network, numerous EU sources have accused Qatar of running the operation. .But the Gulf state has strenuously denied any claims of misconduct as unfair and ""gravely misinformed"". .Ms Metsola - who has previously said the scandal showed that ""open, free, democratic societies are under attack"" - said she would now launch an ""urgent procedure"" to remove parliamentary immunity from the two MEPs following the police request. .An EU source told the BBC that officers had made contact with her office on 30 December. .The request must now be filed before the entire EU parliament on 16 January, before advancing to the body's legal affairs committee. A report on the allegations will then be prepared, before a vote in the full chamber on removing the MEPs' immunity. .Ms Metsola said she wanted the entire process completed by 13 February. .All MEPs hold some limited immunity which means they can carry out their jobs, express their opinions and vote freely without living in fear of arrest or political persecution. .But the chamber can vote to strip them of that immunity after confidential proceedings. The process allows accused MEPs to present evidence and defend themselves. .European Parliament spokeswoman Yasmina Yakimova said last week that the purpose of immunity was to ensure ""that parliament can function"" but emphasised that it was ""not something that allows them to break the law more easily"". .One of the chamber's vice-presidents, Greek MEP Eva Kaili, was among those arrested during last month's raids. .However, the 44-year-old Socialist MEP - who has denied any wrongdoing - has already been stripped of her immunity as she was caught ""red-handed"", with reports suggesting police found her with large ""bags of cash"". .Her lawyer has denied allegations that she had accepted bribes amid reports that €150,000 had been found in her Brussels flat. .Sources said another €600,000 had been found at the home of one suspect, and another €750,000 in a suitcase in a Brussels hotel room. .She remains in pre-trial detention, along with her partner, Francesco Giorgi, Italian former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri and NGO head Niccolò Figà-Talamanca. .At a hearing last month, it emerged that Belgium's VSSE state security service had been working on an investigation into the corruption allegations for more than a year, with the aid of other EU countries. .Four in EU-Qatar bribery inquiry to stay in custody .MEP denies Qatar bribery after €1.5m seized .EU corruption row puts 'democracy under attack'",5

I just don't like it when everyone is drunk."" .Bete Basica has travelled from Sao Paulo to Qatar to support Brazil at the World Cup. She's come to Souq Waqif - the central marketplace in Doha - to buy some souvenirs before she heads home. .A huge football fan, Ms Basica writes about the game and has recently taken a football management course. She has travelled on her own for the tournament, and fondly remembers the ""magical"" time in her home country during the 2014 World Cup it hosted. .Speaking to the BBC, Ms Basica says the experience is very different in Qatar. .""Sometimes I'm the only woman in the metro,"" she says. ""I get many 'looks' - but that's it. .""You read many things about [the region], that it's very dangerous for women. But I feel respected by everyone and I had no problem being here on my own."" .The decision to hold a World Cup in Qatar has been controversial, with critics pointing to the country's human rights record and treatment of migrant workers used to build an entire tournament infrastructure. .Female workers spoke to the Guardianexternal-link about the harassment they have experienced in the hospitality industry, and a Qatari woman who lives in the UK told the BBC about the impact of religious conservatism on her mental health. .The marketplace of Souq Waqif has become World Cup fan-central. While it has always been the buzzing part of normally quiet Doha, the vibe is different now. For one, it's much more crowded; the supporters and flags of the teams playing on any given day have tended to take over. .The restaurants are busy and the smell of shisha (hookah) mixes with that of chargrilled meat. But one thing you won't find here is alcohol. Its sale is strictly limited and controlled here in Qatar - a conservative, Muslim country. .Just two days before the opening ceremony, it was announced that alcohol would not be sold to fans inside the stadiums, though there are specific areas in fan zones where you can drink. .Argentina fan Karen Retamal says, despite the limited access, she and her friends have been able to get a drink every day since they've been here - but she does prefer the dry stadiums, especially for her group. .""We're from Argentina. We live football,"" she laughs. ""And when we lose, I do prefer that there's no alcohol."" .Ms Retamal remembers how frustrated and angry fans were when Argentina lost to Saudi Arabia in their opening group match. .""When the game finished, they [Saudi fans] kept coming to us and saying: 'Where is Messi? Where is Messi?' We were really sad and angry,"" she said. .Ms Retamal believes that had those emotions been exacerbated by alcohol, the situation could have been very tense. .However, she says she has generally felt at ease moving around between venues during the tournament. .It is a contrast to how the showpiece match of the last major men's football event played out. .The Euro 2020 final was held at Wembley, and the disorder outside the stadium was broadcast around the world. Fans who experienced it told the BBC how unsafe they felt, and a review described it as a ""national day of shame"" for England. .In an attempt to avoid clashes between fans and local law enforcement, a number of British police officers were deployed to Qatar to act as ""cultural interpreters"" between fans and law enforcement, while Turkey and Pakistan also provided their own security. .From the start, this has been billed as a family-friendly tournament. That is evident at matches; parents with children of all ages can be seen with flags in their hands, with some in tears if their team loses. Many have said the lack of alcohol in the stadiums has contributed to the child-friendly atmosphere. .Jolanta Bhandu is Polish and has watched her team's games with her husband Hamlesh and two children, Ben and Maya. .""We prefer the lack of alcohol, especially when we go to the stadium with the children,"" she says. Most of the time, her team's crowd is the minority, ""so we'd prefer to have sober people at the stadium"", she laughs. .Francesca Ramsey, from Malta, has travelled with her husband. .""We love sports events,"" says Ms Ramsey, who also went to the 2014 tournament in Brazil. .""It's very different. Here, I feel the need to cover up more, but I don't have a problem with that. I respect the culture."" .Ms Ramsey seems a bit disappointed by the limited access to alcohol here. .""I like to have a glass of white wine - possibly two or three,"" she laughs, before adding that you do see better behaviour in the stadiums. .""We're used to a drink. I would've liked a glass of wine at the stadium. It's a time when you want to shout, scream and have a drink."" .The last-minute alcohol ban raised questions about the decision-making of football's world governing body Fifa, and its sway - or lack of - over the host country. .But for the local population, it was seen as the country's leadership staying true to Muslim rules and norms that the vast majority of people in Qatar abide by - and the ban may have made the World Cup more accessible for many locals, who probably would have opted out otherwise. .Despite the crowds, some fans have chosen to stay away, with the decision to stage the World Cup in a country where homosexuality is illegal heavily criticised. A transgender Qatari woman told BBC News about the fear she lives in, while Amnesty has said women in Qatar face discrimination in law and practice,external-link with them needing a guardian's permission for ""key life decisions"". .One of the most noticeable things here has been the number of local women, especially young ones, in the stadiums - be it Qatari women or residents who have lived here most of their lives. .Salma Ahmed says one of the reasons she and her relatives have felt comfortable to go is the fact there is no alcohol. .""I wasn't thinking about going to the stadiums before - but after the ban, I actually wanted to go,"" she says. .""I'm a huge fan of football, so it's been a great experience."" .Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-link .Get your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC Sounds",9

Many of those watching said they believed that their side's run at the World Cup in Qatar was just the beginning of a promising future for Morocco's footballers. .At the oldest cafe in Casablanca, fans became increasingly frustrated as their team struggled to score. .One supporter who grew up in France but was born in Morocco said he wanted the country to win because it was ""time for Africa to lift the World Cup"". .Moroccan fans were also watching the game in a large tent erected in the grounds of Madrid's Casa Arabe cultural centre. Traditional Moroccan snacks were handed around as fans cheered their team on. .""Despite everything, I am proud of our team,"" Inas, an English teacher from Rif, who wore a Moroccan national team shirt, told the BBC. .""They represented more than football, they gave us a symbolic victory in so many ways, the international attention and respect they gave us."" .Munir, a petrol station attendant originally from Casablanca, was chanting with a group of friends throughout the game and although he was upset when France's second goal went in, he was still upbeat. .""This is a once in a lifetime event,"" he said, of the Moroccan team reaching the semi-finals.

11,11,14 December 2022,World Cup 2022: 'Finally football smiles back at Arabs'," .The roars of ecstatic fans, car horns ringing out and buildings draped in red and green. .The atmosphere in Doha after Morocco's historic win against Portugal in the World Cup quarter-finals was enchanting. .""Finally football smiles back at Arabs,"" one Morocco supporter told the BBC. .The match's atmosphere gave some clues as to the reception the team will get when they face France in the semi-final on Wednesday night. .Whenever a Moroccan player touched the ball, the whole crowd cheered ""Sir!"" which means ""Go on!"" in Arabic. And they did. .On 10 December Morocco became the first Arab and African country to make it to the World Cup semi-finals, and I was there to witness it. .I never thought I'd get to attend a World Cup - let alone one held in an Arab country. .Growing up in the Middle East, the tournament always felt out of reach and too expensive. But it has always meant a lot to me. .Every four years, I watched the games surrounded by family either in my hometown of Aleppo in Syria where I spent most of my summers, or in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where I grew up. .Cafes would be draped in the flags of different countries, and brawls would erupt between groups supporting countries they had probably never even visited. .We were thousands of miles away from the action but the atmosphere was always memorable. .When I had the opportunity to cover this historic event, I could not hold back my excitement. .I'm no stranger to the Gulf region. I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. My parents moved there from Syria in the early 1980s due to political unrest and in search of better economic opportunities. .We often used to visit my uncle and cousins in Qatar for holidays in the 1990s. And although I was just a child, I distinctly remember the Sheraton Hotel building, with its pyramid shape, being the main landmark on Doha's Corniche. .Today, the Sheraton is dwarfed by a sea of high-rise buildings. Even though my last visit to Doha was in 2016, I still find myself unable to recognise many parts of it. .In just a few years, the country has built seven stadiums, a new 'city' on the outskirts of Doha, and rolled out a new metro system. .The atmosphere has been welcoming in Doha. Scores of international visitors have learned how to say a few simple Arabic phrases. Fans from Croatia to Argentina wore traditional Qatari male clothing, done up in the colours of their national teams. .But for me, it's the huge presence of Arab supporters that has made it special. .""To be an Arab and get a chance to witness the first tournament in an Arab country, it's an honour,"" one Saudi football fan told me. .Three Arab countries qualified for the tournament this year - Morocco, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. Their fans rushed to Doha to cheer them on. .Even an 86-year old Tunisian woman made her way here. ""I'm an old woman, but I did not want to be sitting at home during the World Cup,"" she told a Qatari TV channel. .On my first trip to Souq Waqif - the traditional-style market in the heart of Doha - I saw a parade of Arab football fans flood its alleyways and courtyards. .Before I knew it, I was chanting with the Tunisian and Moroccan supporters. .It's one thing to get here, it's another to win games. Arab hearts are used to being broken but this time it's been very different. .Morocco has made history. Saudi Arabia achieved one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history by beating Argentina, and Tunisia won against reigning champions France before going home. .""Football is the only thing that has given us this much hope and happiness,"" a delighted fan told me on Saturday night, as the celebrations continued late into the night in Souq Waqif. .But this tournament has been overshadowed by controversy, especially focused on Qatar's contentious records on migrant workers rights. .The country has made reforms and recently admitted that up to 500 workers died in total projects linked to the World Cup. However, human rights groups say this is far below the true figure. .There's a long-standing debate about whether sports should be mixed with politics. The World Cup has been hosted by controversial countries like Russia, which was scrutinised for it's human rights record and stance on LGBT+ issues.

There is no reliable information,"" Ms Nfati said. ""I came here with my brother and I don't know what we'll do… I'm heartbroken."" .The clash is the first time an African side have reached this stage of football's biggest competition, though their French rivals are heavily tipped by pundits to advance to the final against Argentina. .But Morocco coach Walid Regragui - who grew up in Paris - says his side are confident, and don't want to ""wait another 40 years for an African team"" to shine on the world stage. .The moment Morocco made World Cup history",13

19,19,9 December 2022,The seven-day-a-week life of a maid for Qatar's royal and rich," .Qatar's human rights record is under scrutiny as the World Cup takes place in Doha. A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed. .I make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed. .In a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children. .She eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago. .""Madam is crazy,"" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. ""She shouts at me every day."" .Before Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states. .Under scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers. .For example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent. .But Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says. .There is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under £350) and is able to send it all home to support her family. .Joanna Concepcion of Migrante International, a grassroots organisation supporting Filipino overseas workers, says that many keep quiet about bad working conditions because earning money for their families is their overriding priority. .But when those in Gulf states do feel confident enough to talk freely, she says, they often mention serious abuse. One woman said her employer would push her head into a toilet basin and deny her food and water when he was angry. .By contrast, a maid employed by the ruling royal Al Thani family, says she is treated well - but she has no day off, as all workers now should under the new rules. .Smiley and animated, Althea (not her real name) video calls the BBC from the basement of a royal residence. She explains that her employers have given her an iPhone, clothes, jewellery and shoes of a kind she couldn't afford back home in the Philippines. .As in Gladys's case, it's the difficulty of earning a living wage at home that has brought her here. .As we speak, other Filipino domestic workers, who share a large room in Althea's living quarters, say Hi and join the call. .They have their own bedrooms and a shared kitchen. This is important. The maids Althea sees on TikTok and Facebook begging for food, and pleading for someone to rescue them, are not as fortunate. .""I see those videos online all the time, which is why I feel so lucky,"" she says. ""For me, every day feels like a fairy tale."" .Nonetheless, it's hard work in these ""Cinderella palaces"" as she refers to them, with their high ceilings and chandeliers, antiques inlaid with gold, mother-of-pearl table tops, and freshly cut flowers. .The day generally begins at 6.30am, when staff prepare breakfast for the family. Althea eats once the family has finished. After clearing away, they clean the rooms and set places for lunch. .""It is light work because there are many of us,"" Althea says. .Maids rest in their flats between 3pm and 6pm, then prepare for dinner. Once dinner is over, Althea has finished work, and is free to leave the compound if she wants. .The royal family doesn't hold on to her passport. But Althea does work every day, including weekends. She doesn't get the day off that Qatari law is now supposed to guarantee. It's a price she pays for providing her family with vital financial support. .Mary Grace Morales, a recruiter in Manila who pairs Filipino staff with VIPs in the Gulf, says working for the palace is an ""enviable"" job. .""The family is generous,"" she says. And, in a comment reflecting the hardships the maids may have faced at home, she adds: ""The girls get fatter while they are in the palace. The family feeds them well."" .But the royals have some very specific requirements, she reveals. .""The girls sent to work for the Qatari royal family are between 24 and 35 and very pretty,"" Ms Morales says. .She pauses to look at the screen where I stare back at her from the BBC headquarters in London. .""Prettier than you,"" she says, smiling. .She later sends a WhatsApp to apologise, as her children overheard and said she had been rude. I assure her I was not offended - and don't mention that hiring people on the basis of their looks would be illegal in many countries. .Joanna Concepcion, of Migrante International, says she hopes Althea's account of working as a royal maid is true, but adds: ""It's unlikely that we can know that for certain while she is still in Qatar and working for such a powerful family."" .Some royal staff have complained after leaving the country. In 2019 three British and American workers - a bodyguard, personal trainer and private tutor - sued the emir's sister, Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and her husband, in New York, alleging that they had been made to work long hours without overtime. The couple denied the allegations and settled without any admission of liability. .""Reporting and addressing cases of violence and harassment, lack of occupational safety and health, and lack of decent accommodation can be challenging,"" says International Labour Organization (ILO) regional director for Arab states, Ruba Jaradat. .The ILO says it is working with Qatar to implement the new rules guaranteeing a minimum wage, a day off each week, sick leave and overtime payments, although this remains ""a challenge"". .Althea, in her royal palace, says she is happy despite the long hours. .When she goes to bed she will message one of her siblings or parents in the Philippines. She often feels homesick - a fairytale palace is not home. .However, it remains a crucial source of income. .""I could never support my family without this job,"" she says. .The BBC asked the Qatari royal family and the Qatari embassy in London to comment, but received no reply. .Illustrations by Marta Klawe Rzeczy .How does Qatar treat foreign workers? .'I am very afraid', says Qatari transgender woman .Families seek answers over Qatar building deaths",19

Al Khater said. ""I mean, death is a natural part of life, whether it's at work, whether it's in your sleep. .""Of course, a worker died. Our condolences go to his family. However, I mean it is strange that this is something you want to focus on as your first question."" .He added: ""Look, workers' deaths has been a big subject during the World Cup. Everything that has been said and everything that has been reflected about workers' deaths has been absolutely false. .""This theme, this negativity around the World Cup has been something that we've been faced with. .""We're a bit disappointed that the journalists have been exacerbating this false narrative. And honestly, I think a lot of the journalists have to ask themselves and reflect on why they've been trying to bang on about the subject for so long."" .Ella Knight, Amnesty International migrants' labour rights researcher, said: ""Unfortunately, Mr Al Khater is mistaken when he says that every fatality is investigated. This is simply not true. .""We and others have been calling on the Qatari authorities to conduct such investigations on workers' deaths for years to no avail. .""Instead, they continue to simply write off vast numbers of deaths as being due to 'natural causes' despite the clear health risks associated with working in extreme temperatures. .""It goes without saying that the Government should be investigating this most recent tragic case, as well as the deaths of all others.

""We have welcomed people from all backgrounds and cultures to celebrate the best of football here. .""Seeing how much people are enjoying themselves is the intangible legacy of the World Cup. As a Qatari woman who loves her football, working on this project for the past 10 years, then delivering it, is something that has been beyond my wildest dreams."" .Qatar is a conservative country but Sharia law is firmly entrenched in its constitution - homosexuality is illegal, and the consumption of alcohol is prohibited in public. .Surrounded by visitors from around the world, Qataris have stuck to their traditions and beliefs - men, women and children are seen at matches in their thobes and abayas (long robes) but with face paint and carrying scarves and flags. .Every stadium has designated prayer rooms, including the media centres, which are often packed when the time is approaching for the next of the five daily prayers, and the Khalifa International Stadium has a purpose-built mosque within its perimeter. .During England's first training session in Doha, the Maghrib (sunset) Adhan could be heard; at one Brazil game at Stadium 974, the imam was seen wearing a Neymar shirt; and during the last group game at Al Janoub, a group used a Uruguay flag as a prayer mat. .""If the World Cup hadn't been held here, we probably wouldn't have come [to Qatar],"" says Faizal, who has travelled from Yorkshire with his father and brother. .""The prayer facilities here make it very easy for us, whether it's in the fan festival, the souq or the stadium. It has been lovely to see tourists from all over the world attending the mosques and having a genuine interest in Islam and the Arab culture. .""Halal food is a must for us and would most likely be a struggle in other countries, so having access to halal food wherever we are is such a huge benefit to us."" .Three of the stadiums have also been equipped with sensory rooms,external-link giving fans with access requirements the opportunity to experience the game away from large crowds and loud music. .Qatar has spent billions on infrastructure for the tournament, including the stadiums, multi-lane motorways and a brand new metro system. .Organisers have consistently claimed three migrant workers died on stadium sites, with 37 further fatalities of stadium workers off-site due to non-work reasons, and disputed a report alleging as many as 6,500 migrant workers have died. .Late last month, World Cup chief Hassan Al Thawadi told TalkTV an estimated 400-500 migrant workers died ""as a result of work connected to the World Cup"". .However, Qatari officials quickly sought to clarify that figure, saying it was an estimate for fatalities across all industry sectors, not just infrastructure sites linked to the tournament. .With the most remote of the stadiums just 40 miles from the centre of Doha, there were questions before the World Cup about how the infrastructure would cope. .After an initial issue with the Fifa ticketing app on day two - causing issues for hundreds of fans going to the England and Wales games - stadium access has largely gone well. .With some of the stadiums a walk of 20 minutes or so from a metro station, hundreds of staff have been on hand to point people towards the venues, then shout ""metro, this way"" while pointing with giant foam fingers after the matches. .England fan Ben lives in Doha, and attended the first game at Al Bayt - the stadium furthest outside the city. .""The logistics around the stadium were very smooth,"" he said. ""There were loads of buses getting us to the ground from the metro and loads of buses to get us back. .""Getting into the ground was smooth, too. The queue was long but it moved steadily and we were inside in about 20 minutes. .""But no food or water was available in the concourse near us, which was a bit of a farce."" .Holly, an England fan who travelled for the group stage, said: ""What has really surprised is the ease to get to the stadiums and around the city. The metro has been brilliant and you hardly have to wait."" .Another England supporter said fans could get to most stadiums quite easily, but the ones further away were ""quite difficult to navigate"". .The longer-term legacy of the tournament will be felt once foreign fans have returned home, though, and a Brazilian man who has lived in Qatar for eight years told us the construction of the metro system will have a particular impact. .Qatar has a low crime rate, so being pickpocketed or mugged in the street is unlikely. But security has been heavily bumped up for the tournament, with plenty of police officers patrolling the metro and stadiums. .Japan supporter Take said he felt ""much safer here"" than in Brazil eight years ago. .""You had to check your bags everywhere you went,"" he said as he reflected on his experience in 2014. ""Here, nothing."" .England fan Mike said: ""This is a World Cup like no other - it is so different, but it has been brilliant. I went to the fan festival and there were so many fans around enjoying the occasion. .""Obviously you don't have the drinking, and there hasn't been any trouble. It all feels so safe."" .Another England fan, Holly, added: ""There were concerns about coming, but I have really enjoyed it. It is a very different atmosphere to what we are used to at football in England. .""There being no drink and no large groups of fans has made it a bit of a carnival atmosphere. I haven't seen lots of European fans about, but the South Americans have more than made up for that."" .In the build-up to the tournament, it was unclear how many supporters would travel to Qatar and what the atmosphere was going to be like at matches. .It is estimated more than one million fans have made the journey, and very few matches have looked significantly undersubscribed. Indeed, Fifa said attendance for the group stage had been an average of 96% of stadium capacity.external-link .The majority of games have been full of the colour, passion and noise you would expect at any major tournament, though there have been others that have prompted people to post on social media they have felt ""flat"" or ""artificial"". .The most obvious difference when compared with previous tournaments has been a reduction in the number of European fans. While the likes of Brazil and Argentina look to be represented everywhere you go, it is unusual to see a supporter wearing a European football shirt away from the stadiums. .A Germany fan we met before their draw with Spain said the atmosphere at European games had been ""disappointing"" and there was a huge contrast to the 2006 tournament in his homeland, where fan parks had ""100,000 in every day... here it is only 30,000 at the Corniche"". .Many supporters have been impressed by the atmosphere in the stadiums, though, with Brazil fan Dulce - who has lived in Doha for five years - saying it was ""as good as ever"". .""We have really loved it,"" she said. ""I am told there are about 30,000 Brazil fans who have come from South America, and 38,000 from Argentina. This is usual. .""Just listen to the noise. You could be anywhere in the world and this noise is as loud and as good. I am excited by what will happen later in the World Cup."" .While we have been speaking to supporters who have chosen to travel to Qatar, there are, of course, many fans who have stayed away, with the decision to stage the World Cup in a country where homosexuality is illegal heavily criticised. .Organisers have always maintained all visitors would be welcome regardless of race, religion, gender or sexuality, but they also said they expected their laws and culture to be respected, and many LGBTQ+ fans said they had not received the assurances over safety they needed. .Days before the World Cup kicked off in Qatar, a fan group said football is ""leaving behind"" its LGBT supporters. .A gay fan wrote in a diary for BBC News that, although he has never felt concerned for his safety in Qatar, locals ""don't consider gay fans as part of the equation"". .A transgender Qatari woman also told BBC News: ""I am very afraid, but I just want people to know that we do exist."" .BBC News journalist Shaimaa Khalil wrote from Doha: ""It does feel like there are two parallel universes when it comes to the controversies around this World Cup. .""For the advocates, the activists, the European teams and especially the seven captains who had intended to wear the One Love armband, this is an LGBT and human rights issue they want to remain vocal about. .""For hosts Qatar, and those spectators who've come here or who are watching around the Arab world - which has a vast Muslim majority - this is about religion, culture, the norms of the region and mostly about respect which they don't feel they're getting."" .Alcohol cannot be consumed in public in Qatar, while ordinarily it is only available to purchase at certain hotels or if you have a licence. .Just two days before the start of the tournament, Fifa changed its policy and decided that alcohol would not be sold at the eight stadiums. .The tournament has been mainly trouble-free, apart from an incident which appeared to show a fight between Argentina and Mexico supporters. .In Msheireb - the downtown area of Doha where there are a number of restaurants with al fresco dining - we spoke to a fan with a Scotland shirt on and his two friends enjoying a soft drink. .Asked how he has felt without alcohol being easily accessible, he said: ""It hasn't been a problem at all. In fact, it's made us feel a bit better."" .An Ecuador fan, who now lives in Saudi Arabia, said they drink alcohol in his home country and it is a ""big way of life"". He admitted it had been ""very hard for a few weeks"" after he moved to adjust to not drinking alcohol and having parties, but he is used to how it is in Qatar and now has an alternative. .""Here, coffee is like our beer,"" he said. ""People are lining up for ages for coffee."" .Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-link .Get your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC Sounds",25

27,27,6 December 2022,World Cup: Ipswich Town fan on his Lowestoft 'flag wars' in Qatar," .A fan whose flag was draped behind a goal in England's win over Senegal has described how he had to fend off an ""army of people"" to secure the slot. .Bob Green, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said friendly ""flag wars"" between fans was a feature of a pre-match build-up. .He has taken the flag, featuring his hometown and Ipswich Town's badge, to each England World Cup game in Qatar. .It has attracted local interest but he said he often had ""to explain where Lowestoft is and show them on a map"". .The flag was visible to TV audiences around the world when Bukayo Saka scored in the 57th minute of England's 3-0 victory on Sunday night. .His flag also features the England three lions badge and the names of two pubs in Lowestoft - The Flying Dutchman and The Blues Bar. .The Ipswich Town season ticket holder said he wanted to get both venues a bit of international exposure. .""It's tough times for pubs and just wanted to do my little bit to help,"" he said. .""There is a lot of interest in the games locally [in Qatar]; they've really embraced it and whenever it is hanging up people ask about all the branding and want to have their picture taken with it."" .A former RAF serviceman, Mr Green explained how getting his flag into good, visible locations had been like a military operation. .""You have to be the first person in the stadium to get a good spot and once you get in, you can't get out,"" he said. .""[On Sunday] I got in about 18:10 and kick off was 22:00. .""There's a whole army of other people trying to get their flags in a good spot as well so it's like flag wars to get a prime position. .""We ask the press photographers behind the goals to get pictures of our flags for us, so we at least get a decent shot of them. .""It's all good fun."" .Mr Green said he would stay in Qatar for as long as England remained in the tournament and, as a member of the England travel club, he had conditional tickets for the quarter final, semi-final and final. .He said that everybody out there had been ""good as gold"" and the whole tournament was ""really, really well run"". .""When you walk into a stadium, it's like walking into a hotel and there are helpers absolutely everywhere,"" he said. .""I came out with a lot of reservations... but from the apprehension of going, it's been absolutely brilliant."" .England face France in the quarter-final on Saturday. .Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Amid controversy over the selection of host country Qatar, what has the experience been like for England supporters at the tournament? .England's clash with the Africa Cup of Nations champions will be Ian Odgers 19th game at this World Cup. .He said: ""I think it's been a fantastic experience, the country have been more than welcoming. .""It's a unique World Cup in that everybody has been based in Doha so all the fans are mixing."" .He said with the metro system and the shuttle buses, organisers were ""making the whole experience really easy"" and the size of the country has allowed him to see so many games. .The 54-year-old from Dereham in Norfolk said: ""In Russia I travelled 15 hours on a train at the World Cup just for one game. .""Here the longest time you are ever on a coach is 65 minutes and it can be as little as 15 minutes to a stadium and between stadiums."" .But it has not all be straightforward, as his England flag, with Dereham Town on the bottom and ""England till I die"" through the middle, has caused problems. .He said: ""I had one issue within a shopping mall, that was with the 'till I die'. They were quite concerned as to why I would put that slogan on my flag. .""The other issue is the 'Dereham town', they don't understand what it is."" .He has to have the flag checked by security staff at stadiums before he enters. .Mr Odgers said: ""To start with it was a little frustrating but now it's almost become the norm, it's expected, it comes out at the stadiums, they take a photo, they send it off, it gets approved. .""Now I've been to so many grounds, I have been recognised by one of the security guards and he just jokes 'I know that one's OK because I remember you'."" .Peter Humphrey, 66, and his partner Allison Curtis, 54, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, headed over to the World Cup after a ""quirk of fate"". .Ms Curtis' daughter had been due to get married in Sicily during the pandemic. .After they were forced to rearrange the wedding, Ms Curtis switched the tickets to Qatar for the couple to tick a World Cup off their bucket list. .Ipswich Town fan Mr Humphrey said the whole experience had been ""absolutely brilliant"". .He said any apprehensions he felt before going were allayed as soon as he saw Doha and felt the ""incredible atmosphere"" of the city. .""We went the day before England's first game [against Iran] and didn't quite know what to expect,"" he said. .""It was so well-managed, it was an incredible atmosphere with different nationalities and everyone having a different story to tell.

I spoke to some Qatari people who felt they'd had an unfair media representation but they are selling their country."" .Ryan Shaw, 28, from Chesham, in Buckinghamshire, moved to Qatar in August and has been to every England game so far. .The teacher said for the most part fans have been able to focus on and enjoy the sport without being impacted by debate about the host nation. .""It's been a really good atmosphere. You can go to the fan zones or to a bar before the game for a drink and there's a lot of different nationalities mixing."" .He said compared to the Euro 2020 matches in London last year, he thinks there are fewer issues as people head home from matches because people have sobered up. .As for any controversies, he said fans were focusing on football and making the most of the experience of being at a World Cup. .""I disagree with a lot of the stuff but it's also nice to go and see matches in the city I'm living in and enjoy football,"" he says. .""Once the match has started you can forget about it and just watch the game. .""The fan experience hasn't been overshadowed, being here it's fun."" .Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

29,29,4 December 2022,Cutting energy prices will take years - power boss," .It ""will take years"" to get energy prices back to pre-Ukraine war levels, the boss of one of the world's biggest energy firms has told the BBC. .Enel's Francesco Starace said bringing prices down depends on new sources of energy such as renewables and heat pumps. .Governments across Europe are spending billions helping business and households afford energy bills. .They are also scrambling to secure new supplies. .Mr Starace said the company, which produces and distributes electricity and gas, tried to shield its 20 million European customers from energy market volatility this year. .It did its best to stick to the fixed-price contracts it had agreed, he said. .Breaking customer trust would inflict greater damage on the firm than a hit on one year's results, he said. .The Italian energy giant sells power to more than 70 million homes and businesses in over 30 countries. .But Enel is planning to leave many of those countries as it focuses on renewable energy and becoming carbon neutral by 2040. .It also wants to cut its huge debts of around $63bn (£52bn). .It is investing heavily in making solar panels as it expands an existing factory in Sicily and builds a new one in the US. .Soaring energy prices have been the biggest contributor to inflation and the cost of living crisis in the UK, the US and the Eurozone. .The global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""showed very clearly how dependence on one single source of energy is dangerous for Europe"", Mr Starace said. .The future will be ""extremely decarbonised"" and depend on nuclear and renewable energy, he said. .However, that shift to renewables also has risks. .In July, the International Energy Agency warned that China's dominance of the solar industry creates ""potential challenges that governments need to address"". .Mr Starace said the West has been over-reliant on China for renewables and other goods. .""Some rebalancing needs to be happening because it is unhealthy,"" he said, when asked about geopolitical tensions interfering with energy supplies. .This has helped drive Enel's investment in solar panels, although the expansion of the Sicilian factory will still meet only 10% of Europe's needs, he said. .Watch: Ros Atkins on...Russian gas and oil .Political leaders have also acknowledged that Europe needs to get its energy from more places. .According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, the EU and its member states have signed 56 energy deals with 23 countries this year. .Among the latest was a 15-year deal for Germany to get liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar through a contract with ConocoPhillips. .Norway is also boosting natural gas production and the world's biggest producer, the US, has been pumping out record amounts. .This means the chances of Europe repeating its dependence on Russia with another country are ""quite low"", according to Megan Richards, a former director of energy policy at the European Commission. .""A lot of work has been done"" to replace Russian energy, she added, before warning: ""I think Europe will not be completely domestically independent for a very, very long time, if ever"" even though ""renewables will increase dramatically"". .You can watch Francesco Starace's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC iPlayer and on BBC World News on Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 08:30 GMT. .Shares rise on hopes cost-of-living crisis easing .Energy bill help for all is too costly - World Bank .US suggests Russia could be behind gas pipe leaks",29
30,30,2 December 2022,Qatar: 'Heartbreak' at Ulster University's campus plan," .The chairperson of Ulster University's (UU) LGBT society has said she is ""heartbroken"" at the university's plans to open a campus in Qatar. .The university is due to open the campus in Lusail in Doha in January 2023. .Qatar has been heavily criticised for the country's human rights record. .UU said that LGBT+ rights are central to their commitment to equality and diversity. .In February 2020, UU established a partnership in Qatar with City University College to offer a range of UU business degree courses to students in Doha and elsewhere. .Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, Hannah McCullough, the chair of the LGBT Society at the Coleraine campus, has said she is worried the university is putting ""financial gain over a community within their community"" and will damage their international reputation. .""Before I came to university I really struggled with my own identity,"" she said. .""It was actually through the society last year and through the support from the university that I was able to accept my own identity. .""That's not going to be an option for those students. It's heartbreaking."" .The World Cup is currently being held in Qatar which has brought a renewed focus on the Middle Eastern country. .Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and human rights organisation Amnesty International has said women and LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, queer or questioning) people ""continue to face discrimination in law and practice"". .Qatar has been heavily criticised over the country's human rights record, including the treatment of migrant workers building stadiums for the competition. .Patrick Corrigan from Amnesty International said: ""We would expect Ulster University to set out how it will protect the rights of construction workers who are building its campus, and the cleaners, cooks and security staff who will work there, given the well-documented exploitation of migrant workers in Qatar. .""As a university committed to academic freedom, we need to know how it will safeguard the freedom of expression and academic freedom of its staff and students in Qatar, including those from the LGBTQ+ community."" .Mr Corrigan said he would expect the university to publish ""comprehensive human rights impact assessments to ensure that it won't be contributing to human rights violations"". .""Ulster University is a registered charity with a public benefit purpose and is in receipt of millions in public funds. People have a right to expect that it's not profiting from or contributing to human rights violations,"" he said. .A spokesperson for Ulster University said that many UK universities were involved in ""active partnerships across the Middle East"" and would be delivering a leadership programme for women. .""Ulster University believes that education is a route for societal growth, facilitating improved global access to higher education and the positive social outcomes that come from that,"" the spokesperson added. .""LGBT+ rights are central to Ulster University's commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion, including through an active LGBT+ staff network that champions equality for all, regardless of gender or sexuality. .""Ulster University has not been involved with or invited to the FIFA World Cup 2022."" .Concern over QUB's Saudi partnership .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup",30
31,31,2 December 2022,"World Cup 2022: 'I am very afraid', says Qatari transgender woman"," .Controversy about Qatar hosting football's World Cup has mostly focused on LGBT rights in the country and around same-sex relationships being criminalised. Transgender Qataris can be detained for ""violating public morality"", which requires no trial or official charge. BBC News has spoken to two trans Qataris about their lives. .""I am very afraid, but I just want people to know that we do exist,"" Shahd says about her decision to speak out about life as a transgender woman. Like the other person in this article, we have changed Shahd's name to protect her. .We have been messaging her over an encrypted app for her safety, and she travels away from her home to video call us in secret from a darkened room. .Shahd shows us her hair which she was forced to cut into a masculine style, but does not reveal by whom. .She then unbuttons her shirt to show us wounds on top of her chest. .Shahd says the wounds are the consequence of being arrested for ""impersonating a woman"". Authorities told her to remove breast tissue that had formed since she started taking oestrogen, which she got without prescription from another country. .""I lost my job and my friends,"" she says. .""I was arrested and interrogated several times because of my identity. I lost everything."" .Qatar is one of more than 60 countries where it is illegal to be gay. In Qatar, homosexual acts are against the law because they are considered immoral under Islamic Sharia law. .Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years - and even death by stoning, although there is no record that this has happened. .Police are able to detain someone for up to six months on suspicion of breaking ""community protection"" laws without trial or charge if they suspect a person has ""violated public morality"". .Shahd says she is constantly in fear of arrest. .A recent report by non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch detailed the arrests of LGBT people in Qatar, and found several trans people were among them, based solely on expressing their gender through clothes, hair or make-up. .Shahd avoids crowded places at busy times of the day, because she feels people stare at her and might report her to the police. .She says she has been arrested for ""imitating a woman"" while wearing make-up, and describes the government's preventive security department - a branch of Qatari law enforcement - as like a ""gang"". .""They capture you and prevent you from telling anyone where you are. The prison is underground where they treat you like a criminal,"" she says. .""You will be handcuffed,"" she said, laughing dryly as she added, ""this is to protect society from us."" .We were unable to independently verify Shahd's account of being arrested, because she received no official record of being detained. .Shahd says anyone who has been to prison for similar reasons to her is sent to a doctor for so-called ""conversion therapy"". She shows us screenshots of her referrals to sessions at a therapy centre in Doha. A Qatari government official denied that the government operates or licenses any ""conversion centres"". .""They told me I might go to hell because of this, but I believe God created me the way I am,"" she said. .""I am a woman. If I could be a man, I would. My life would be much easier."" .Things got so bad for Sara, another transgender woman, that she fled Qatar and is now applying for asylum in Europe. .She tells us how she left everything she knew behind, taking just one bag of belongings and little money. .""I was at my breaking point of either committing suicide or leaving and I decided to leave."" .Sara says she too has been forced through conversion therapy several times. But she does not believe calls to boycott the World Cup over Qatar's laws on homosexuality are productive. .""Many other countries also have these laws, but people are only calling out Qatar and saying Qatar should not be hosting the World Cup."" .The chief executive of football's governing body Fifa has called for attention to be on the competition, rather than politics. However, various charities and organisations are continuing to demand that it gives assurances that no other country with anti-LGBT laws is able to host the World Cup in the future. .Qatar has ""categorically rejected"" the claims made by Shahd and Sara. .A government official reiterated its much-repeated message that ""everyone is welcome"" at the World Cup, and said that fans ""from all walks of life come together in Qatar to build bridges of friendship and break down barriers of misunderstanding"". .The official claimed Qatar ""does not tolerate discrimination against anyone"" and is among the safest countries in the world.

32,32,1 December 2022,World Cup: Shuttle flights cast doubts on carbon-neutral pledge," .In the run-up to the World Cup, Qatar pledged to make this the first carbon-neutral event in the tournament's history. But climate advocates raised serious doubts about its sustainability claims. So, is Qatar living up to its promise? .Due to an acute shortage of hotel rooms in Qatar, tens of thousands of visitors are staying in neighbouring Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates. .A shuttle flight service has been set up to take fans to football matches, with an estimated 500 daily flights in and out of Qatar's capital, Doha. Of those, Dubai in the UAE is operating nearly 120 flights every day. .The environmental cost of transporting fans to the host nation by plane has come under scrutiny. .Will the 2022 World Cup be carbon neutral? .The Paris-based carbon accounting firm Greenly estimates the shuttle flights have resulted in between 6,000 and 8,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions every day since the tournament started. .The immense volume of shuttle flights undermines the organisers' pledge to minimise flying during the tournament, Khaled Diab, of advocacy group Carbon Market Watch, says. .""One of the rationales for having so many stadiums concentrated in a small geographical area was to help reduce emissions related to air travel,"" he says. .The World Cup was expected to attract more 1.2 million visitors, but Qatar only had 30,000 hotel rooms, 80% of which were booked in advance by Fifa for football teams, officials and sponsors. .To boost accommodation options, the organisers offered shared rooms in empty apartments, villas, fan villages and traditional-style tents in the desert. But these options turned out to be quite expensive, forcing many fans to look for other avenues. .Dubai has been packed with fans, with the Dubai Sports Council estimating that there would be one million additional visitors during the course of the tournament. .Shuttle flights allow travellers to book same-day round-trip flights from Dubai or other Gulf locations to attend a match in Qatar and return. Private jets and charters are also in huge demand, with hundreds landing in Qatar every day from around the region. .Mr Diab, from Carbon Market Watch, says their use shows the pledge to make the tournament carbon neutral was never serious. .""If they wanted, they could have looked for other solutions, like driving from neighbouring countries,"" he says. .But Qatar has defended its decisions. .A spokesman for the World Cup Organising Committee says its shuttle service has enabled ""efficient direct flights to and from the Fifa World Cup in Qatar"". .""Direct flights are significantly more carbon effective than flights with stopovers,"" he says. ""At the same time, because of the compact nature of the tournament, domestic flights will not be taken by fans."" .Qatar plans to count emissions produced by the shuttle flights as part of the event's overall carbon footprint. .The organisers expect the World Cup to produce 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, with travel - the largest contributor - accounting for 52% of it. .Independent researchers say that figure is grossly underestimated. Greenly CEO Alexis Normand believes the final count will be at least 70% higher. .The 2022 tournament will be ""the most emissive ever"", he says, adding: ""It's a fantasy to consider that this World Cup is carbon-neutral."" .To make the tournament carbon-neutral, the organisers announced initiatives including solar-powered stadium air conditioning, purchasing carbon credits to offset emissions, and using shipping containers as building materials. .Qatar built seven new stadiums for the World Cup. One, Stadium 974, is made from shipping containers and modular steel, and will be dismantled after the tournament. The others will remain. .In accounting for their carbon footprints, the organisers say these stadiums will be put to meaningful use for decades to come and have assigned them only a small fraction of the emissions associated with their construction. .Mr Normand says this underestimates the true scale of emissions created. .He also says the organisers are relying on purchasing carbon credits to offset emissions, from projects not entirely certified. .Those strategies should change in future, he says: ""These large sporting events need to be looked at as an opportunity to invest in decarbonisation, not the other way round."" .Qatar 2022 to produce 3.6m tons of CO2 .Inside Qatar's £175-a-night World Cup fan village .Qatar World Cup: 'I've only got a room for four nights'",32
33,33,1 December 2022,The Scotland fans making their mark at the Qatar World Cup," .Most Scotland fans have been assuming a familiar position on the sofa for this year's World Cup, with the men's team once again absent from the finals. .The side may not have not qualified for the World Cup since 1998 but some members of the Tartan Army have still made the trip to Qatar to enjoy the football. .Despite logistical, financial and moral concerns, saltires and kilts have been spotted at the Fifa tournament. .Brian Hendry, from Aberdeen, is at his ninth men's World Cup since 1982, but has only seen Scotland play at four of them. .Brian is in Doha with a group of five friends, all in their 60s and originally from the Granite City. .""We're here just to watch football,"" he tells BBC Scotland. ""Supporting France one day, Brazil the next, Mexico the next, America a few times. .""If Scotland can't be there why not watch the best?"" .Brian says he and his kilt-wearing friends have been mobbed at games by international fans who want a picture of Scotland's national dress. .""They love them,"" he says. ""It's hundreds of photos at every game. Hundreds – and it's people from all nationalities."" .Brian, a retired theatre worker, has primarily been backing the USA due to family ties in the country. .He says: ""Scotland have been at the World Cup quite a few times but it doesn't matter if they're not. .""It makes it better if we're here but if they're not it's still great football."" .Among those welcoming the travelling Tartan Army members is Zoe Clark, who moved to Doha from Aberdeen two years ago. .She lives there with her two sons and husband Michael, who runs Qatar's Scotland supporters club. .""For Scotland fans, obviously we haven't experienced a World Cup for a long, long time and it was almost within touching distance this year,"" Zoe says. .""So to see people then coming over and still being able to enjoy it has been incredible."" .Discounted tickets have been offered to Qatar residents, with Zoe and her family taking in games featuring Senegal, Netherlands, France, Spain and other World Cup heavyweights. .They also hope to get tickets for the final at the Lusail Stadium on 18 December. .Her son, Cameron, 12, was also selected as a flag bearer for Brazil's opening match against Serbia. .Yet perhaps more than any other World Cup, Qatar 2022 has been dominated by ethical concerns. .Homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar, with punishments ranging from fines and imprisonment to death by stoning. .Amnesty also says that since the World Cup was awarded to the country in 2010, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers have faced human rights abuses while employed to build wider infrastructure necessary to host the tournament, as well as the venues. .World Cup veteran Brian says this tournament has been ""wonderfully organised"" for fans, who have enjoyed ""brilliant"" weather and ""magnificent"" stadiums. .But he adds: ""We go to the stadiums and we think about the workers. That has to be addressed. .""Then LGBT rights. Of course we're aware of that and can support that but we've also got to remember there are teams here that don't support it."" .He believes sporting events can help ""shine a light"" on such issues. .""They have to be handled, have to be highlighted and hopefully sport can do that, and it has to be done in the right way,"" Brian says. ""Now is the time."" .Qatar 2022 chief executive Nasser al Khater has said laws on homosexuality will not change and visitors should ""respect our culture"". .Ahead of the tournament, both Fifa and Qatar's government hailed progress on labour reforms since the World Cup was awarded to the country in 2010. .""Few countries have come so far so quickly, and Qatar now leads the region on labour rights,"" a spokesman for the government said. .The secret diary of a gay England fan in Qatar .'Worker reforms must go on after Qatar World Cup' .Families seek answers over Qatar building deaths",33

More than 18,000 others are reported to have been arrested. .Iran Human Rights reported that security personnel shot and killed Mehran Samak, 27, when he honked his car's horn in the Caspian Sea city of Bandar Anzali on Tuesday night to celebrate the Iranian football team's defeat. .BBC Persian obtained a video that showed Mr Samak's burial on Wednesday morning. The mourners can be heard chanting ""You are the filth, you are the immoral, I am a free woman"" - a slogan frequently used during the protests. .Iranian security forces have denied killing peaceful protesters. .However, the opposition activist collective 1500tasvir posted videos that it said showed security forces opening fire at people in the south-western city of Behbahan overnight and beating a woman in Qazvin, south of Bandar Anzali. .Other videos showed men and women celebrating the World Cup elimination in Tehran and a number of cities in the predominantly Kurdish north-west of the country. Dozens of protesters have reportedly been killed in recent weeks there as security forces intensified their crackdown. .In footage from Mahsa Amini's home city of Saqqez, dozens of people could be seen cheering and waving scarves in a main square before fireworks are set off. .خوشحالی مردم سقز در محله کریم‌آباد بعد باخت تیم ایران مقابل آمریکا

37,37,30 November 2022,World Cup: Highs and lows of Wales return to tournament," .After making their return to the World Cup after more than six decades, Wales are leaving Qatar much earlier than many had hoped. .It will have been the first time many Welsh fans will have had a nation to support in the competition, however brief. .From a folk song adopted as an anthem to a rousing Hollywood team talk, our small nation left its mark. .Here are some takeaways from Wales' return to football's biggest stage: .Dafydd Iwan's 40-year-old Welsh folk song has been adored by Welsh fans for years, but this tournament brought it to the world stage. .Chosen as Wales' official song for the World Cup, it rang out loud after Wales win against Ukraine secured the team's place at Qatar and was a fixture of the campaign ever since. .Yma o Hyd was Wales' official World Cup song .Tattoo parlours across Wales even reported an increase in people permanently inking the phrase on their bodies in a show of Welsh pride. .Iwan, 78, who was imprisoned for his defence of the Welsh language in 1971, said it has been ""tremendous"" to see the nation embrace his song almost as a second anthem. .""It's as if I've been practising for 39 years to arrive at this point and it was a tremendously fulfilling moment for me,"" he said. .It was not hard to spot a Wales fan in a crowd during the World Cup thanks to the now iconic bucket hat. .You couldn't escape the yellow, green and red hats during the tournament which have become a staple of the Welsh footballing identity. .The hats became so integral to Wales that Gareth Bale handed one to the captain of each team Wales played along with the traditional swap of team pennants. .They were originally launched by Tim Williams' Spirit of 58 shop more than a decade ago, after he was inspired by the Manchester music scene in the 1980s and 90s. .Along with the thousands of hats atop the heads of Wales fans, massive inflatable versions were assembled in Qatar and Wales. .""Every nation has its identifier, I think for Wales it's no longer the red dragon for football but the Welsh bucket hat,"" said Reach plc football reporter Megan Feringa. .The World Cup was played against a backdrop of concern over gay rights in the host nation Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. .Some gay Welsh football fans refused to travel to the tournament, over fears for their own safety. .Prior to the tournament organisers said ""everybody is welcome"", despite homosexuality being punishable by prison. .Former Wales captain Laura McAllister said she was told to remove her LGBT supporting rainbow bucket before attending Wales' opener against the USA. .Laura McAllister said it was important to confront a lack of tolerance .The former FIFA council candidate said she felt ""intimidated"" when told to remove the hat, which she managed the smuggle into the stadium regardless. .The Football Association of Wales also said it was ""frustrated and disappointed"" after FIFA blocked teams from wearing LGBT supporting OneLove armbands during games. .Gareth Bale was one of a number of captains set to wear the armband before FIFA threatened to yellow card any player with one on. .It's no surprise that a team talk given to the Welsh team - which wouldn't have been out of place in a classic sports film - was delivered by Wales' own Hollywood star. .Before the tournament Michael Sheen gave a rousing speech to the team that referenced the late Gary Speed, Wales' last World Cup campaign in 1958 and the legendary ""red wall"" of Wales fans. .""Yma o Hyd you sons of Speed"" .Sheen was presented with a Wales shirt with his name on the back after delivering the speech, and joked he was still available for selection for the squad. .Some fans called for him to travel with the team to Qatar to give speeches before games - which in hindsight might not have been the worst idea. .For Wales not only was it a sporting achievement to reach the World Cup, but a chance to promote itself on the global stage. .Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers attended the tournament, despite Labour leader Keir Starmer banning senior colleagues in England from attending. .Senior Labour MPs also urged the first minister to not attend the tournament due to Qatar's stance on human rights. .The first minister said he believed it was an ""obligation"" to attend and support a Welsh team in its first World Cup in 64 years. .He said he would ""promote inclusivity"" and ""respect for human rights"" during his visit to Qatar. .Economy Minister Vaughan Gething defended the trip, saying: ""We can be proud that we are on this global stage, but there's a great deal more interest in Wales because we are here."" .Despite concerns over human rights and massive costs thousands of Welsh fans travelled to Qatar to support their team at the first World Cup in 64 years. .And hundreds of thousands more were glued to every game at pubs and fan zones throughout Wales, even in Tenerife, Spain. .""I could see through the tears in my own eyes grown men crying"" .For most fans it was the first time in their life they'd seen Wales play at the pinnacle of world football, and much like Euro 2016 it will be a cornerstone of this golden generation for Wales. .Wales fans sang God Save the Queen at the last World Cup in 1958, but fans from countries around the world marvelled as Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau rang out in stadiums across Qatar. .It's been a rollercoaster of optimism followed by broken hearts for fans who dreamed of more, but knew it would be an uphill battle. .Despite the result, the tournament brought the nation together, with the players and fans reminding the world we're still here, and will be for the next one. .Wales' World Cup journey ends, but fans positive .Fans ride on World Cup rollercoaster of emotion .Sheen's speech to Wales squad before World Cup.

46,46,29 November 2022,Yma o Hyd: Welsh World Cup anthem seeing rise in tattoos," .If you've been watching the World Cup, you've probably heard a few renditions of Welsh-language folk song Yma o Hyd. .Meaning ""still here"", Dafydd Iwan's tune has become an anthem for Wales football fans over recent years. .The phrase has also become a popular tattoo - and not just for football fans. .Tattoo parlours said they have noticed an increase in Wales-themed tattoos since the World Cup began. .For James Edwards, 42, who grew up in Pembrokeshire, his tattoo has reflects his Welsh pride, but also something more personal. .""We love the meaning behind it: despite everything that's been thrown at us as a nation, we're still here,"" he said. .""But also, about four weeks ago I got the all clear from bowel cancer so I'm also saying 'I'm still here',"" he added. .The song has gained further popularity with the World Cup, and he said this also affected his choice of tattoo. .He also remembers the first time he heard Yma o Hyd, in a pub in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2019. .""The hairs on the back of your neck were standing up. It was the first time I really remember Welsh fans properly singing it,"" he added. .""It's the first World Cup in my lifetime, we've gotten close many times but to finally make it to the World Cup, which I was going to go to until I fell ill, is an incredible achievement,"" he added. .Yma o Hyd is Wales' official song for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .Yma o Hyd was originally recorded in 1981 and released in 1983. .After Wales qualified for the World Cup last June, it received a flurry of streams and briefly held the number one spot on the iTunes chart. .It tells the story of how Welsh language and culture has survived more than 2,000 years against all the odds. .The chorus goes: ""Er gwaetha pawb a phopeth, ry'n ni yma o hyd"", which translates as ""Despite everyone and everything, we are still here"". .""It's a song of survival really and that resonates with people in various ways,"" Mr Iwan has said. .""We've gone through a dark period, we're coming out the other end and we're going to survive."" .Huw Roberts, 48, from Cardiff, has also been inspired by Wales to incorporate Yma o Hyd into a tattoo. .He booked the tattoo in March to ensure it was healed before the World Cup in Qatar, where he travelled to watch Wales face the USA. .""It's going to be there forever just like the Welsh language and culture,"" he said. .""The song has gained prominence, as has the Welsh language and culture, it's not just fading into the background as some people might hope and obviously the World Cup has brought it massively to the fore as well."" .Lisa Williams, 52, from Flintshire, decided on Yma o Hyd alongside a daffodil as a symbol of her Welsh pride. .""We are still here and that's very important,"" she said. .""It feels good, I've had quite a few compliments on it. It's nice to see everyone posting their hats and shirts on Twitter and I've just got it permanently on me. .""Once you understand the meaning of the song it's very emotional and to see the football fans singing it, it's amazing. .""We'll persevere and keep going regardless of what anyone else tries to enforce on us, we're still Welsh and we always will be."" .Steve White, 36 from Rhosneigr, Anglesey, but who now lives in Manchester, also got a tattoo to symbolise his Welsh pride. .""I have a few tattoos and this one is definitely my favourite.

47,47,29 November 2022,Gay England fan in Qatar's secret World Cup diary," .Phil, 39, is a lifelong football fan who's in Qatar for his fourth World Cup in a row. Qatar has said ""everyone is welcome"", but as a gay man travelling in a country where same-sex relationships are criminalised, he tells us through his diary how the experience has been challenging. .On the way to the World Cup in Russia in 2018, the airport was absolutely packed with fans from around the world, but it just looks like an average Tuesday here tonight. .I've been an England fan for longer than I've known what the word ""gay"" means. My first memories of football are of watching the World Cup in 1990 at my grandparents' house, and being allowed to stay up late for England games. .I'm aware that my decision to go to Qatar puts me in the substantial minority of gay England fans - but if we're serious that the game is for everyone, I'm not going to let Qatar's despicable LGBT rights stop me from enjoying the game that I love. I don't feel I have to choose between being a gay man and an England fan. .I accept that I'm saying that from a position of extreme privilege. There's a layer of protection that applies to me as a western foreigner that wouldn't apply to LGBTQ Qataris. That's what I'm most conflicted about. .I'm just walking out of the stadium after the first game, Japan 2-1 Germany. A superb game. .But it's all very odd here. There's a sterile atmosphere inside the stadiums, no-one seems to quite know what to do. Security are managing things quite closely - there's a specific area to have your flags and banners examined before going in. .On the metro tonight I saw a sign saying football is ""a vehicle for respecting human rights"", to which the obvious question is - but whose human rights? .There is a tonne of security inside the stadiums, more than I've seen at any of the other tournaments. It's curious because the atmosphere here seems to be non-threatening. So what exactly are they looking out for? .I spoke to a gay fan from the Netherlands in a bar earlier. Like me, he feels somewhat conflicted about being here. .I also had one of my dating apps open today and got several messages from Saudi men. So the Qataris may pretend that queer life in the Middle East is dead, but online it's alive and well. .Just finished watching England v USA. At half-time I bumped into an England fan who was wearing a rainbow ribbon, and asked him if he had any issues getting into the stadium. Apparently he was looked over by three or four different people, but was then told, ""oh, it's OK now"". I've also seen a couple of fans in USA jerseys with rainbow numbers on the back, so I guess ""green shoots"" is the phrase. .I've been thinking about that ""football is for everyone"" slogan quite a lot since I've been here. I think the locals genuinely do believe it, they just don't consider gay fans as part of the equation. It's not necessarily homophobic, it's just such a taboo topic that we're invisible. .It's one of the reasons a lot of my fellow LGBT fans haven't been able to come out here - they've felt, for understandable reasons, excluded. .I'm walking out of the stadium at the end of the Australia v Tunisia game. .Just after half-time, a group of Tunisian fans unfurled a massive flag saying ""Free Palestine"". Nothing wrong with that - but when officials talk about keeping politics out of sport, and then a flag that size is allowed in by the flag police at the stadium. .We've watched France vs Denmark in downtown Doha with groups of Mexican, Argentinian and European fans, talking about how this compares to other World Cups. For me, there's a lot to like about how Qatar have run this from a purely football perspective, and on the field there've been some good games. .But what I keep coming back to is the sheer hypocrisy of the messaging, ""say no to discrimination"". I've met a couple of people who've said, ""you're perfectly safe here, why does it matter that you're gay?"". .I know I do have that privilege of being relatively safe compared to LGBT Qataris, but unless you've actually walked in our shoes, and have felt that feeling of unease, of feeling excluded, it's very hard to describe. .I'm about to get on my flight back to the UK, so, signing off for the last time in Qatar. .When Qatar was awarded the World Cup in 2010, there was an outcry - but it was more about the corruption allegations, not LGBT rights. Perhaps that's a measure of the progress within Europe and the UK. .Have I ever felt concerned for my safety here? No. Do I think I would've done, under other circumstances? Also no again. But do I feel that my experience here has been compromised by knowing what happens to the local LGBT population? Yes, I do. .We're told to just ""focus on the football"", but there are things in life that are more important. .As told to Josh Parry and Ashitha Nagesh. Phil shared his experience with us through voice notes on an encrypted messaging app. We are not publishing his full name. .Being an LGBT football fan from the Middle East .'A desert World Cup and a dust-storm of controversy' .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup",47
48,48,28 November 2022,China Covid: Chinese TV censors shots of maskless World Cup fans," .The phrase ""football is nothing without fans"" has become so accepted as to be cliché among some commentators. But Chinese state TV has been testing that assumption to its limit throughout the World Cup. .On Monday, as Ghana beat South Korea in a classic World Cup clash, subtle changes to China's coverage of the match ensured viewers were not exposed to images of maskless supporters - and to a world moving on from Covid restrictions. .Those watching on the BBC - and in most places around the world - will have seen their screens filled with the image of a beaming, maskless, Ghana fan celebrating excitedly as the camera zooms in. .After Mohammed Kudus fired home the winner in the 68th minute, images of dancing and cheering fans - as well as shots of anxious South Korea fans - were beamed around the world. .But not in China, where those watching on the state broadcaster's sports channel, CCTV 5, will have experienced these moments differently. .Instead of being shown the raucous fans, Chinese viewers saw the reactions of South Korea's coach Paulo Bento and Ghana manager Otto Addo. .And as the game reached its conclusion, shots of tearful South Korea supporters with their heads in their hands were conspicuously absent on the Chinese output. .The change is subtle but very deliberate. .As anti-lockdown protests rock China, state TV executives have been careful to avoid beaming images of a world largely moving on from Covid-19 restrictions into citizens' homes. .It is not unusual for broadcasters at major tournaments to be given the option of choosing their own camera angles, and some often set a slight delay to allow the editing and selection of pictures before the public sees them. .The BBC observed that there was roughly a 52-second delay between its own coverage of the match and CCTV 5's. .But in this case, the changes appear to have come after images of maskless fans celebrating in packed stadiums stoked anger in China, where snap lockdowns and restrictions remain commonplace and controversial. .Social media users in China were quick to notice the change, with many expressing frustration at how differently the rest of the world now seems to be treating Covid. .An open letter questioning China's ongoing zero-Covid policies and asking if it was ""on the same planet"" as Qatar quickly spread on messaging app WeChat last week, before being censored. .""On one side of the world, there is the carnival that is the World Cup, on the other are rules not to visit public places for five days,"" one user of the Weibo social media platform wrote. .Even the state-backed Global Times newspaper has conceded that some fans are ""choosing to watch the games at home with their families"" as many Chinese cities remain under restrictions. .And while wide angle shots showing some maskless fans are impossible to avoid completely, close up images of supporters enjoying the action free from restrictions are unlikely to return for Chinese fans. .Zero-Covid China asks: Is World Cup on another planet? .Why I have to censor myself online .China's fury and fear of Covid puts Xi in a bind",48

""This is a unique World Cup with all the matches in Doha, as opposed to being spread across a country or even countries."" .Finding supporters from countries like Mexico and Argentina with huge fan contingents was easy, he said. .But Sam said he and the six friends he travelled with had to scour the airport, metro stations, international sports bars in hotels and even souks to find fans from smaller countries like Ghana, Costa Rica and even Switzerland. . ""By the last few countries it almost felt like I was playing a large scale hide and seek in Doha,"" he explained. .""When I eventually found my last in a Swiss couple it felt like being reunited with long lost family members.” .He said he got his last fan picture just hours before flying home. .“It was great meeting fans from all around the world who were all as excited as us to be there,"" he said.  .“Everyone I asked was more than happy to have a photo and it often led to a great little exchange on where they had come from and their hopes for the tournament. .‘’My favourite picture is definitely when we were joined by a group of Saudi Arabians on the metro who had just pulled off one of the biggest World Cup upsets beating Argentina. .""I feel like you can even hear that picture.’’ .As well as seeing the first two Wales games in his week-long stay, Sam also managed to get tickets to see France beat Australia, Japan shock Germany and Brazil defeat Serbia. .”I have been one many fans collecting the official World Cup Panini stickers but this was my chance to have my own little collection of fans up close and personal. . ”We might not win the World Cup this year - but I'm delighted at getting fans from every country in the back of the net."" .

50,50,28 November 2022,World Cup: Wales fans ride on World Cup rollercoaster," .It has been a big rollercoaster of emotions for Wales fans in Qatar, and they are gearing up for what could be one last ride. .The World Cup has been a journey of highs and lows. .After the Iran defeat many have reined in expectations, and have now resigned themselves to just being happy to be part of the global jamboree. .But how much confidence should they have that the team can defy the odds and qualify for the knockout stages? .The team will need to beat England and hope the other match ends in a draw, but many fans are still too numb from the 2-0 loss to Iran - in a game many expected to win - to carry much hope. .Describing football as ""an emotional rollercoaster"", psychologist Dr Simon Williams said Wales fans have experienced increased stress because of the growing importance of the side in the national consciousness and expectation. .""Research shows that the more closely we identify with a team - what psychologists sometimes call identity fusion - the more our bodies experience stress and anxiety when we watch the game,"" he said. .""And so, this World Cup will already have been more stressful than useful for Wales fans, because of how much more prominent football is in the country these days and because the feeling of closeness or even being part of the team is so central to their success - of 'together stronger'."" .With this being the case, he believes resuming the tag of ""underdog"" may actually benefit the side and supporters versus England. .A massive tidal wave of emotion had engulfed the nation in the build-up to the tournament, which reached a crescendo during the anthems for the USA game. .There was hope and expectation with Tim Williams, from Llandybie, Carmarthenshire, describing that as ""a crunch game"", adding beforehand: ""I hope we have enough to beat a young USA side. I think we will."" .The tears at the anthem turned to silent reflection as that young US side turned on the style and fans became worried it was about to end before it had really started. .Gareth Bale's equaliser raised the roof and fans were on a massive high again. .Nerys John from Y Felinheli, Gwynedd, said it gave Y Draig Goch exposure like it had never had before and the side a platform to build on. .Iran's 6-2 defeat to England had raised expectations further. Anne Hawkins, 63, from Swansea, was one of hundreds of fans saying she was ""quite confident"" ahead of playing them. .But it was stark how differently the thousands of Iranian fans viewed the match - they had almost written off the England game beforehand, and saw it as a three-way shootout for second spot. .Saeed Izadi, who lives in Singapore, was in buoyant mood, adding: ""If we win, we have a good chance of going through, we are playing for second place. .""It's a do or die game."" .His confidence felt well-founded, with Wales fans deflated at the result, but then resolving to simply bask in their time in the World Cup sun. .Dr Williams said Wales are used to being underdogs, and the effect of this psychologically can be quite powerful. .""This underdog effect can be felt by the players, which in turn effects the fans' confidence,"" he said. .""And so, the initial feeling of 'cautious optimism' against the USA turned to expectation - perhaps over-expectation - against Iran, which may have had a counter-productive effect."" .Looking ahead to the England match, he said ""social identity and passion"" can play a big role in such a ""David versus Goliath encounter"". .He also believes mindsets have changed, which could work in Wales' favour. .""Wales are firmly underdogs against England, and so both players and fans won't be feeling the same weight of expectation that they did against Iran,"" he added. .""Most people in Wales are likely to go back to very cautious optimism. .""On the other hand, England, as favourites, have pressure to perform and so that needs to be managed psychologically, in order to avoid complacency. And so, you never know."" .""We need a present from Father Christmas,"" joked Terry John, 66, from Cardiff. .He does not think he will be using his last 16 ticket, but added: ""England haven't been at their best either and won't look forward to playing us. .""It will be like a local derby, same as when they played Scotland."" .His friend Richard Crawley, 65, also was not optimistic saying: ""I was just over the moon to get over here and didn't think we would qualify from the group… but there's always hope."" .Tears and emotion as Wales return to World Cup .No hangovers as fans enjoy Qatar and watch Messi",50

52,52,27 November 2022,World Cup: Wales fans remember Gary Speed 11 years after death," .For many Wales fans, the journey to the World Cup in Qatar didn't start in qualifying or even with the current group of players. .It was almost 50 years ago, on playing fields in Flintshire, that the ethos and everything around this side began to take shape. .It is 11 years ago today that former player, captain and manager Gary Speed left us. .Yet, he will live forever in the eyes of Wales' football fans. .""He started it all, started the ball rolling. He wanted us to play like he did, 'give me the ball',"" said Stuart Smith, 42, from Blackwood, Caerphilly. .""He didn't want us to just scrape by any more, he wanted us to play, how we do now. He gave us confidence in our football and shaped our game as it is today."" .Describing him as ""a proper Welsh hero"", Mr Smith added: ""He changed the mindset of Welsh football."" .A minute's silence was held at Wales' training ground on Sunday in Speed's memory - and he is not far from fans' thoughts as they support the team in Qatar. .Arwel Williams, 48, from Eglwys Bach, Conwy, perhaps spoke for most Welsh people when he said he remembers the moment, and exactly where he was, when he heard of Speed's death. .""I was playing golf in Abergele, I couldn't believe it. But he's here with us in spirit,"" he added. .Dawn Williams, 47, agreed, saying the fans will never forget, singing about him at games to this day, while Tony Hughes, 55, from Narberth, Pembrokeshire, said: ""We would still be in the dark ages if it wasn't for him."" .As manager between 2010 and 2011, he mentored players such as Aaron Ramsey, paving the way for Chris Coleman to lead the side to Euro 2016. .Speed, who was 42 when he took his own life, won 85 caps and suffered World Cup heartbreak himself as part of the side that narrowly lost out on qualification for USA 1994. .""He would be so proud of the boys, whether he was part of this squad now or not, he was a proper Welshman,"" said Simon Brown, 55, from Monmouth. .He added: ""Not a lot of people outside the country knew where Wales was, they may know Gareth Bale, or say it's in the UK or even in London. .Gary's dream has become a reality.

He was so approachable and didn't look down on anyone,"" he added. .When the National Anthem plays before games at the World Cup ""your mind naturally turns to him"", said Andy Phillips, 50, from Llansteffan, Carmarthenshire. .He added that when he came in as manager, the set-up was unprofessional and disorganised, but he completely changed it. .""When he came in, Wales became almost like a club side,"" he said. .""The organisation and resources increased tenfold. He is massively responsible for where we are now."" .Speaking about his death, he added: ""If it did anything, it shed a spotlight on mental health and we must check in to make sure people are alright."" .The sense of loss among Wales football fans is still evident 11 years on and yet, even thousands of miles away from home, Gary Speed is still very much with them. .How did Wales celebrate World Cup qualification? .Mural tribute to former Wales manager Gary Speed .Gary Speed's mum on sadness that never goes away",52

55,55,26 November 2022,World Cup: Songs help partially-sighted Wales fan enjoy games," .Wales being the Land of Song has an extra special meaning for one fan - who is experiencing the World Cup through music. .Cai Emlyn Davies lost most of his sight when he was nine and is not able to follow the action clearly on the pitch. .So it was the euphoria that resonated in the stands that told him Gareth Bale nailed the equaliser against the USA. .For Cai, Wales as a footballing nation goes hand-in-hand with it being a musical one as well. .As much as it is about the exploits on the pitch, it is about the goose bumps of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau and the raw emotion of Yma O Hyd. .It is about the music of the Barry Horns and the Red Wall singing Calon Lan, Don't Take Me Home or Men of Harlech that connects him to the action. .""I think losing my sight at such a young age has helped me further along in life as I've had to learn to live with it,"" said Cai. .""My sight loss doesn't stop me doing my day-to-day activities and I'll always be grateful for what vision I have got - many people I know suffer far worse than I do, I count myself lucky most of the time."" .Like the rest of the nation, he waited on tenterhooks for Bale to take his penalty against the USA - and he didn't need to see it hit the net, he could feel it all around him. .The 27-year-old was born with a genetic disorder called Neurofibromatosis, meaning he gets lumps and lesions on his skin and nerves. .When a tumour appeared on his optic nerve, he lost 80% of his vision, but it could never affect his love of football, which he said was ""from birth"". .Both his parents played and some of his earliest memories are watching his dad star for his hometown Newcastle Emlyn in Carmarthenshire. .Cai, who works for Cardiff council and plays for a visually impaired rugby team, added: ""It means everything, to witness something I thought I'd never see is just the stuff of dreams. I just hope we can get out of the group."" .He has travelled with parents Richard and Nia and their friends Morlais and Anwen, who have ensured his sight loss has not affected the trip too much. .They are staying in Dubai and flying into Qatar for each Wales game. .Cai added: ""They've guided me along the way and they've been my eyes for me. .""And definitely, even though I might not see everything going on around me, I can hear and feel the atmosphere."" .RNIB Cymru's director Ansley Workman said Cai's love of live football showed ""how diverse the red wall is"". .""We know that some blind and partially sighted people can be put off from attending live matches, but Cai's experience shows that anything is possible,"" she added. .""Being at a live match is a sensory experience, from the smell of the turf to the experience of the Welsh fans in full voice singing the national anthem."" .At the World Cup, Cai and thousands of others have partied to the music of The Barry Horns - a group that is playing a significant role in re-energising Wales' image as the Land of Song. .Based in Dubai and flying into Qatar, the band have already played in embassies in both countries, in the stadium and at a number of packed and passionate fan events. .""The people over here have been amazingly welcoming, not just the fans, but the locals too,"" said the band's Gareth Evans. .""A highlight has been playing in the stadium for Wales in the actual World Cup, which hasn't actually sunk in. .""The response at the gigs we've been doing around the games is incredible so far and we're buzzing to be part of it all."" .While the brass band's name pays homage to former Wales star Barry Horne, their music eulogises various heroes on the pitch. .A song featuring Hal Robson-Kanu's name to the beat of Salt-N-Pepa's Push It became popular after his wonder goal against Belgium at Euro 2016. .Another familiar face from that tournament - Joe Ledley - also joined the group on stage in Dubai for a spot of dubious trumpet playing as they sang about him at an event to mark the start of the World Cup. .Many legends were created during the Euros in France six years ago - it remains to be seen who of this current side will step forward and be sung about for years to come. .Wales to Qatar electric car attempt falls short .Tears and emotion as Wales return to World Cup .Wales LGBT fans 'disrespected' at World Cup opener",55

The demonstrations spread across the country with people demanding changes such as more freedoms or an overthrow of the state, and the government has responded with a deadly crackdown. .On Friday - at Iran's World Cup game against Wales - some protesters had Persian pre-revolutionary flags snatched from them by pro-government fans at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. .Insults were also reportedly hurled at some people wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the words ""woman, life, freedom"" - a phrase that has become a rallying cry among protesters against Iran's authorities. .One Iranian spectator alleged that Qatari police ordered her to wash off the names of protesters killed by Iran's security forces from her arms and chest after pro-government fans complained. .Another woman said she was prevented from wearing a T-shirt with Ms Amini's face in the stadium. .Watch: A woman wearing a Mahsa Amini T-shirt was stopped ahead of Iran's World Cup match .Women giving interviews to foreign press about the protests were also seen being harried by at least one group of men. .Some used their mobiles to film the women who were also subjected to verbal attacks and the men loudly chanting: ""The Islamic Republic of Iran"". .The match itself, which Iran won 2-0 against Wales, saw Iranian players booed and whistled at as they sang the country's national anthem before kick-off. .At their earlier game against England on Monday, the players remained silent during the anthem in an apparent expression of support for anti-government protests. .Some fans in the stadium wore hats with the name of former Iranian football player, Voria Ghafouri, written on them. .A critic of Iran's government, he was arrested in Iran on Thursday and reportedly taken away by authorities after being accused of spreading propaganda. .Capped 28 times for his country, Mr Ghafouri was part of Iran's 2018 World Cup team and his absence from the 2022 squad surprised many. .The Iranian-Kurdish player has been a high profile voice defending Iranian Kurds within the country. .Earlier this week, the UN Human Rights Council voted to set up a fact-finding mission to investigate the crackdown on the anti-government protests in Iran. .The UN said Iran was in a ""full-fledged"" crisis and more than 300 people had been killed and 14,000 others arrested over the past nine weeks. .Iran dismissed it as an arrogant political ploy. .Why the World Cup in Qatar is so controversial .A really simple guide to Iran's protests .UN fact-finding mission to probe Iran crackdown .How Qatar’s riches touch millions of UK lives .Wales fans miss game after entry cards 'glitch'",56

I've been here five or six nights and not been to bed on three of those,"" he said. .""The welcome when we arrived in Qatar (on Friday's flight) brought tears to my eyes. They were holding up signs welcoming us here,"" he said. .""Lots of things have been emotional - I was crying before the second Gwlad during the anthem on Monday. .There have certainly been plenty of tears already in Qatar. .Monday's game was simply about the emotion for some, with Freya Powell, 49, from Bargoed, Caerphilly county, saying: ""During the anthem, I turned around and could see everyone had tears in their eyes. .""I could see, through the tears in my own eyes, grown men crying."" .There have also been tears in Dubai where dozens of Wales fans have been turned away at the airport - and have missed the match - because a ""glitch in the system"" meant their entry permit for Qatar has not been accepted. .One person who got in - with her rainbow bucket hat - was former Wales women's captain Laura McAllister. .She had been told to remove the LGBT symbol when entering the stadium for the USA match but Fifa has ordered World Cup organisers to allow rainbow-coloured hats and flags into stadia for the rest of the tournament. .Mewn 🌈🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿💪 pic.twitter.com/ZBoUpeLar7 .Of course, most Welsh fans watched the game back home in pubs, fans zones and even having lessons suspended in schools, all across the country. .For one Iranian woman living in Wales, Friday's match was about much more than football. .Shara Atashi, who fled Iran with her mother in 1979 following the Islamic revolution, sees echoes of that time in the current protests happening in Iran. .""When I watch today's scenes of protest, I am reminded of those days: bonfires everywhere, burning tyres, people shouting slogans and spreading flyers,"" she said. .Ms Atashi, a writer with German citizenship, moved to Wales in 2019 and made it her adopted home, as it ""gave me back my original identity"". .Because of the situation in her home country, Ms Atashi was supporting Wales. .""The Islamic Republic [Iran] coach has told Iranian protesters not come to the stadium to protest. That shows how authoritarian this whole system is. .""I want people in Wales to know that Wales will be playing against the Islamic Republic, not a team of honourable athletes. That Iranians want Wales to win because the Iran team does not represent Iranians."" .""It does not happen often that the people of a country want their own country's football team to lose. It is not enough that this team did not sing the national anthem,"" added Ms Atashi. .""They should drop out of the games and join the protests."" .Mehdi Darian, 42, originally from Iran but who lives in Cardiff, also supported Wales with his family. .He moved back to Wales with his wife Siobhan, 43, who is from Cardiff, and sons Nathaniel, eight, and Noah, three, after living in Dubai for 10 years. .""[Nathaniel] is properly following Wales, he cried - he almost smashed the house down when America scored,"" said Mehdi. .""He asked me, he said 'who are you going to support, Wales or Iran?' I said obviously Wales. .""I could see the happiness in his face. .""Nobody supports the current situation going on in Iran. We believe in representing the people, which the Iranian regime does not."" .He added: ""I used to be a goalkeeper myself, when Iran lost to England my friend texted me 'go get your gloves and go to Qatar to help your team'. .""I was like 'no that's not my team, my team is Wales'. I see myself as a Welshman because my family is Welsh."" .Schools across Wales paused lessons to allow pupils to watch. .Matthew Evans, head of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf in Cardiff, said multiple school halls and gymnasiums were set up to show the match. .""We've seen an increase in bucket hats and random singing of Yma o Hyd on the yard and on school corridors,"" he said. .Back in Qatar, Sian Thomas, 52, from Cardiff, said: ""Seeing a massive Wales flag next to the World Cup trophy [at the opener], I just thought we had arrived. .""Now we know what to expect.

The country maintains a zero-Covid policy, where entire communities are locked down over single cases of the virus, in order to prevent it from spreading. .China is currently experiencing its worst outbreak in six months, and localised lockdowns have surged over the last couple of weeks. In the past 24 hours, China has recorded more than 28,000 new cases; these are in every single provincial-level region. .Football is very popular in China. President Xi Jinping is known for being a lover of the sport, and he has spoken previously of it being a dream for the country to win the World Cup . .As a result, matches are being shown on national broadcaster CCTV, and state media have sought to amplify China's ""presence"". The Global Times has reported on how China-made products ""ranging from buses to the [Lusail] stadium, and even air conditioning units are well represented at the event"". .Leading outlets such as CCTV have also promoted the presence of Chinese flagbearers at the opening ceremony, and how two giant pandas arrived in Qatar to ""meet"" visitors arriving for the event. .But it is evident that Covid-19 has put a damper on the celebrations. In major cities, outbreaks have resulted in non-essential businesses once again closing, and people being urged to limit their movements. .With no bars to go to, the Global Times newspaper says some fans are ""choosing to watch the games at home with their families"". Others have also reportedly taken to camping sites. .Flights between Qatar and China also remain severely limited for those hoping to watch the event in person. .Many are feeling acute isolation watching this year's event. .An open letter questioning the country's continued zero-Covid policies and asking if China was ""on the same planet"" as Qatar quickly spread on mobile messenger WeChat on Tuesday, before being censored. .Comments on the Twitter-like Weibo social network are rife from viewers who speak about how watching this year's matches is making them feel divided from the rest of the world. .Some speak of their perception that it is ""weird"" to see hundreds of thousands of people gathering, without wearing masks or needing to show evidence of a recent Covid-19 test. ""There are no separate seats so people can maintain social distance, and there is nobody dressed in white and blue [medical] garb on the sidelines. This planet has become really divided."" .""On one side of the world, there is the carnival that is the World Cup, on the other are rules not to visit public places for five days,"" one says. .Some say they have had difficulty explaining to their children why the scenes from the World Cup are so different to those people face at home. .There are many in China, though, who have been critical of countries overseas opening up while the World Health Organization still calls the Covid-19 virus an ""acute global emergency"". .However, there is no end in sight to China's existing measures. This week, the National Health Commission spokesman ""warned against any slacking in epidemic prevention and control"" and urged ""more resolute and decisive measures"" to bring cases under control. .Local governments in major cities have reintroduced mass testing and travel restrictions and ultimately delivered a message that people should try to stay at home. .But after three years of such measures, people are frustrated, resulting in protests in the last month in both the cities of Guangzhou and Zhengzhou. .Watch: Protesters tear down Covid control barriers in Guangzhou, China .Read how Covid is rising again in China .Beijing faces its most severe Covid test",69

71,71,24 November 2022,How Qatar’s riches touch millions of UK lives," .Qatar hosting the World Cup has drawn widespread criticism over its record on rights for women, LGBTQ+ groups and migrant workers. The attendance of officials, teams, even fans has been questioned. But our connection with Qatar goes way beyond the current tournament, touching most of our lives. .Some may query if we are right to foster such ties with a regime whose values may appear to be at odds with British ones. .At the core of that relationship is gas. Qatar is a tiny country about the size of Yorkshire but it has one of the largest natural reserves on the planet - and the UK is a key customer. .About half our gas is imported and about half of that comes via a pipeline from Norway. But Qatar is second on that list supplying about 9% of our energy imports. In theory, that's the amount needed to power the boilers of around a million British homes. In the space of less than 20 years, Qatar has become a vital part of our energy mix. .Qatar has channelled its booming gas-based wealth into embedding itself into the UK's corporate and property landscape, and cementing a relationship with the top tiers of British establishment. .Its monarch, the Emir, was one of the few Gulf leaders to attend the Queen's funeral. The current King accepted a donation for his charitable foundation worth over £2m (part of which was allegedly handed over in Fortnum and Mason's carrier bags) from a former Qatari political leader in 2015. .Highly unusually, our nations' air forces have formed two joint squadrons - one of which is patrolling the skies above World Cup venues. .And in September, Qatar took ownership of 24 fighter jets built in Lancashire, part of a £5bn deal with BAE systems. .On the ground, the Qatari government has been recycling some of its cash by investing in the UK. It's not one of our largest investors - but its holdings are strategically chosen to maximise profile and influence. It is among the dozen biggest property owners in Britain. .Central to its property empire are landmarks including the Shard, Canary Wharf and the Shell Centre redevelopment on London's South Bank. .The Qatari government also owns luxury department store Harrods and 5* hotel Claridge's in London. .And in our day-to-day life it has significant shareholdings some of our biggest brands. Bank with Barclays, shop at Sainsbury's or use Heathrow airport, and Qatar benefits. Turn on the tap as a Severn Trent water customer, and your bill adds to its profits. .In total, Qatar's state investment arm has invested about £40bn, in areas which touch millions of British lives, and designed to ensure the influence of that tiny country punches far above its weight on British soil. .And they are funds our government has welcomed - and is keen to boost. In May, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson trumpeted an agreement for Qatar to invest up to £10bn over the next five years in the UK in sectors from cybersecurity to life sciences. .Meanwhile, our reliance on Qatari gas could rise in the future. The UK government has been nurturing the relationship with Doha, to ensure security of supply as North Sea reserves dwindle. .Britain in recent months has succeeded in cutting out imports from Russia. That was only about 4% of the UK total - but it makes the gas we source from Qatar even more crucial. .The EU is far more reliant on Russian gas, so securing alternatives is even more pressing. .Overall, the EU only got 5% of its gas from Qatar - but that could change. Olaf Scholz, chancellor of the bloc's biggest gas guzzler - Germany - has said that Qatar will play a central role in the country's strategy to diversify away from Russian gas. But it won't happen overnight. .Contract negotiations have been tricky. Qatar likes to supply gas under long-term deals, lasting 15-20 years, which may not be consistent with Western nations aims to decarbonise. .By contrast, China, with its less ambitious net-zero plans, has unveiled a 27-year agreement to buy a massive $60bn worth of Qatari gas. And Germany needs to boost its infrastructure, the terminals which receive the liquified natural gas - known as LNG - in order to take on more supplies. .The UK is ahead of the game in the latter - thanks to cooperation from Qatar. The country is a majority owner of the South Hook terminal in Wales, where LNG is offloaded into special containers. It's claimed the site can hold a fifth of the UK's daily gas needs - the Qatari government is investing millions to up that capacity by a quarter by 2025. .And by that point, Qatar is expecting to double its LNG output - with no shortage of customers. Many Asian nations are vying with Europe to tie down supplies to ensure energy security - and Qatar is seen as a relatively reliable and geopolitically tame option. The alternatives may not be attractive: for example, while part of the world's largest gas field falls in Qatari water, the rest lies in Iran's (the two countries produce gas independently). .Some of us may not be able to locate the country on a map but our relationship with Qatar seems set only to become closer in the years to come. .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup .Qatar: Buying Britain by the pound",71

75,75,23 November 2022,World Cup: How Wales uses sport to sell itself globally," .Wales has just played the world's richest nation on the planet's biggest sporting stage. .In terms of international profile, it does not get much bigger than taking on the USA in the football World Cup. .It also marks the culmination of more than 20 years of using sport to sell Wales around the globe. .It has been a remarkable period for hosting events, with Wales' sporting stars taking part in competitions internationally. .Cardiff has seen the Rugby World Cup in 1999, FA Cup finals at what was then the Millennium Stadium in the 2000s, the Ashes in 2009 at Sophia Gardens, the first event of the 2012 Olympics as GB played New Zealand in women's football, as well as the Champions League final in 2017. .There was also the Ryder Cup in Newport in 2010, and who can forget Wales' spectacular run to the Euros semi-finals in France in 2016, and Geraint Thomas's Tour de France triumph in 2018. .Carwyn Jones' time as first minister coincided with much of it, and he believes Wales' involvement in the World Cup in Qatar is the end of a journey which began with the 1999 opening of the Millennium Stadium - now the Principality Stadium. .He believes the country's involvement in sport was helped by the fact that both he and his predecessor, Rhodri Morgan, were ""big sports anoraks"". .He said: ""It was an understanding, we both knew that being able to have a strong presence on the international sporting stage was the pathway to creating more interest in Wales, and therefore boosting the Welsh economy further down the line. .""There is no question that it has helped boost Wales' image."" .Mr Jones is happy to admit that the involvement in the 2016 Euros alone created a greater profile for the country than any politician could have done. .But has it worked in creating the kind of economic improvements many claimed would benefit the country as a result? .It has been a hotly debated question over the years, particularly when public funds were used to promote and bring showpiece events to Wales, but it is virtually impossible to put an accurate figure on how much cash is generated in both the short and long term from such events. .When Wales was successful in attracting foreign-owned companies to invest here, it was often used as a reason to take part. .But the economic picture is very different now, and inward investment is not the focus it once was. .In fact, Mr Jones believes one of the biggest benefits from major sporting events is not all about foreign investment or tourism, but about the people of Wales. .""It helps create a sense of confidence among our own people,"" he said. .""We have historically not done very well in terms of people starting up businesses and growing them, a lack of confidence perhaps, people thinking 'I cannot go much further'. .""How many times have we said that sometimes in Wales there is a limit to what we can do? .""Our sports teams, and the fact that we have hosted big events successfully, shows we can be up there with the best in the world. .""It has given us a sense of confidence we never had before, and that then projects itself around the world."" .Calvin Jones, an economist at Cardiff Business School, has studied the economic impact of hosting or taking part in large sporting events. .Initially sceptical about the benefits, he has softened his stance, now saying that in financial terms you cannot put a price on it, but agrees that there are benefits culturally, and in terms of the feelgood factor. .He cited the buyout of Wrexham AFC by actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney as an example. .""If you think about what has happened in Wrexham with the takeover, and the outpouring of love between two Hollywood stars and a town, it's an unalloyed good news story, it makes people feel better about Wrexham and it's on TV's around the world, that I think has benefits that are completely distinct from an economic impact. .""You can say the same about the way that sports teams, and in particular the football team, and I would include Paralympics and others in this, have come to embody a sense of confident and inclusive Welshness. .He said the way the narrative with the fans' support group the Red Wall has developed is that football means something, and it's supposed to say something about Wales. .""That is all really good, as long as you don't expect much from it beyond the generic 'it's all good stuff' because the monetisation of profile is incredibly hard to trace - that is not to say there are not any benefits. .""If we think what Cardiff would look like without the [Principality] Stadium, without all those events, if Cardiff was not a visitor city it would be completely different."" .Calvin Jones said he was very cynical throughout most of the 90s about sporting events, but at the same time could see the cultural benefits. .""Looking back over the past 15 years, if we had not had Madonna at the stadium, if we had not had the Manics [Street Preachers] on New Year's Eve, and all those wonderful things that have happened off the back of sporting success, if we had not had the [rugby] Grand Slams, and the football we now have, then Wales would have been an unhappier place, if only for that, it has been worth it,"" he added. .There are times when it is difficult to imagine Wales without the profile of sport, such has been its impact over the past 20 years. .Wales' image globally has been forged through sport, and the World Cup in Qatar is the latest striking example yet of how successful it can be. .Wales savour their World Cup moment in time .Wales fans' rise from counterculture to mainstream .Welsh sport 'worth £3.4bn to society'",75
76,76,23 November 2022,"Qatar has taken 'real steps' for safety of gay fans, says foreign secretary"," .Qatar has taken ""real steps"" to ensure the safety of gay fans attending the World Cup, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has said. .Mr Cleverley told the BBC he had had ""difficult conversations"" with Qatari counterparts and had been clear how seriously the UK takes the issue. .The build-up to the tournament has seen concerns raised over LGBT as well as broader human rights in Qatar. .Homosexuality remains illegal under the country's laws. .Mr Cleverly has just returned from Qatar, where he met with British police and consular officials as well as ministers from the Qatari government. .He is the most senior British minister to attend the World Cup so far. .Asked whether Qatar was safe for gay fans, he said gay rights was an issue he had ""brought up over a number of years"" while working with the hosts in preparation for the event. .""I've made it clear that we feel very strongly about this issue and actually one of the advantages about having a strong relationship with other countries is you can have these difficult conversations,"" he said. .""The Qataris know how seriously we take this issue and they have taken real steps to ensure that gay football fans are safe and do feel secure and can enjoy the football."" .Mr Cleverly was asked whether he thought fans should be allowed to wear rainbow hats in support of LGBT rights while attending games. .Fans attending Wales' match against the United States on Monday, including former women's team captain Laura McAllister, reported being told to remove the hats ahead of the game. .Ms McAllister later said the behaviour of officials at the game had been ""pretty heavy handed"" and ""quite intimidating"". .Mr Cleverly said that the ""rules for what goes on in the stadia"" were a matter for Fifa and the football authorities. .Speaking to LBC ahead of the tournament, he called on fans to ""please... be respectful of the host nation"" and show ""a little bit of flex and compromise"". .Asked by the BBC whether the economic and security benefits of the UK's relationship with Qatar were more important than promoting its values abroad, he said it was a ""completely artificial choice"". .""The values underpin everything we do,"" he said. ""At no point in [the conversations I recently had with my Qatari opposite number] did we bring up any of the kind of economic or commercial stuff. .""This was about ensuring that the English and Welsh fans going over to enjoy the football were safe and happy and that they enjoyed themselves whilst watching the tournament."" .Foreign secretary to travel to Qatar for World Cup .Belgium to drop 'love' from away shirts in Qatar .England and Wales will not wear OneLove armbands",76
77,77,23 November 2022,Gary Lineker: BBC should have spoken up about Russia at 2018 World Cup," .Watch: Gary Lineker on ""sportswashing"" and World Cup 2018 in Russia .Football presenter Gary Lineker has said he and the BBC should have spoken out more about human rights issues during the World Cup in Russia in 2018. .Lineker, who is fronting BBC coverage of this year's World Cup in Qatar, said: ""I think we were sportswashed four years ago when we were in Russia."" .He added: ""I do look back four years and feel slightly uncomfortable."" .There were calls for Russia to be stripped of the 2018 tournament after it annexed Crimea in 2014. .Lineker told BBC Radio 4's The Media Show that ""we didn't talk perhaps enough about the other issues"" as well as the football in Russia. .This time around, the BBC panel of pundits did discuss human rights issues in Qatar ahead of Sunday's opening game. .Lineker said ""it was deemed the right thing to do"" to not just talk about the sport. .""I think we learned from what we probably felt was a mistake [with Russia]. I think looking back now in hindsight, we should probably have spoken out more."" .BBC Sport said it would not be commenting. .Sportswashing is when a country or organisation seeks to improve its reputation by hosting or sponsoring a big sports event. .Lineker delivered a monologue at the start of the BBC's coverage in Qatar this weekend, describing the event as ""the most controversial World Cup in history"". .He told Media Show presenter Ros Atkins that the monologue and subsequent discussions with fellow presenters such as former England women's player Alex Scott ""was a decision by everyone in BBC Sport and these things are all thought through a lot, it wasn't just me"". .He added: ""Every country has different things and different developments, and there are different cultures and things are viewed in different ways. But the difference with this one was the corruption side of it. That was the difference for me, and that's why I felt it was important to stress it."" .Allegations of corruption, vote-swapping and links to trade deals at the highest levels of government have surrounded Qatar's winning bid to host the tournament. .However, the allegations have always been denied by organisers and remain unproven, and Qatar was cleared by Fifa several years ago. .There is also controversy about human rights issues, including the fact that same-sex relationships and the promotion of same-sex relationships are criminalised in Qatar. Women's rights are also restricted. .And there have been grave concerns about the treatment of migrant workers, with deaths on stadium building sites, although the numbers are disputed. .Meanwhile, the BBC has also been criticised in some quarters for not showing the World Cup's opening ceremony on Sunday. .But Lineker explained that this was the norm for any World Cup. .""The BBC always shows the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, they never ever show the opening ceremony of football tournaments on BBC One. It's never been a thing, and so I think that's where people have got misled on this. They're not a big thing. It's like a 15-20 minute little thing that they do in the background."" .A BBC spokesperson also confirmed this was the case. .The former England striker also said he would not have taken Qatari money to do football punditry there. .When asked about Gary Neville's decision to work for Qatari broadcaster beIN Sports, Lineker said: ""That's his personal decision. It's very easy to be judgmental... we're all so judgmental these days. I wouldn't have done it, no, and I haven't done it. .""But, you know, it's his life and he has to live it how he wants to live it and make the decisions that he wants to do."" .Neville has previously defended his work in Qatar, telling BBC Radio 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: ""I'm going over to the World Cup, I'm going to work on the tournament, I'm going to continue to highlight things I believe are wrong."" .Ros Atkins' full interview with Gary Lineker can be heard on The Media Show on Radio 4 at 16:30 GMT on Wednesday, and on BBC Sounds. .Lineker: BBC should have spoken up on Russia 2018.

78,78,22 November 2022,World Cup 2022: Wales LGBT Rainbow Wall 'disrespected' at opener," .Wales' LGBTQ+ Rainbow Wall fans were ""disrespected"" at the World Cup opener, according to the country's fan embassy. .The embassy's Paul Corkery said the hats were ""virtually thrown in the bin"", despite reassurances beforehand. .Laura McAllister, a gay woman and past Fifa Council candidate, was one of those told she had to remove the hat for the game against the USA. .Fifa - world football's governing body, which is responsible for the tournament - has been asked to comment. .The rainbow version of Welsh fan hats shows support for the LGBTQ+ community. .Mr Corkery is a volunteer with the Wales fan embassy, set up with the help of the UK government to assist fans at the World Cup. .He said there were as many as 6,000 Wales fans in the stadium - more than double the number predicted. .However, he said thousands were initially left at the gates unable to download tickets to their phones. .Mr Corkery said reassurances had been given to the fans embassy about travelling supporters, but nothing was put in writing, only the words ""everyone was welcome"". .""They took them off seven FAW staff (rainbow hats and related items) and virtually threw them in the bin - it was disrespectful,"" he said. .""They could have said 'come back and get them after' or 'put them in your bag'. They have to deal with things the right way. .""But now it's an international story. I just feel sorry for Laura, she is a friend and you could see how upset she was."" .However, Mr Corkery said he was not surprised, in light of the decision to ban alcohol from stadiums just days before the tournament started. .""They decided that in the face of a £60m Budweiser (tournament sponsorship) deal. .""They weren't afraid to do that. If they can do that, they can take a bucket hat off you,"" he added. .He believes the decision to ban alcohol at stadiums has backfired, with long queues for the Metro forming straight after the game. .Mr Corkery said thousands of fans had been stuck outside the stadium before kick off, some unable to download their tickets, while others said a special QR code disappeared from their phones. .In the end, he said many were allowed in simply by showing email confirmation. .He added: ""There were thousands of volunteers, I've never seen so many and everyone spoke English. .""They were doing their best, but didn't know the directions. .""They were sending people the wrong direction (after the game) - a mile to the Metro when it should've been 100 yards."" .Mr Corkery said a winter World Cup with Christmas approaching and the regular football season on hold felt ""alien"" to him. .However, he added: ""Looking at Canada, the USA and Mexico (joint hosts for the 2026 World Cup), there are pluses. .""There are eight stadiums here within 35 minutes. There, it will be 2,000 miles by plane."" .The embassy works with government departments to help fans - and Foreign Office officials have suggested to them there were between 5,000 and 6,000 Wales fans at Monday's game, more than double pre-match estimates of 2,500 to 3,000. .On the whole, the fan embassy volunteers said it had been a positive experience so far for most, with just one lost passport reported. .Another volunteer Kieran Jones said he knows of 12 fans who use wheelchairs and 12 with other mobility problems who have had no problems to date. .""There are so many cultures here at once,"" he said. .""On the Metro after the game last night, there were at least a dozen nationalities, all singing, trying to see who was better. .""Of course, the Welsh won."" .The third volunteer, Vince Alm added: ""For me, it's been a bit different from reading the press point of view. .""The majority of locals are very friendly, there's been no issues and not too much of a culture clash. .""They have been quite tolerant, if people have been singing, they haven't stopped them. .""If anyone has taken their shirt off, they have just asked them politely to put it back on."" .He said on the whole, fans have enjoyed themselves ""apart from the first half against the USA"". .Remove rainbow hat, ex-Wales captain told in Qatar .Wales to Qatar electric car attempt falls short .Tears and emotion as Wales return to World Cup",78

It was quite intimidating,"" Ms McAllister told BBC Breakfast. .""I'm experienced enough to cope with it but if it had been a young person, a young girl who hadn't been prepared for that, it would have been a very unpleasant and intimidating experience. .""As we were queuing to go into the stadium we'd heard that there'd been issues with some people in front of us who'd been asked to take off their hats to go into the stadium. .""So fortunately a few of us further back in the queue knew what was likely to happen,"" she said. .""And sure enough as we went through security we were told by some of the stewards that we couldn't enter the stadium wearing our rainbow hats."" .She said ""right away"" a few officials gathered round her and told her that she had to take the hat off. .""We were told it was a regulation - clearly I work in football, I work with Uefa, so I know the regulations - so I asked which regulation it applied to and we weren't told that."" .Ms McAllister said the hat was ""snuck"" into the stadium after the incident. .""I certainly wasn't going to give it up. It's an important symbol of everything that we're about in Welsh football at the moment and hopefully the wider nation. .It comes after national team captains, including Wales' Gareth Bale, were told not to wear One Love armbands. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. .""We're here to live our own values as a nation and with Wales being in the World Cup for the first time in six decades, it's important to show what our country's all about, and that is about inclusion and tolerance and diversity,"" Ms McAllister said. .The incident comes despite previous assurances that fans would be allowed to wear them. .""We need to speak for the LGBT people at home who didn't feel able to come to Doha because of the regime and its position on gay rights,"" Ms McAllister said. .""We're all horribly compromised by being here so make no mistake, so by being here we also need to make sure we don't compromise on our values."" .She stressed that Fifa had said it would allow the rainbow symbol in the stadium. .Ex-Wales footballer Laura McAllister says Qatari security asked her to remove a ""rainbow wall"" bucket cap .""It was the complete opposite of that,"" she said. ""It was contrary to everything we were being told to expect really, and that was what was so disappointing."" .""If Fifa calls for an inclusive World Cup then we need to include everyone in that,"" she added. .A group of her friends had rainbow wrist bands removed, she said, and another friend had his rainbow laces removed from his shoes. .The bucket hat has become the must-have accessory for Wales fans over the past decade. .The yellow, green and red hats are worn in their thousands by the so-called Red Wall, with a rainbow version also produced. .Tracy Brown from Rainbow Wall, Wales' LGBTQ+ supporters' group, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she was not surprised fans were asked to remove the hats. .""We were all anticipating that this would actually happen,"" she said. .""Fifa have a habit of going back on their word. That started a couple of days before with the drinking issues within stadiums."" .She said the threat of sanctions for individual players wearing OneLove arm bands, which promote diversity and inclusion, had put everyone in a ""difficult situation"". .""Obviously LGBTQ+ groups were not happy with that decision and yes, we have done a lot of work with the FAW [Football Association Wales] and will continue to do work. But now we have to work out another way to be vocal for discrimination as a whole,"" Ms Brown said. .""This is not just about the rainbow wall, this is about discrimination for everybody. This is about all of our human rights."" .Meanwhile, an American journalist, Grant Wahl, said in a Tweet he was stopped for half an hour by security for wearing a rainbow-themed t-shirt. .He was later allowed to enter the stadium perimeter, he added. .""Finally a commander came through, said I could go through, and apologised,"" he told the BBC. .Wales' Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths told the Senedd that she also knew ""somebody in Qatar last night that was asked to take their rainbow laces out of their trainers"". .Ms Griffiths was answering First Ministers Questions while Mark Drakford returns from watching the Wales-USA game. .Answering a question from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, she said the Welsh government had been ""in dialogue"" with the British embassy in Doha seeking ""urgent clarification that rainbow bucket hats or laces or T-shirts are not banned from stadia, and I very much hope we won't see a repeat of that"". .UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said he raised issues about ""being a welcoming World Cup host"" with Qatar during a visit for the start of the tournament, after reports that fans wearing rainbow clothing had faced problems. .""I've just returned from Qatar. We raised the issues of being a welcoming host nation and the Qataris are very keen to do so,"" he said. .""My duty is to make sure that the English and Welsh fans that are in Qatar to enjoy the football are able to do so: enjoy themselves, be themselves, and be safe and secure whilst they're doing it."" .Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

86,86,21 November 2022,Qatar crash death: Family says collecting evidence 'like jigsaw'," .Trying to establish how a woman died in a crash in Qatar was ""like a jigsaw"", her stepfather who worked on World Cup stadiums told an inquest in Britain. .Rafaelle Tsakanika, 21, of Cambridge, died in a hit-and-run collision near Doha on 30 March 2019. .Her stepfather Donal Sullivan said that after she did not return home they were ""pushed around from pillar to post"" by police as they tried to find her. .Coroner Simon Milburn adjourned the inquest to consider his conclusions. .Construction specialist Mr Sullivan told the hearing, in Huntingdon, in Cambridgeshire, that he had been involved in working on four or five of the new football stadiums. .He said when Ms Tsakanika, known as Raffy, did not return home that day, they ""knew something was wrong"". .After failing to get details from Qatari police, the family decided to go to a hospital where its admittance book showed ""one entry that was unknown and we felt we had to go and explore that"". .Mr Sullivan said they were ""directed to the morgue"" and there was a ""picture of Raffy's passport lying in front of us"". .He said that a worker ""gestured to one of the drawers"" and they identified Ms Tsakanika. .""This is like a jigsaw - we're piecing bits together as we go,"" Mr Sullivan told the inquest. .He said police took them to the scene of the crash, and they were shown the car that Ms Tsakanika had been in at the police compound, adding that they were not allowed to take photos. .He said they brought her body back to the UK, adding: ""At one point she was our only evidence - we didn't know what happened and we didn't trust anybody."" .In April 2019, a UK post-mortem examination found Ms Tsakanika died of traumatic head and abdominal injuries. .Ms Tsakanika's mother, Jo Sullivan, said her daughter was ""adored by everybody"". .Court documents, seen by the Press Association news agency, showed that teacher Mubarak Al Hajri, then aged 46, was convicted in Qatari courts of causing Ms Tsakanika's death, causing serious injuries to her friend, driving in a way that endangered lives, fleeing the scene of an accident, and speeding. .He was sentenced to two months in prison and ordered to pay compensation to Ms Tsakanika's family. .In witness evidence from Qatar that was read to the inquest, it was heard that Al Hajri had claimed he was driving back towards Doha and his wife ""phoned, telling me my son lacked oxygen and she didn't know how to act"". .He claimed he ""had not bumped into"" another vehicle but ""just hit the barriers"", and said he did not stop at the scene as it was the ""first accident... I feared the procedures"". .Forensic collision investigator Alex Routt had been asked by the Cambridgeshire coroner to examine the available evidence. .He told the inquest the crash was estimated to have happened at 00:10. .A speed camera clocked Al Hajri's car at 191km/h (118mph) at 00:06, and a second camera clocked it at 181km/h (112mph) six minutes later. .He said he had been told that Al Hajri's vehicle appeared damaged in the second speed camera photo, but added: ""I haven't seen those photographs and they haven't been disclosed."" .He agreed with Ms Tsakanika's family barrister's suggestion that his analysis was hindered by the lack of information from the Qatari authorities. .Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

89,89,21 November 2022,World Cup 2022: Tears and emotion as Wales return," .How Wales qualified for Qatar .It is a day of huge emotion for thousands of Wales football fans, who will experience something many feared they would never witness. .Having flown to Qatar from around the world, they will watch their side on the biggest footballing stage of them all for the first time since 1958. .Some 2,500 will be there when captain Gareth Bale's side take on the USA in their first World Cup group game. .Fans admit there will be tears when the national anthem starts to play. .The majority of Wales supporters will be watching from home, including at fans parks across the country, while some of those put off by the cost of travel to Qatar have still travelled to warmer climates. .However for one supporter, who has flown to Qatar from Australia, following Wales has meant missing his maths GCSE, running up large credit card debts, abandoning his mother in Rome and ignoring his heavily pregnant wife's pleas to go home for the birth of their first child. .Garry George fell in love with football watching Italia 90, but admits that as an eight-year-old, he did not even realise his country had a team. .He said: ""West Germany won the World Cup and I remember seeing on television about a year later, Ian Rush scoring a winner against them, being taken aback and thinking 'we actually have a team?' .""Then I thought, as we had beaten the world champions, did that make us world champions?"" .This is when the dream of seeing the side on the biggest stage began. .Garry, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, did not miss a home game for years - even when Wales played at Anfield in 1999 against Denmark, he missed his maths GCSE to travel, a decision that had repercussions when he decided to become a teacher. .He would try to attend every away game and he has fond memories of talking to players Gary Speed, Chris Coleman and Robbie Savage after matches. .These trips ended in 2009 when he emigrated to Australia, but when Wales qualified for Euro 2016, he had to be there - a move that got him in big trouble with both his mother and pregnant wife Jess. .Celebs sent messages of support to Wales at the World Cup .""I had only booked to stay (in France) for the group stages and arranged to meet my mother in Rome. But when we kept getting through (the tournament rounds), I left her there,"" he said. .""I was relieved in a way when we lost in the semis as my son was due and my wife in Australia kept ringing and saying 'you have to come home'. .""I'm glad I didn't have to make that decision of whether to stay or not if we had got to the final."" .Covid rules meant he could not be at Euro 2020. .For this tournament he has flown in with hand luggage to watch Wales play USA, and then his adopted home Australia v France the next day, before heading straight to the airport. .Geoff Edwards, 59, got strange looks when checking on to his flight. .""They couldn't seem to work out why I was travelling from an Australian airport with a New Zealand passport and wearing a Wales football hat,"" said Geoff. .Now living in Perth, he is half-Welsh, half-Kiwi, but there is no divided loyalty and he said it ""means everything"" for him and twins Rhiannon and Beth, 26. .Beth said: ""We all just had to come."" .Meanwhile, 11-year-old Kegan is one of the youngest fans to travel over and has only known the good times. .It is a different story for his dad Gavin Waite, 43, from Newport, who said: ""We have followed them through the campaign, we had to be here for this."" .Lamona Parry, 52, from Wrexham, is at the tournament with husband Ian, 59, daughter Lowri, 25 and her boyfriend Aled Bayley, 25. .They are staying on a cruise ship docked in Doha, and she said: ""We are 52 and 59, we just thought that we have to make it, as who knows when it might happen again."" .Ann and Mike Criddle, from Cardiff, said being at the tournament a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"". .Mike, 58, said: ""I watched us lose to Scotland in '77 and '84 and was on my knees in front of the television when Paul Bodin missed the penalty in 1993."" .Ann, 60, said: ""I think the Wales camp is a happy one. After doing so well in the Euros, they know they have the potential to do the same here."" .A lot has changed since Wales last qualified for the World Cup finals. .It was a year before the current version of the national flag was adopted and almost two decades before Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau was routinely played before kick-off, while Dafydd Iwan - the writer of Wales tournament anthem Yma o Hyd - was still in school. .It was also a world without Sir Tom Jones - the tournament taking place a full five years before Thomas Woodward emerged from Treforest as the seemingly ageless star. .But for 64-year-old Richard Rees, most significantly, it was three months before he was born. .""I was at Anfield in 1977 when we lost to Scotland, 1985 in Ninian Park, Paul Bodin's penalty in 1993, Russia in 2003. So many disappointments,"" he said. .""I thought I'd never see it and sobbed fully for five minutes after the anthem in Bordeaux (when Wales appeared at Euro 2016). .""The World Cup will be even more emotional. It's a day I thought I'd never see."" .Richard, from Radyr, Cardiff, shares a special bond with Tony Munday, 59, who emigrated to Perth, Australia, in 2000. .As well as both being accountants and huge football fans, they are married to sisters: very understanding ones, Tony jokes. .The pair travelled 3,000 miles (4,828 km) between Cardiff and France as Wales kept progressing at Euro 2016. .Mr Munday said: ""They have only got good since I left Wales, but I have followed from afar and had to come."" .He flew in from Perth to meet his brother-in-law - a distance of 5,813 miles (9,355km), while Martyn Kay, 39, travelled 3,926 miles (6,319km) from Hong Kong. .It will be his 40th birthday on 4 December and he is hoping to see Wales in the last 16 on that day. .Originally from Caerleon, Newport, the engineer said: ""I had to come. It's been 64 years since we were last here [at the World Cup] - who knows how long it will be until next time? .""I'm nearly 40 now, maybe I won't be here next time, so it really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."" .Nia Davies, 43, from Bridgend, and Sarah Jones, 43, from Newport, regularly follow Wales around the world. .""Wales are going to win obviously,"" said Sarah. .'Drink the blood of your enemies, boys' Video, 00:00:49

90,90,21 November 2022,World Cup: A quick guide to the Qatar 2022 tournament," .The World Cup is back - and football mania is about to kick off around the world. If you're not a football fan but you want to be a part of it, here's what you need to know. .Thirty-two teams from around the world take part, and millions of fans watch the matches. More than one million people are expected to travel from their home countries to see the games in person. .The World Cup kicks off with a ""group stage"" - where teams are put into groups of four and spend two weeks trying to win enough points to get into the finals. If they do, they enter the knockout stage where you have to win to stay in - this is where dramatic penalty shoot-outs happen because there has to be a winner. .The World Cup is usually held during the northern hemisphere's summer. But it's so hot in Qatar that it can reach up to 50C in June and July - so they moved it to November and December. .Qatar is the first Arab nation to host the tournament, but it follows strict Muslim laws and same-sex relationships are banned. The country has also been criticised for its human rights record and the treatment of foreign workers who helped to build new stadiums, roads and hotels for the tournament. .The country has insisted no-one will be discriminated against. But its chief World Cup organiser, Nasser al Khater, says the government won't change its laws and has asked visitors to respect the country's culture. .England's Harry Kane, along with other European team captains, had planned to wear ""OneLove"" armbands promoting diversity and inclusion - but this plan was abandoned when Fifa threatened to give players yellow cards. Denmark have altered their shirts and Australia made a video urging Qatar to change its laws on homosexuality. England players also met some migrant workers in Qatar ahead of the tournament starting. .In the UK, the BBC and ITV will both be showing matches, and Welsh-language channel S4C says it plans to show every Wales game.

My small country is now the centre of the world,"" Naji Rashed Al Naimi tells me. .He's the head of The Qatari Dama club at the market, a traditional game similar to chess. We sit in the Majlis - a traditional sitting room - with his friends all gathered around the TV. .""We've been through so much to get here. So many difficulties and challenges,"" Mr Al Naimi tells me. .He and his friends are keen to tell us about the symbolism of the ceremony - the history of Qatar and how far the Gulf state has come from the old days in the desert, to hosting the World Cup. .The crowd in the sitting area applaud as the Emir Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, and his father, the former Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, arrive. An archive video shows the young former leader playing football in the desert. .So far though, controversy has overshadowed the football. .The latest was the last-minute ban on beer sales in stadiums only two days before the start of the tournament. .There have also been fears over how LGBT fans can expect to be treated given the country's strict adherence to Sharia law - homosexuality is illegal in Qatar - as well as the treatment of migrant workers. .But you wouldn't know this was one of the most contentious and debated World Cups - sitting among this group of Qatari men. .""This was a dream, now you can see it in front of you. I'm so proud,"" Salem Hassan Al Mohanadi tells me. ""All those who criticised us... we said nothing.

93,93,20 November 2022,World Cup 2022: Welsh ex-pats welcome football fans," .About 1,200 Wales fans have flown to Qatar from Cardiff on Sunday, the eve of their nation's first appearance at the World Cup finals in 64 years. .The five flights left a chilly Welsh November for temperatures of 30C (86F). .But while the weather may be alien, they will find familiarity, according to ex-pats who have made their home in the Middle East state. .In total, more than 2,500 Wales fans are expected to be at Monday's opening match against the USA. .Those not flying from Cardiff are arriving from other airports over the weekend or basing themselves in Dubai. .They will be welcomed by hundreds of ex-pats, many of them as passionately loyal to their adopted country as they are to their homeland in the face of criticism of the host nation in the lead-up to the tournament. .At Cardiff Airport excited fans swarmed about in red tops and bucket hats, with chants and good-natured banter filling the air. .Lauren McNie, flying out with her sister Kerrin, said: ""I didn't sleep much last night, I just want to get out there now. .""We've got conditional tickets to the final, so we are fairly optimistic."" .Gareth O'Shea, travelling with his sons Rhys and Morgan, said: ""I'm excited to be here, that's the main thing. .""It's been a long time coming, it was a hard qualifying campaign but we are here. .""I recognise there are issues with the country but we'll go, we'll make the most of it and we'll spread the message from our part of the world."" .His son Rhys said: ""We're not just here to take part. We are gonna try and win it, aren't we?"" .Morgan said: ""Anything can happen. It's the World Cup, isn't it?"" .Also in the departure lounge was Isaac: ""It's crazy, I can't believe Wales are at the World Cup, I'm so excited,"" he said. .""I reckon we'll get out of the group. I don't think there is anyone in the group we should fear. .""Everyone says England, but they are rubbish. You saw them in the Nations League? They could pick up barely any points. .""I don't think we should be afraid of them at all."" .With less than 15% of the three million population born in Qatar, the ex-pats describe it as a cosmopolitan place they have watched grow and change. .The price and availability of alcohol has been much publicised but the experiences of sports teacher Callan Bowden might help allay many fears. .""I have been here eight years. I didn't know what to expect at first, but I was out four times in my first week,"" he said. .He suggested that anyone who is more adventurous can explore the desert, but those that want to drink will be able to find somewhere. .With lots of offers on, such as two-for-one and 50% discounts, he said it can be cheaper than London, or even his home city of Cardiff, if people look around. .A stadium alcohol ban was announced just two days before the start of the tournament, but he believes this could potentially cause more of a headache for organisers than fans. .""It may spoil the experience for some, but beer will still be easy enough to get around other places,"" he added. .""It may cause more of a rush to get out to the stadium, with fans staying in the fan zones and pubs longer. It could spell trouble with them getting into the stadium late."" .While Callan is looking forward to meeting other Wales supporters, he encountered what he described as ""rent-a-fans"" when trying to catch a glimpse of the national team arriving last week. .The tournament's supreme organising committee has denied using flag-waving welcoming parties for sides, but he said: ""About six of us went to watch the team arrive at about 3am, and we noticed a group of fans with Welsh flags a lot closer than us that we weren't allowed to get near to. .""At the end, they got into an Uber and told me they were volunteers. It was annoying as there was only six of us, so they could have let us get a bit closer."" .While World Cup banners, giant posters and neon signs now dominate the capital, the build-up has been a long one. .Pam Pearce, 59, from Wrexham, was in the venue 12 years ago where it was announced Qatar had been successful in its bid to host the tournament. .""We've seen it all come together. There's been a lot of negativity globally but this is a wonderful place. I wouldn't have stayed here 12 years otherwise,"" she said. .While much has been made about the price of alcohol, she points out many things will be free for visitors - including public transport, entry to souks and a new beach that's been created. .Her daughter Kathryn Witchalls, 36, sees other benefits for fans, adding: ""There are so many concerts happening. I have Robbie Williams tickets. You wouldn't be able to get them if he was performing back home."" .Pam's husband Jonathan said it was right to focus on the various issues and change the country for the better, but argued that criticism of Qatar is also criticism of the millions from around the world who have made their home here, including a large number from the UK. .""We celebrated with the country, the residents and Qataris when it (the World Cup) was awarded. We are part of it,"" he added. .Garin Rees, 31, also admitted there was work to do overall, but added: ""I think Welsh people will find a lot to connect with Qataris over. .""The food: lamb is important in both places, it's a small country just like Wales, Welsh people are known for being friendly and Qataris are incredibly so."" .Garin left Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in 2017 in search of adventure and to see the world, and met his wife Ayesha, 31, whom he works with at an international school. .The couple have been teaching their pupils about Wales, and aspects of the culture have struck a chord - especially the mythical beast with which the country is associated. .""We had biscuits with the flags of the competing nations on them and they were all saying 'I want Wales',"" added Ayesha. .""The dragon and flag are so prominent and distinctive, it sticks out and the children have all been so excited about seeing it around Doha."" .Mike Murphy, 62, from Bridgend, lived in Qatar 15 years ago and after leaving, returned two years ago, saying: ""Souk Waqif (a traditional market where fans will congregate) didn't exist. .""It was very old and going to be knocked down before they decided at the last minute it was a nice place to renovate. .""The roads were also a mess back then."" .He said the place had been transformed and thinks fans will have a fantastic experience, adding: ""There's been all sorts of stupid rumours: someone said we aren't allowed to wear shorts. .""Most of us obviously didn't get the memo."" .Celebrations as Wales end 64-year World Cup wait .Land of Song heard loudly from the football stands .World Cup revives folk song turned football anthem .Wales to Qatar electric car attempt falls short",93

Originally from Malaysia, they now live in Cardiff. .""I'm definitely not going to watch the World Cup - back in Malaysia, I usually do watch it with my family and friends because football is a big thing,"" said Jia Wei. .""If Fifa could choose another country which is more LGBT friendly, then I definitely would watch it. .""If the ambassadors are there doing basically what the Qatari officials want them to do, then the event will not really make a difference, and it will also be detrimental for the LGBTQ+ community. .""Silence can be deafening, imagine if there are many countries boycotting the tournament. .""In Paris, they're not having fan areas anymore, in Germany, they're putting up ""Boycott Qatar"" banners. .""People who are watching, look at the teams and see what they are doing to gently protest against this, and if you are going to Qatar, try to look out for the local people, and use your voice in a privileged position to help the LGBT Qatari's."" .James Brinning is a 29-year-old gay man from Cardiff. .""I am going to watch it,"" he said. .""Obviously, the moment we qualified against Ukraine, I remember being there and thinking this is the best thing that I'm ever going to see as a Welsh fan. .""Then it kind of all dawned on me on the way out of the stadium. I thought, 'oh am I going to be able to go'. .""I was proper conflicted thinking about would I be able to go, would I want to go? .""It's proper mixed feelings for Welsh people, because we've had to wait so long since we were last at one. .""When I was deciding whether I wanted to go or not, I was consumed in thinking about my own personal safety. .""Then I realised that's probably the complete wrong argument, because it should be about the LGBT people who live their daily life, who are going to get a two or three-week break from their repression and being attacked by the authorities, and as soon as this World Cup finishes, the spotlight will turn back on them. .""But the one good thing that has come out of this is that footballers and teams have realised they have a profile and a voice, after the Euros and the racism, the England team were really good at speaking out about it, and hopefully that can instil a culture change. .""If [Wales] were likely to be at more World Cup's, then I'd be more keen on fully boycotting this one."" .Sam Ledgerwood is a 31-year-old gay man, and lives in Neath. .""Football has been a massive part of my life, even being an LGBTQ+ person, there are definitely issues there, but I can't see myself not watching it,"" said Sam. .""I'm definitely going to be watching it. .""There's definitely a bit of conflict there, but it's been a part of my life since I was five years old so it's really hard to juggle the two. .""As LGBTQ+ football fans, saying I'm not going to watch or be visible at the World Cup is worse than going there, and saying we are here, we are people, and be visible there. .""But as it has got nearer I do feel conflicted about it, I was adamant and didn't think twice, but as more things have come out with the Qatari ambassador, as well as the migrant workers and infrastructure issues and LGBT issues, it's taken the excitement away. .""I am still going to watch it but it will be conflicting to watch."" .Simon Emmanuel is a 37-year-old straight man from Swansea and an ally to the LGBTQ+ community. .""Wales have been rubbish for a long time, and I don't think I'm going to get this opportunity again in my life time,"" Simon tells the BBC. .""What's been good about this whole fiasco though is the light that's been shone on the issues that I didn't know too much about before. .""It's a bigger issue than football, I don't think by boycotting the World Cup it's going to change the majority of the issues that are going on out there. .""Also, the World Cup has been in places where it probably shouldn't have been previously. .""People will argue amongst themselves about whether they're going to watch it, but the bigger issue is on governments and what they're going to do about it. .""I've been undecided for a long time. .""The World Cup in general is a good thing, it brings out a lot of positives and a lot of love in people, but why have it in a place where it's a disastrous place to be? .""It's just a tainted World Cup."" .Being an LGBT football fan from the Middle East .'I don't want to worry about being killed' .Football fan boycotts first World Cup in 32 years .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup .LGBT Wales fans pledge boycott of Qatar World Cup",97

20 November 2022",World Cup 2022: How Qatar built a team 'ready to dazzle the world'," .Qatar have big ambitions for this year's World Cup - not just in terms of hosting it successfully but also regarding how far their national team can progress. .This will be their first appearance in the tournament, having qualified by virtue of being hosts, and getting through the group stage is their minimal target. .That may seem a lofty ambition for a country with relatively little football history and a population of Qatari nationals smaller than Leicester. .But they are no pushovers. They are the Asian champions and have spent at least a generation building for this moment, so how have Qatar created a football team they believe is capable of surprising the world and advancing to the knockout stages? .Qatar being awarded the World Cup in 2010 understandably raised eyebrows, not only from an ethical point of view but also from a football one, with the country having only a short football heritage. .They did not play their first official match until 1970, when they lost 2-1 to neighbours Bahrain, and have a small pool of players - the country has a population of 2.9 million but only around 300,000 of those are Qataris. .""Qatar has a strict requirement that even if you are born in the country but your parents aren't Qatari you have no rights to citizenship,"" John McManus, social anthropologist and author of Inside Qatar, told BBC Sport. .""Part of the reason for that is in order to keep the benefits that come with citizenship so generous - the 11% of Qatar nationals get free education, a well-paid job and lots of other big perks. More people getting citizenship would mean that would have to be spread out more."" .Despite the challenges of a limited number of players being available to them, they did produce some notable results over the next few decades. .Qatar reached the final of the 1981 Youth World Championship in Australia, beating Brazil and England along the way, and in the early 1990s they got to the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Olympics before winning the Gulf Cup. .But the drive to really improve the national team so that it could be more competitive globally accelerated at the turn of the century. .Having enjoyed some good results under Brazilian coaches in the previous decades - their Olympics and Gulf Cup success came under Sebastiao Lapola - Qatar looked to see if they could add some South American flair to their playing squad. .Despite their own naturalisation rules being stringent, in 2004 Qatar tried to secure the services of uncapped Brazilian trio Ailton, Dede and Leandro, who were significant players in the German Bundesliga at the time. .The trio had no prior ties to Qatar but the attempt to naturalise them was ultimately blocked by Fifa, who then tightened regulations so that players had to show a ""clear connection"" to those they were hoping to represent, which included spending a set amount of time in the country before they could be naturalised. .""Fifa toughened the rules up based on what Qatar tried to do and they made it more difficult to import talent,"" added McManus. .""They changed tack and focused on developing what they have got."" .Qatar did still try and naturalise talent in line with the new regulations - Uruguayan Sebastian Soria was invited to play in the Qatari League 2004 and two years later he met the eligibility criteria to be naturalised, and a number of other players from overseas followed similar paths, but a lot of focus was placed on the longer term and the country's ability to develop their own players. .Eighteen years ago the £1bn Aspire Academy was founded with the aim of finding and nurturing the best talent both in football and in other sports - Mutaz Essa Barshim, who won high jump gold at the Tokyo Olympics last year, graduated from it. .In football, the academy scouts 5,000 11-year-olds in Qatar annually, with the most promising talent given a grant and then spending the next seven years being coached, alongside receiving an education. .The academy utilises coaches who have been influenced by the best in Europe. Felix Sanchez was a youth coach at Barcelona's famed La Masia academy. .He was employed by Aspire in 2006, and moved through the age groups with the same players, going on to manage Qatar's Under-19s, U23s and now the senior team. .""Aspire has an important and critical role in Qatar sports,"" former Qatar goalkeeper Ahmad Khalil, who starred for the national team when they won the 1992 Gulf Cup, told BBC Sport. .""The players of the national team began as young players with Sanchez in Aspire and they moved with him to the national team when he became Qatar coach."" .That continuity and familiarity between coach and players has clearly been important. .In 2014, Qatar - coached by Sanchez - won the AFC U19 Championship with a team comprised of players from the Aspire Academy. Five years later, several of those players and coach Sanchez were part of the side that beat Japan to win the 2019 Asian Cup. .""We all came up together with the same coach,"" said Qatar midfielder Assim Madibo at last year's Concacaf Gold Cup, a tournament the national team had been invited to and where they reached the semi-finals, losing to the United States. .""I'm with this culture from 11 or 12 years old now, so to make it here to the top it's a big thing for us."" .USA coach Gregg Berhalter, who had previously visited the Aspire Academy, said: ""Having had an inside look on what they do, they almost operate like a club team. .""After their club team games, they all meet up together and do regeneration at the facility there. They get to spend time with each other, look at the games, analyse it. .""It's a really unique model and I'm excited to see how they play in the World Cup because they really have a blueprint for how to prepare."" .It is all well and good having a team grow together, but the locally developed players also needed to be exposed to quality opponents on a regular basis, and Qatari football having significant wealth to draw from has helped with that. .Since the early 2000s, Marcel Desailly, Pep Guardiola, Xavi Hernandez and James Rodriguez have all been tempted over to play in the Qatar Stars League. .Facing such opposition was not only beneficial for the local players but also boosted the profile of the league, making it more attractive for higher calibre footballers. .Qatar's players have grown together and won together. The foundations put in place almost two decades ago have the team on the right path as they now head into the World Cup as Asian champions and 50th in the Fifa rankings. .""Yes it has involved a lot of money but they still had to make it happen,"" added McManus. ""They stopped looking for quick fixes and are seeing the results of that now."" .Khalil added: ""After winning the Asian Cup, the aim is for our performances to improve and develop even further. It is quite a tough group but everything is possible for us to progress to the next round. .""Football is filled with surprises and we hope we can surprise. I expect the Qatar national team to dazzle the world."" .Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-link .Get your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC Sounds",98

And that's when my hell started. And my family's."" .Mr Glendinning faced the threat of years in prison. .In 2017 Mr Glendinning was sentenced in his absence to two years in prison for defaulting on a debt. .He had agreed to take out a £20,000 loan with his bank in Qatar while working in Doha in 2016, but was not able to keep up full repayments when he lost his job. .His family told how he was made redundant in 2017, while on sick leave at home in Scotland, but had kept in touch with the bank, not realising he had been convicted of a crime. .He only discovered the arrest warrant meant he was on an Interpol red list when he was detained at Basra airport in September. .His brother sold his car to help pay his brother's legal bills, which within four weeks of his arrest had soared to £30,000. .Mr Glendinning will return to Kincardine to recover from his ordeal and his family say he will never work abroad again. .Radha Stirling said: ""This is the moment we have been working towards the past five weeks and we're incredibly relieved to see him back on UK soil. .""Brian is going to take some time to rest and recuperate with his family before telling the world about the horrific experience he was forced to endure at the hands of Qatar, a country which has spent a fortune portraying itself as a tolerant society. .""Once Brian has rested, we intend to push for British safeguards and to hold Qatar to account for the repeated abuse of our citizens"". .Scot freed in Iraq after Qatari conviction arrest .Scot held in Iraq over unknown Qatari conviction .Scot held in Greek jail over joke gift to fly home .'He's no Pablo Escobar, just a guy from Tranent'",103
104,10,19 November 2022,World Cup stadium alcohol ban emblematic of contradictions," .The last-minute alcohol ban for stadiums, announced by Fifa on Friday, is emblematic of the contradictions at the heart of this World Cup. .Qatar is trying to strike a balance between delivering a successful tournament that is enjoyable for the fans, and reassuring its Muslim population they have not compromised on religious rules and practices. .But the last-minute reversal has caused confusion and concern. It also raised questions about the timing of the decision - and what else might change. .When Qatar bid to host the World Cup, it knew - as did the rest of the world - that it was an unlikely candidate. .And, as a small, very rich Muslim nation with a strict way of living - and big ambitions to be a serious broker in the sporting world - it has a lot to prove. .But controversial and expensive as it all was, building the stadiums could have been the more straightforward part - compared to getting the fans safely to and from the venues, while ensuring they enjoy the football and the culture. .""I'm actually worried,"" a friend in Qatar told me. ""We haven't had anything like this before. Not that many people. All here at once going to the venues. I worry what that will be like."" .If you're a football supporter who has travelled to Doha at great expense, you'd be forgiven for not knowing exactly what to expect. It's a different picture for Qatari citizens, who feel a national sense of pride at hosting the World Cup. .This alcohol sale ban will be seen as the leadership staying true to the Muslim rules that the vast majority here abide by. .But there are also questions about why Fifa was unable to demand that Qatar stick to the plan, and about consistency. For the 2014 World Cup, Fifa made Brazil change its laws on the sale of alcohol at matches. .Drinking is not the main reason fans have travelled here - but it is part of the football culture for many. .It's also symbolic of the fine line Qatar is walking: presenting itself on one of the world's biggest of stages as an outward-facing, welcoming country while maintaining its cultural, religious and conservative integrity. .Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Williams, Gabby Logan & Jermaine Jenas give World Cup predictions .Alcohol sales banned at World Cup stadiums in Qatar",104
105,11,18 November 2022,World Cup 2022: Wales-Qatar electric car bid falls short," .France, Germany and Italy proved relatively easy as one Welsh team progressed well on its journey to the Qatar World Cup. .Serbia and North Macedonia were more challenging, but the team made it to the final leg in Saudi Arabia. .The aim had been to get through 18 countries to Qatar in an electric car - but after successfully driving through 17, the dream ended at the border of the tournament host's neighbour. .But there can be glorious defeat. .Instead of driving into Doha ahead of Wales' first game against the USA on Monday, they flew in with a trophy - the car's wheel trim to hand to the players, as well as hundreds of messages of support from back home. .""The most emotional, toughest part was being at the Saudi border [with Jordan],"" said former Cardiff City player Scott Young. .""We got to passport control, got them stamped, got back into the car, drove to the next station and realised it wasn't going to happen. We begun moving back and were stuck in no man's land between two countries for eight hours."" .They had feared a lack of electric car charging points in countries such as North Macedonia and Serbia would be sticking points - but in the end it was the law in Saudi Arabia that was their undoing, with right-hand drive cars not allowed in. .""We waited two or three days, trying to find the solution or the correct permission,"" said Nick Smith. .""But none exist. Electric cars are apparently something they are looking to spend a lot of money on, that wasn't the problem. Someone said the problem with right hand drive cars is people bringing them in and undercutting the [local] market."" .Despite their journey ending in Jordan, the group were some of the first Wales fans to arrive in Doha - but instead of realising their dream by arriving in an electric car, named Morris, they flew in on Thursday. .They didn't quite complete the 5,000-mile (8,000km) journey by car, but hope that at least being in Qatar with about 2,500 other spectators will inspire the players. .The national squad had been engaged from the start, although Gareth Bale and the players were not confident of seeing them in the Middle East when the group set off from their Vale of Glamorgan training base on 28 November. .Fellow fans Huw Talfryn Walters and Walter Pennell joined Mr Smith and Mr Young, with Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy relatively easily passed. .Even so, the stars were still not convinced they would be successful, including two former internationals who joined them between Switzerland and Austria. .As they left the group, Danny Gabbidon asked if he thought they would see them in Qatar, to which Joe Ledley joked: ""No chance."" .Things did get tougher, with a 14-hour drive from Belgrade to Greece. .""The challenges finding chargers through Serbia and North Macedonia were massive - in the end, we did find them, but arrived after midnight with five hours sleep,"" Mr Pennell said. .If the Welsh weather finally caught up with them in Athens, inspiration arrived in the form of Chris Coleman, the man who led Wales to the semi finals of Euro 2016. .He currently manages Atromitos in Greece, and they watched the side in action before saying goodbye to Morris for what they hoped would be the first and only time on the journey. .It was shipped to Israel, with the group flying in to Tel Aviv, and they described hearing ships being unloaded in the port of Haifa from their hotel rooms and keeping their ""fingers crossed that the gods of customs paper work are on our side and we'll soon be on our way"". .Luckily, the car arrived and the team spent time taking in the sights of Petra in Jordan before heading towards Saudi Arabia. .But after 18 days across 17 countries and 3,800 miles, they suddenly hit a brick wall and were left with two options. .They could drive back to Israel and get a ferry around the middle east to Qatar - but that is a two-week journey which would have meant missing Wales' first match. .""It would also have meant going through Syria, Iraq and Iran, and we didn't really want to do that,"" added Mr Smith. .After three days in Jordan, they decided to fly in to Doha, with it unclear what the future holds for Morris. .""We left him in a car show room in Jordan. We are not sure yet if we are going to ship him back or drive him,"" Mr Smith said. .It was an epic journey that brought support from thousands of well-wishers back home, with some legends of Welsh football involved along the way. .One of these was Peter Nicholas, who won 73 caps for Wales and described the border issues as having ""one foot in the sea and having to go back again"". .He joined them in Amman, Jordan, and met the Wales team with the group on Friday, adding: ""They were all so interested about the trip and asked great questions. We just told them to go and do Wales proud and I'm sure they will."" .While Morris didn't quite make it to Qatar, his crew got there to cheer on Wales and there is still a lot of glory in falling at the final hurdle. .If the national side's journey ends with defeat in the World Cup final, few will complain. .Wales fans driving to World Cup in electric car .Wales squad arrive in Qatar for World Cup",105
106,12,18 November 2022,World Cup 2022: Wales fans' anger at Qatar alcohol ban," .Wales fans have voiced anger and disappointment at the last-minute ban on alcohol in Qatar World Cup stadiums. .Some are worried about how fans will react if the authorities make other late changes, and they fear it could even encourage pre-game binge drinking. .Alcohol was to be served in venues despite its sale being controlled in the Muslim country. .But Fifa changed its policy two days before the tournament's start, and three days before Wales' first game. .The decision followed what football's governing body called ""discussions"" with the authorities in Qatar. .However, fans in corporate areas will still be able to buy alcohol. .Lauren McNie, from Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is worried the ban might actually encourage drunkenness. .""There has been a lot of talk about the cultural differences and so I'm not surprised,"" she said. .""It's pretty last-minute - just 48 hours before the kick-off in the first match. To change it this late in the day it is disappointing. .""I'm concerned that some people might be tempted to binge drink before a match."" .Even though she is not a big drinker, she said it was still ""nice to have a drink or two"". .""For me, football isn't about drinking. I want to remember it!"" she said. ""I like to sit down and watch a match with a clear head."" .Wales will play their first game against the USA on Monday. .Paul Corkery, from Football Supporters Association Cymru, said he was concerned about ""the unknown"" way football fans from 32 nations may react to Qatari police and stewards if other elements of their footballing enjoyment are stopped. .He told BBC Radio Wales Drive: ""Having a drink right outside the ground just before kick-off isn't a big deal, really. It's the fact that they've changed it. .""Any other guarantee becomes null and void then as far as I'm concerned because the fans have lost trust, because they were guaranteed something and now they're not. .""They might change the rules on the policing as well. Simple things like somebody holding hands, maybe. Have they changed their policy on that? .""The police officer on the street is a guy who's going to be dealing with the fans and we're totally reliant on them. Entrance to the stadium with flags: if they say 'no', it's no. Simple. .""It doesn't matter what the bosses have said. It's the guy in the street that the fans have got to deal with, is the issue, and that's the only thing I'm worried about. .""They're football fans, the same as us.

That will still be on sale in the eight venues. .Budweiser owner AB InBev said the circumstances were ""beyond our control"". .The Football Supporters' Association, which represents Wales and England fans, criticised the timing of the ban. .""Some fans like a beer at a game and some don't, but the real issue is the last minute U-turn which speaks to a wider problem - the total lack of communication and clarity from the organising committee towards supporters,"" a spokesman said. .""If they can change their minds on this at a moment's notice, with no explanation, supporters will have understandable concerns about whether they will fulfil other promises relating to accommodation, transport or cultural issues."" .William will cheer Wales and England at World Cup .Schoolchildren give Wales big World Cup send-off .World Cup 'chance to show Wales is distinct nation'",106

It said football should not be ""dragged"" into ideological or political ""battles"". .In response, 10 European football associations - including those of England and Wales - said ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"". .England captain Harry Kane and the captains of the other nine teams involved will wear ""One Love"" armbands to show support for LGBTQ+ people. .An estimated 30,000 workers from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Philippines built facilities for the World Cup finals - including new stadiums, hotels and roads. .In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 workers had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid, using data supplied by embassies in Qatar. .However, the Qatar government said the total was misleading as it counted many foreign workers who had lived in Qatar for a long time and had not worked on World Cup projects. .Qatar's official records show that between 2014 and 2020, there were 37 deaths among labourers at World Cup stadium construction sites, only three of which were ""work-related"". .However, the International Labour Organisation says this is an underestimate. It says Qatar doesn't count deaths from heart attacks and respiratory failure as work-related - even though these are often caused from working in high temperatures. .It estimates that 50 foreign labourers died and more than 500 others were seriously injured in Qatar in 2021 alone, and another 37,600 suffered mild to moderate injuries. .Qatar announced two days before the tournament that it will not allow sales of beer at World Cup stadiums. .Now, alcohol will only be available in designated fan zones and the bars of luxury hotels. It will cost between £10 and £12 a can, or pint. .There will also be areas where drunken fans will have to go, to sober up. .Non-alcoholic beer will still be sold at the stadiums. .In 2010, Qatar clinched the rights to the World Cup after winning a ballot of Fifa's 22 executive members, beating bids from the US, South Korea, Japan and Australia. .It is the first Arab nation to host the tournament. .Qatar was accused of paying Fifa officials £3m ($3.7m) in bribes to secure their backing, but was cleared after a two-year investigation. .At the time, Fifa's then-chairman, Sepp Blatter, supported the bid, but now says it was a ""mistake"" to award the World Cup to Qatar. .There are eight stadiums, seven of which were built for the tournament. .Some 100 new hotels have also been built, as well as a new metro system, new roads, and an extension to Hamad airport. .Qatar has also built an entire new city around the Lusail stadium, in which the final match will be played. .During the months of November and December, the temperature in Qatar is usually around 25C (77F). .Had the World Cup finals been held in June and July, as they usually are, matches would have been played in temperatures exceeding 40C, and possibly reaching 50C. .Qatar initially proposed hosting the finals during the summer in air-conditioned, enclosed stadiums, but the plan was rejected.",107

18 November 2022",World Cup 2022: What can England and Wales fans expect in Qatar?," .Qatar is poised to host the first World Cup in the Middle East in the tournament's 92-year-history and the first during the Northern Hemisphere winter. .Almost all of the three million tickets available have been sold with the country expecting 1.2 million visitors for the tournament, which takes place from 20 November to 18 December. .Qatar is the smallest host nation in World Cup history, with a population of around three million living in an area approximately half the size of Wales. .It will be a compact event with the eight stadiums separated by roughly an hour's drive and 43 miles at most, with 110 metro trains and 4,000 buses to ferry fans around. .It will be a different World Cup in many ways, so what can supporters expect? .About 3,000 to 4,000 England fans are expected to travel to Qatar for the group stages, with numbers set to increase should Gareth Southgate's side reach the knockout stages. .An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 supporters will fly out to follow Wales, who are playing in their first World Cup since 1958. .Ashley Brown, the Football Supporters' Association head of supporter engagement, says the ""big unknown"" is the number of British expats, with ""more than 20,000 British passport holders in Qatar and probably over 100,000 overall in the region"". .Brown says England fans are not travelling in the same numbers as previous tournaments because of the costs involved, while the timing of the World Cup - outside of the usual summer school holidays - will ""impact the ability of families to attend"". .""For a lot of people Qatar doesn't sound like an exciting place to go, it's not a typical holiday destination, lack of alcohol availability, cost of getting there, cost when you're there, it's put a lot of people off,"" added Brown. ""The cost of living absolutely plays a part in that."" .Paul Corkrey, of the Football Supporters' Association Cymru added: ""We took 50,000 to the 2016 Euros in France so the response has been muted mainly because of the location and time of year it is being played."" .Tournament organiser Fifa has issued a top-10 list of ticket sales by country of buyers, with Qatar on top and England fourth. .It has not released a breakdown of figures by nation, or how many have been allocated to sponsors or local residents. .Apartments, hotel rooms, desert camping, villas, fan villages - and even cabins on moored cruise ships have been made available. .But some fans have complained of limited and expensive accommodation options. .Organisers are making 30,000 extra rooms available, which they say is the equivalent of one million nights and will help provide 130,000 rooms in all, including 9,000 beds in fans villages - big tents and metal cabins - 60,000 rooms in apartments and villas, 50,000 in hotels and 4,000 rooms in two cruise ships which will remain docked for the tournament. .However, it remains unclear whether that will be enough to meet demand. .The refabricated cabins at so-called fan villages built in the desert on the outskirts of Doha have attracted media attention and are being sold as a budget option. They are priced at $207 (£184) per night for two people. .Qatar's official website says rooms on the MSC Poesia cruise ship cost from $179 (£160) per night, but for many dates, the price of a room with a double bed is from around $450 (£404) a night. .Brown said many fans had been ""priced out"", with a trip covering England or Wales' three group games, factoring in travel, accommodation and tickets, likely to cost fans £3,000 at a conservative estimate. Following either side into the latter stages of the tournament would ""easily be £5,000"", added Brown. .The cheapest group stage tickets for non-Qatari residents were about £60, with prices for the final from £500. .A five-a-side event for supporters from the 32 competing nations will mirror the tournament. The Fans' Cup will be contested over four days during the competition. .Fans have been told they must have a Hayya Card (a form of fan ID which will also secure free public transport) to enter Qatar and accommodation arranged before travelling out for those intending to stay. .Rules requiring visitors to give proof of a negative Covid-19 result and to register for the country's Ehteraz contract-tracing app look set to be dropped for the World Cup, but fans are advised to check beforehand. .The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office has issued tips to supporters,external-link which include the following warnings: .World Cup chief operating officer Colin Smith said: ""All we ask, like any country, is people respect the cultural norms of Qatar."" .A stadium code of conduct is in place for spectators attending games that prohibits flags or banners exceeding two metres by 1.5 metres, and any material of a ""political, offensive and/or discriminatory nature"". .UK police officers deployed in Qatar for the World Cup will act as ""cultural interpreters"" between fans and local law enforcement to try and prevent ""unfortunate misunderstandings"" where British football 'fan culture' may need to be ""moderated"" to respect local conservative values and traditions. .Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the national lead on football policing, said British police are not there to tell fans how to behave, but would act as a ""buffer"" between supporters and Qatari law enforcement, which includes 3,000 Turkish riot police. .Fans had also been encouraged by the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Alicia Kearns, to leave their personal phones at home and take 'burner' (disposable) phones instead to Qatar. This comes amid fears that apps you have to download in Qatar are being used to hack into people's phones. .However, Chief Constable Roberts and the FSA's Brown both played down that concern and suggested fans stick to the official government's foreign commonwealth office advice. .People from 90 different countries work and live in Qatar with locals dressed in traditional thobes and abayas, while organisers say you are just as likely to see someone in a sari as you are in a football shirt or hijab. .Tourists have been told they are free to embrace their clothing of comfort, as long as it is modest and respectful to the culture. .They are expected to wear conservative attire in some places such as government buildings, national museums and Doha's renowned Souq Waqif marketplace. If someone is wearing shorts or beach attire at such places, it is likely they will be asked to cover up. .Homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar and the UK's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was criticised for suggesting that LGBT football fans heading to the World Cup should show ""a little bit of flex and compromise"". .Public displays of affection can be considered offensive, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or intent. .While Brown said he expected England and Wales fans to be ""very safe"" in Qatar in general due to very low levels of crime, he acknowledged that LGBT fans didn't ""feel safe"" enough to travel. .""It's very sad,"" said Brown. ""Three Lions Pride who represent that community as travelling England fans - I don't think any are going. .""They don't feel safe, they don't feel comfortable and they don't feel reassured and that is incredibly disappointing that Fifa can put a tournament in a country that won't welcome those people. .""Qatar is keen for this to go well. It's on the world stage, they want to be seen as a good country so I think things would be OK but it has to be their choice."" .Fifa chief Gianni Infantino has promised the best World Cup ever and said: ""Everyone will be welcome to the tournament regardless of their origin, religion, background, gender, sexual orientation or nationality."" .There will be no restrictions on non-married friends or couples staying in the same room. .Fifa has said it will cancel the World Cup 2022 contracts of any hotel in Qatar that does not allow same-sex couples to stay. .Unless you are in corporate hospitality, then you will not be able to buy alcohol in the eight stadiums. .Fifa had initially said ticket holders would be able to buy alcohol within the stadium perimeter before and after matches, but two days before the tournament the policy was changed. .That means alcohol-free Budweiser Zero - provided by one of the tournament sponsors - will be the only beer on sale for match goers. .Those in corporate areas of stadiums will still be able to purchase alcohol. .The only place to buy alcohol for most fans will be at licenced hotel restaurants and bars and certain fan zones, where a pint will cost around £12. .It is thought that some Qatari hotels will not show World Cup matches as the broadcast subscriptions cost too much. .Pints of beer in Doha are normally priced between £12 and £15, although World Cup organisers are reportedly working on happy-hour dealsexternal-link which would potentially halve prices at certain times. .Al Bidda Park fan zone, which has a 40,000 capacity, will show games on a giant screen. It has an alcohol licence from 18:30 to 01:00 local time. .The Arcadia music festival will be open from 10:00 to 05:00, serve alcohol and feature a fire-breathing 50-tonne 'Spider' which has been used at Glastonbury, but tickets cost upwards of £75 a day. .Non-residents cannot buy alcohol in shops. The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21 and it is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in a public place. .""What will be missing is the usual vibrancy and interaction on the streets with many of the bars tucked away in hotels,"" said Brown. .""Thirty two sets of fans all in one place watching games. No one knows what that's going to be like, it's never been done before. I'm sure they'll be some fantastic pictures of fans enjoying themselves together but maybe there's some challenges as well."" .World Cup chief Nasser Al Khater has indicated drunk fans will be sent to special zones to sober up.external-link .The accommodation situation means some supporters have opted to fly in and out for matches from elsewhere. .Qatar Airways has withdrawn flights from 18 destinations to make space at Hamad International Airport for airlines transporting fans, and expects about 500 shuttle flights a day. .Capacity at the Abu Samra road border crossing to/from Saudi Arabia has been doubled to 4,000 travellers per hour .Germany's official fan group have reserved 300 places in a four-star hotel in Dubai, while Brown expects a ""a reasonable number travelling in and out from places including Dubai"".",108
109,15,18 November 2022,Qatar World Cup: 'Football is leaving behind its LGBT fans'," .Days before the World Cup kicks off in Qatar, a fan group has said football is ""leaving behind"" its LGBT supporters. .Although Qatar says all fans will be welcome without discrimination, homosexuality is illegal there. .Steve Lovell runs Villa and Proud in Birmingham and said the group's members were conflicted about whether or not to engage with the tournament. .""I couldn't be my authentic self over there, I could end up in prison and that's a real moral dilemma,"" he said. .The LGBT support group surveyed its members to gauge how the fans were feeling in the run up to the first game on Sunday. .""We asked our members, 'if we were to give you a free ticket to Qatar, accommodation, flights, everything, would you go'? And 88% of the responses said no, they wouldn't,"" Mr Lovell said. .""It's a real conflict,"" he added. ""I don't know whether to support them [England], whether to watch or not watch it, it's difficult."" .He said members' mental health was being impacted and Villa and Proud was increasing its events as a result. .""The footballing world can come together and support the World Cup but unfortunately it's leaving behind its LGBTQ+ fans, so we need to be there to support everybody."" .Qatar's record on human rights and its treatment of migrant workers as well as its stance on same-sex relationships have made it a controversial choice for the World Cup. .Fifa has written to teams telling them to ""focus on the football"", not politics, but Mr Lovell said that was ""very upsetting"". .""To say 'just to focus on the football' is to ignore a part of my life and it's totally disrespectful."" .John Paul Kesseler, from Birmingham Blaze, an LGBT football club, agrees. .""Football doesn't exist in a vacuum,"" he said. .""To say politics shouldn't be a part of football, equality shouldn't be a part of football, is to misunderstand the way the world works."" .He said players at the club were ""angry"" about the World Cup being held in Qatar, although some, including full back Jacob Leeks, still planned to watch the tournament. .""I am going to watch it, it's giving into them if I don't watch it,"" he said. ""It's a personal choice though and not everyone will feel like I do."" .The first game of the tournament is to be held on Sunday when Qatar play Ecuador. .Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

At that time I was thinking there is something wrong with me for being gay and I didn't accept it. .I was trying to change myself - we are raised like that. .Everything around us says being gay is wrong and God will punish us for being gay. My home country is a religious country and Islam is the religion. .It took me a long time to accept myself. .Once I became comfortable and accepted myself for who I am, that's when everything changed and I felt so relieved. .The environment I was living in wasn't helpful. Older people don't know anything about LGBT since the TV and radio is all controlled by the government. .The younger generation knows about it thanks to the internet, but still, you can't be yourself. .You will go to jail or face death if someone finds out you are gay. .Gay exists - but everyone is scared to talk about it. .It was a very hard decision to move to a different country, even though I knew I could be myself in UK. .I lived my whole life in my home country. .I have my family and friends who I do love, even if they won't support me if I come out. .It's not their fault to not accept me or other people because of their sexuality. It's the way they've been raised and it's hard to change that in a blink of an eye. .It will take time. .It's hard to explain that feeling of being yourself and not having to consistently lie about who you are. .Since I've come here, everyone is so supporting and, after almost three years, I have people and friends around me. .And having a supportive husband is everything I could ask for. .I consider my friends as a family and I'm so lucky to have them, especially those from the local LGBT community. .I'm not afraid to come out - but I know the consequences if I did. .I know what my family will go through and how they will blame themselves. They will think it's their fault that I am who I am. .I know what I'm going to say next contradicts what I believe in or what I'm saying. .But I always say that if you visit another country you have to respect the rules and the laws even if it's not right. .You can't just go there and break them. If you did, you have to accept what will happen. .I'm not saying we have to keep silent. I think everyone should speak out. .I blame FIFA for giving Qatar the rights to host, when they know that human rights there are not respected. .But this is a great opportunity to focus the light on the human rights there. .Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube. .Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. .'A desert World Cup and a dust-storm of controversy' .LGBT venues to boycott World Cup games .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup .Coming out as bisexual to my football teammates .'Inclusion is bringing LGBT fans back to football' .Footballer Josh Cavallo comes out as gay",110

18 November 2022",2022 World Cup: The numbers which make the Qatar event so different," .The World Cup in Qatar starts on Sunday in what promises to be a unique tournament - in both good and bad ways. .So what will make it so different? .At 29 days from start to finish (20 November to 18 December), this will be the shortest World Cup since Argentina 1978. .That means organisers have to squeeze in four games most days during the group stages - at 10:00, 13:00, 16:00 and 19:00 GMT. Most World Cups in recent memory have had three a day. .There is also no turnaround time between the groups and the knockout stages, with the last 16 starting the day after the group stages end. .There are only about 40 miles between the two furthest away stadiums - Al Bayt Stadium north of Doha to Al Janoub Stadium just south of the capital. .The drive takes just 50 minutes without traffic. .Seven of the eight World Cup stadiums have been built from scratch for this tournament. Seven of the eight will have seats removed after the tournament... and Stadium 974, which is made of shipping containers, will be entirely disassembled. .Only one of the eight grounds will be the home stadium of a football team afterwards (Al Rayyan at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium). .In total about 200,000 seats will be removed from grounds (and, according to organisers, be gifted to developing countries) after the final. .As a country that does not get near the top 100 in the world for population or size, it is perhaps no surprise that Qatar cannot offer the accommodation usually seen at a World Cup. .In March, the country had just 30,000 hotel rooms - with official figures suggesting 1.5 million people are coming. .They hope to have a total of 130,000 rooms available in the country in time for fans coming - including 9,000 beds in fans villages, big tents and metal cabins, 60,000 rooms in apartments and villas, 50,000 in hotels and 4,000 rooms in two cruise ships which will remain docked for the tournament. .The lack of rooms means some fans will have to stay in neighbouring countries such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and fly in for their games. Oman is offering free visas and 24 special flights a day from Muscat to Doha. .Qatar has had to build a lot of infrastructure to host this tournament. As well as the stadiums, more than 100 hotels have popped up and there have been new roads and a metro built. .A new city is going to be built around the final stadium in Lusail. The budget for just stadiums and training facilities alone is £5.3bn. .Despite all the issues with accommodation, 2.89 million tickets were sold at the last update in October - meaning this could be one of the best attended World Cups ever. .The price of a beer is about £10 to £15 in Qatar - although there are huge restrictions on where you can buy alcohol. .Usually, licensed hotel bars and restaurants are the only options in Qatar, although during the World Cup, fan zones and the grounds around the stadium will also sell beer. .The fan zones will reportedly charge £11.60 for 500ml of lager. .Drinking alcohol in public places (outside of these areas) can result in a prison sentence of up to six months and a fine of more than £700. .Some 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 will be emitted during the tournament. It was 2.1 million in Russia. .More than 6,500 migrant workers are thought to have died in Qatar from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka alone from when the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010 to 2020, according to a Guardian investigationexternal-link last year. .The Qatar government said the total was misleading, because not all the deaths recorded were of people working on World Cup-related projects. .Amnesty International says there are no exact figures because the Qatari authorities have failed to investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers over the past decade. .Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-link .Get your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC Sounds",111

I will do the same when I go to Qatar."" .France begin their World Cup campaign against Australia on Tuesday and will also face Denmark and Tunisia in Group D. .Denmark will wear ""toned-down"" shirts to protest against Qatar, with kit provider Hummel saying it ""does not wish to be visible"" in a tournament it claims ""has cost thousands of lives"", while Australia's squad have released a video urging Qatar to abolish its laws on same-sex relationships. .Get the latest results and goal notifications for any team at the Fifa World Cup by downloading the BBC Sport app: Appleexternal-link - Androidexternal-link - Amazonexternal-link",114

118,24,16 November 2022,Qatar World Cup: Families seek answers over migrant worker deaths," .Qatar has transformed its infrastructure in the run up to the World Cup, which starts on Sunday. Millions of people from South Asia have been employed on building projects, including from Nepal - where families have told the BBC safety failures led to the death of their loved ones. .In the early hours of 10 November, Qatar airlines flight QR 644 touched down at Nepal's Kathmandu airport. .Among the cargo unloaded from the plane was a large white wooden box. ""Human Remains of late Umesh Kumar Yadav, 32 years male, Nepali"" was written on the outside. .In Golbazar, 250km (155 miles) south-east of Kathmandu, his father ties up his buffalo outside his brick house. He lives in one of the poorest districts of one of the poorest nations in the world, where opportunity is scarce. .When his son Umesh was offered the chance to go and work in Qatar, one of the world's richest countries, Laxman Yadav sold some buffalo to pay $1,500 (£1,250) to an employment agent who promised to arrange a job. .It's common for agents to visit impoverished areas not just in Nepal, but in Bangladesh and India, offering young men a lucrative job overseas, in exchange for large sums of money to secure them a visa. .The workers are often passed from contract to contract, making it hard for the families to know where their relatives are working, and for whom. .A two-hour drive away in the district of Dhanusha is Krishna Mandal's house. His father Sitesh left to work in Qatar four years ago. .Sometimes Sitesh sent his son selfies while at work. ""He told me he worked on water tanks, but didn't tell us too much about what he was doing,"" says Krishna. .Sitesh was due to return for a visit on 12 October. But just days before, Krishna got a phone call telling him his father had been killed in an accident. .A family friend said Sitesh was been working on sewage pipes, seven feet below ground in the capital Doha, when a heavy mound of earth fell onto him. His death certificate said he suffered ""multiple blunt injuries due to solid object impact"". .Krishna says he hasn't received a single phone call from his father's employer, or an offer of compensation. The BBC contacted the company Sitesh worked for to get a comment, but they didn't respond. .From Golbazar, Laxman didn't know too much about his son's life in Qatar - he does not own a smartphone and couldn't follow the daily updates Umesh used to post on TikTok. .In his videos, he could be seen dancing in front of Qatar's glitzy skyline or in his dorm-style accommodation with other migrant workers. .Umesh also shared clips of him at work on construction sites - smiling from on top of a ladder, or even - in true TikTok fashion - lifting heavy concrete blocks as a challenge. .On 26 October, Umesh posted a video of himself dancing at night in front of some skyscrapers running adverts for the upcoming World Cup. .It was the last post he'd ever make. .Umesh's cousin, also called Laxman, and also working in Qatar, got a call on 27 October to say he had died. He went with others to the construction site to find out how. .""They told us Umesh was taking the scaffold lift up, when it touched something and broke, and he fell down,"" he said. .""They should have taken care of safety at the workplace,"" Laxman says. ""They should have checked everything and only then allowed people to work."" .The BBC has been in touch with the construction company Umesh worked for - they strenuously deny a lapse in safety caused his death. .""The accident occurred as a result of his negligence and recklessness,"" their statement said. ""The worker who died was very careless on the site and was notified many times to abide by the safety conditions like the rest of his colleagues, but to no avail."" .Since World Cup construction began in Qatar, reports have emerged of the difficult conditions for and deaths of migrant workers. .Qatar's government says it is committed to ""ensuring the health, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects"". It told the BBC it has improved health and safety regulations. .But new figures given to the BBC by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre show that in the past year there have been close to 140 cases of violations of workers' rights, with around half relating to health and safety issues. .They believe the true figure might be higher, partly due to fear of reprisal. .The BBC has seen more than a dozen death certificates of workers from across South Asia over a six-year period. Many cite the cause of death as ""multiple blunt injuries"". Families say they still want answers. .While Umesh's coffin made its way from the airport to Golbazar, his father Laxman and dozens of other villagers prepared for his last rites - collecting piles of wood and hay to start the fire. .In Nepal it is tradition for the eldest son to light the pyre. Laxman held Umesh's son, 13-month-old Sushant, easing a stick into the baby's tiny hand so he could start the fire. .""He used to support us. We have loans to pay, and his young children to support,"" Umesh's mother Sumitra said, her face wet with tears. ""He was my hero."" .Additional reporting by Rajneesh Bhandari, Rammohan Pateriya and Mrigakshi Shukla. .How does Qatar treat foreign workers? .'A desert World Cup and a dust-storm of controversy'",118

120,26,15 November 2022,Leeds: The Mustard Pot reverses decision to show Qatar World Cup," .A Leeds landlady has reversed her decision to screen the World Cup following concerns from her regulars about Qatar's treatment of LGBT people. .Nicola Moxham, of The Mustard Pot, in Chapel Allerton, told the BBC she had already sold dozens of tickets. .However, after listening carefully to feedback from patrons, she cancelled planned World Cup screenings. .She said: ""We have listened to our customers."" .Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, where same-sex relationships can be punishable by death. .Qatar has said all supporters will be welcomed ""without discrimination"" but a number of venues have taken a similar position to The Mustard Pot. .Ms Moxham, who has run the Georgian-style pub for 15 years, said: ""This is a lovely little community, and we listen to our customers. I really appreciated their feedback."" .She revealed staff had sold about 75 of the 100 tickets made available for screenings. .Fans were being offered a deal that included entry to watch the football, a drink and food for £15. .She has now refunded all customers. .""We were hoping to be completely sold out,"" said Ms Moxham. .The publican acknowledged the decision not to screen games would likely cost her money but added she did not want to offend regulars whose judgement she trusted. .""People are saying, 'hey they're not showing the World Cup - let's go and support them'."" .With the benefit of hindsight, she admitted she should have delved deeper into Qatar's stance on LGBT people. .""A few months ago, it was a case of, football is on, I'll show it. I should have looked more into it but I was busy with life,"" said Ms Moxham. .She said initial criticism from customers at her decision to screen the World Cup was not ""nasty"" but was borne from genuine concern. .Ms Moxham is not the only publican turning her back on the World Cup. .Businessman Lawrence Barton, who runs several venues in Birmingham's Gay Village, said they would not be showing games. .The World Cup gets underway on Sunday, with the host nation facing Ecuador. .Organisers have previously stated ""everyone is welcome"" to visit Qatar to watch the tournament. .Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

121,27,15 November 2022,No uniform choice for Virgin Atlantic crew on World Cup flight," .Virgin Atlantic has said its gender-neutral uniform policy does not apply to the crew on board the England team's flight to the World Cup in Qatar. .The airline announced a ""fluid approach"" to uniforms in September that it said allowed staff to choose their attire ""no matter their gender"". .But a spokeswoman told BBC News the crew for Tuesday's flight to Doha would not be able to choose their uniform. .Virgin said a plane displaying an LGBT icon would be used for the journey. .There has been criticism of human rights in Qatar and its treatment of LGBT people ahead of the World Cup. .Qatar has said all fans will be welcomed to the tournament ""without discrimination"". .Explaining why the gender-neutral uniform policy did not apply to Tuesday's flight, Virgin Atlantic said it was being rolled out in countries ""more accepting of non-binary identities"". .""Initially the UK, US and Israel are the territories where the uniform policy is being rolled out for our people, as those countries are more accepting of non-binary identities allowing more self-expression,"" it said. .Virgin explained that it considers safety and risk in destinations ""on a case by case basis to ensure the safety and security of our people and customers at all times"". .The airline, which does not usually operate to Qatar, did not set out this caveat in a press release announcing the new uniform policy in September. .A plane displaying an LGBT icon was selected for the six-hour charter flight from Birmingham airport to the Qatari capital, the airline said. .The A350 plane, named ""Rain Bow"" and carrying the image of a man holding a union flag wearing shoes with a rainbow motif on its fuselage, flew Gareth Southgate's team to Doha. .The Football Association (FA) said that, while it did not choose the plane, it was more than happy to fly on it. .It is illegal to be homosexual in Qatar, and same-sex relationships can be punishable by death. .Footballers, including England captain Harry Kane, have taken a stand in support of the LGBT community in recent months. .Kane has said he intends to wear his One Love rainbow captain armband during World Cup matches, even if it is not approved for use by the football's global governing body, Fifa, which runs the World Cup. .An FA spokesperson said: ""We show our support for inclusion in many ways, including wearing the One Love Armband during the tournament"". .Earlier this year, LGBT organisations engaging with Fifa said ""progress has been slow"" in ensuring the safety of LGBT fans - and that reassurances from Qatar had ""not been adequate"". .In response, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly advised LGBT fans show ""a little bit of flex and compromise"" if they travel to the tournament. .Mr Cleverly, who will travel to Qatar, said fans travelling from England and Wales should be ""respectful of the host nation"". .Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman later said LGBT fans should not be expected to ""compromise who they are"" if they visit Qatar for the World Cup. .Some politicians, including Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, said they would not attend the tournament due to Qatar's human rights record. .Wales's First Minister, Labour's Mark Drakeford, is expected to attend. .The England team are expected to land in Qatar at around 20:00 local time and arrive at their team base at about 21:00 GMT. .The UK government's World Cup travel advice sets out the legal status of homosexuality in Qatar and the assurances given by its authorities. .The first match of the tournament will be between Qatar and Ecuador on 20 November. England's first game is against Iran on 21 November. .Announcing the gender-neutral uniform policy in September, Virgin Atlantic said staff, including crew, pilots, and ground teams, could choose to wear a uniform including either a trousers or a skirt. .It described the policy as one element of a campaign to allow LGBT staff and passengers to express themselves, including through optional pronoun badges for all staff and those travelling with the airline. .'Be respectful of the host nation' - LGBT fans told .Call to warn LGBT+ World Cup fans about Qatar risk .Qatar officials stop Peter Tatchell's LGBT protest",121

15 November 2022",Qatar 2022: 'World Cup controversies take some excitement away' - Gabby Logan," .I've been going to World Cups as a journalist since France 1998, and the build-up to this one is the most unusual I've ever experienced. .Normally, when I am about to go to these tournaments, I am just thinking about what I am expecting to see on the pitch and getting excited about what is always a great festival of football - as I am sure most of you do too. .That's not the case this time. We are only days away from the first game but the background behind Qatar hosting this World Cup and the controversies surrounding the regime there take some of that excitement away, and make me feel uncomfortable about the whole occasion. .I am going there as a broadcaster, and where the World Cup is held is not something any of us can influence. There was consternation about the last hosts, Russia in 2018, too. .But as my colleague Gary Lineker has already said, the BBC will be in Qatar reporting, not supporting the regime there and elements of what they stand for. .Clearly Qatar wants the world to look at it, because it asked to host this World Cup and doing so is a marker of its position on the world stage, but surely with that honour comes a responsibility - and there are fundamental human rights issues there that we know could be improved. .We will still get excited about the football when it starts, but what we can also do during the next five weeks is shine a light on Qatar and its stance on issues like same-sex relationships, women's rights and the treatment of migrant workers. .When you expose those situations, as so many great journalists and human rights groups have done in the build-up to this tournament, then you hope you draw people's attention to what is happening and what needs to change, in parts of the world they might not ordinarily think about. .The success of World Cups is usually determined by how much entertainment they provide - things like the TV spectacle, and what the facilities for fans were like. .This time, we should remember the treatment of the migrant workers involved in the vast construction project for this tournament - including the gleaming new stadiums that will be seen around the world - and instead judge Qatar on whether some of the issues I have mentioned do change and get better in the future. .We certainly won't know that while this World Cup is going on. It is likely to be a few years until we find out if basic human rights and workers' rights improve in Qatar, and if all people there have the ability to express themselves and live freely in their own country. .Those are the aspirations I'd have for the legacy of this World Cup, and I think most people would see them as being positive things to aim for. .For that legacy to happen, though, we need to have collaborative conversations about these topics while the tournament is going on; while the world is watching. .You cannot just ignore them. That's why I found Fifa's letter earlier this month, telling the 32 teams taking part to ""now focus on the football"", an especially difficult statement to swallow. .To those who would say - as Fifa appears to be doing - that everyone should just respect Qatar's rules and regulations when they are there, I would respond that is not a helpful or productive way of dealing with this situation. .Instead, the most important thing that can happen while this World Cup is taking place is that people have the right to express their opinion. .If, for example, while he is competing in Qatar, a player wants to stand up and say that he is really against the idea that people from the LGBTQ+ community cannot freely live the life they want to in this country, then it is his right to say that. .Equally, it is not just the job of the players to be speaking out. If some of them do just want to focus on the football, then we have to respect that too. .There will be 832 players at this World Cup and the idea that all of them are going to address the discrepancies of human rights in Qatar is fanciful. .But if someone does want to speak, they should be allowed to - whoever they are. .I've joined a WhatsApp group with other women who are working at the World Cup across different stations, not just the BBC. .Some of them already work at BeIN Sports, which is based in Qatar, and they have been talking about the fact they feel very safe, as well as giving advice about what potentially we should wear over there. .When you go to an Arabic country there are certain dress codes to think about for men too, and the alcohol laws there will affect everyone, but I hope female fans who are travelling to watch the tournament feel they can behave how they want to. .I think we will only find out in the first few days of the World Cup what the fans' experience will be like in Qatar, and also what the crowds will be like. .I was disappointed when I came to Doha in 2019 to work on the World Athletics Championships and the Khalifa International Stadium was empty, or nearly empty, for a lot of the big events. .That meant athletes who had worked their whole lives to try to break world records and win gold medals at one of the biggest events in their sport were doing it in front of thousands of empty seats. .It came off the back of London hosting the same event in 2017, when every session was pretty much sold out, so the contrast was stark and I didn't feel we should ignore that. .Speaking out about it did not go down well with the sport's governing body, or its president Seb Coe, but I would do it again around any issues that arise at this World Cup. .Some fans might be happy to watch from afar wherever these big events take place without giving it too much thought but, when we look back, I think this period of history will throw up lots of questions about how and where they happen in the future. .The official switch to make Qatar 2022 a winter World Cup came in February 2015 - more than four years after they won their bid to host it. .Since then, people have talked about how troubled they are by the timing of this tournament, as well as the environmental impact of building lots of new stadiums, hotels and the rest of the infrastructure that was needed. .That hasn't stopped this World Cup from happening now, of course, but it should hopefully make us think more about the merits of spreading these finals and other major sporting events around the world and continuously making them bigger and bigger. .As I've said for a while now, the sustainability of these events is something else that needs to be addressed, and everyone needs to think a little harder about all the consequences of choosing certain hosts. .Gabby Logan was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",122

He was held in Greece in 2020, under an Interpol warrant, over a conviction for carrying a herb-grinder on a plane trip that stopped in Doha. .She told BBC Scotland Mr Glendinning had been ""aggressively pursued"" to take out a loan by his bank in Qatar, as is ""standard practice"" there. .Ms Stirling added: ""The problem with Qatar banks is when they want to pursue someone on Interpol to put pressure on the family to pay the debt, they add legal fees and charges to get the amount over the Interpol threshold, which is €15,000, then wait for that person to be detained and put pressure on their parents or their families to sell assets or use their life's savings to bail out their child."" .The Foreign and Commonwealth Development office confirmed it was providing consular support to Mr Glendinning. .Scot freed in Iraq after Qatari conviction arrest .Scot held in Iraq over unknown Qatari conviction .Scot held in Greek jail over joke gift to fly home .'He's no Pablo Escobar, just a guy from Tranent'",124

127,33,14 November 2022,Scot freed in Iraq after Qatari conviction arrest," .A construction engineer who spent two months in custody in Iraq over a debt conviction in Qatar has been freed. .Brian Glendinning, 43, from Fife, did not know he was on an Interpol list as a wanted fugitive until he was detained in Basra on his way to a new job. .His family last month called on the UK government to intervene. .Campaign group Detained in Dubai said Mr Glendinning was released on Sunday and is expected to return home to Kincardine within days. .Last week, the bank which is owed the money issued a clearance note stamped by the authorities in Qatar saying they no longer wanted him extradited. .Mr Glendinning's brother John told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the conditions in the Iraqi prison were ""vile"". .""Brian was held in a holding cell with up to 44 people - a mixture of terrorists, drug dealers, people who murdered their own father, using a shotgun,"" he said. .""And there was Brian Glendinning, never missed a day of school and arguably on a civil case and held in those conditions. .""The welfare was extremely low. Bottles of water were kept where rats were visible crawling over them. Brown water out the taps for the shower and food was very poor."" .Mr Glendinning said that he has been picked up by British embassy staff and was now in a secure hotel. .""He's in the hotel. I've seen a photo of him with a beer and I'm so happy he's free."" .""To see his name come up on my phone, it is hard to put into words how that felt because I have been dreaming of that."" .It is hoped he will be back in Fife as soon as possible. .In 2017 Mr Glendinning, who is married with three children and one granddaughter, was sentenced in his absence to two years in prison for defaulting on a debt. .He had agreed to take out a £20,000 loan with his bank in Qatar while working in Doha in 2016, but was not able to keep up full repayments when he lost his job. .His family told how he was made redundant in 2017, while on sick leave at home in Scotland, but had kept in touch with the bank not realising he had been convicted of a crime. .He only discovered the arrest warrant meant he was on an Interpol red list when he was detained at Basra airport in September. .His brother sold his car to help pay his brother's legal bills, which within four weeks of his arrest had soared to £30,000. .A crowdfunding appeal set up by the family to help cover legal costs has since raised more than £30,700 of a £40,000 target. .The family also warned football fans going to the World Cup, which starts next Sunday, to be aware of the risks in traveling to Qatar. .Since Mr Glendinning's arrest they have been supported by Radha Stirling, the founder of Detained in Dubai and IPEX. .She has helped hundreds of people unfairly detained in or at risk of being extradited to the UAE and the Middle East. .These include Conor Howard, an engineer from Tranent, East Lothian. He was held in Greece in 2020, under an Interpol warrant, over a conviction for carrying a herb-grinder on a plane trip that stopped in Doha. .She told BBC Scotland Mr Glendinning had been ""aggressively pursued"" to take out a loan by his bank in Qatar, as is ""standard practice"" there. .Ms Stirling added: ""The problem with Qatar banks is when they want to pursue someone on Interpol to put pressure on the family to pay the debt, they add legal fees and charges to get the amount over the Interpol threshold, which is €15,000, then wait for that person to be detained and put pressure on their parents or their families to sell assets or use their life's savings to bail out their child."" .The Foreign and Commonwealth Development office confirmed it was providing consular support to Mr Glendinning. .John Glendinning said he believed it would take a long time for his brother to recover from his ordeal. .He said: ""This won't be over for some time. .""This is going to have a huge impact on my brother's mental health. He was already nine weeks in there. .""It could be up to three months without employment and this is going to have a massive impact financially on his family and on his mental health."" .Scot held in Iraq over unknown Qatari conviction .Scot held in Greek jail over joke gift to fly home .'He's no Pablo Escobar, just a guy from Tranent'",127

14 November 2022",World Cup 2022: A desert World Cup blighted by a dust-storm of controversy," .'Now is All' is the official Qatar World Cup slogan. A message, perhaps, to focus on the present - and the on-field action that is about to begin. To move on from the past. If only it were that simple. .It says a great deal that Qatar 2022 is considered by many to be the most controversial sports mega-event in a very long time. After all, the competition for such a title is considerable. .Over the past 20 years, China has twice played host to the Olympics. In the past decade, meanwhile, Russia has staged both the Winter Games and the 2018 football World Cup. .Yet despite the scale of the human rights atrocities that both those countries stand accused of - and fears such events have been used to embolden their autocratic regimes - it is arguably Qatar that has provoked most dismay and anger during the 12 years since world governing body Fifa shocked the world by handing it the right to organise football's showpiece event. .A key ally of the West - unlike China and Russia - and now reportedly the 10th biggest landowner in the UK, with Heathrow, Harrods and the Shard among its many British investments, as well as an increasingly important supplier of gas as the UK struggles with rising energy costs, Qatar insists the notoriety of its World Cup is unfair. .The promise is this first Middle Eastern World Cup will be a spectacular, ground-breaking tournament that should be celebrated. An event that will welcome all, grow the sport, inspire youth, boost tourism, diversify the country's economy, and promote sustainability. And with regional tensions partly eased by the lifting of an economic blockade by Qatar's neighbours last year, there are hopes it could also prove a unifying force. .But there is no denying the build-up to this tournament has been especially troubled. .As soon as the since-disgraced former Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced Qatar's victory back in 2010, there was deep suspicion over how precisely this tiny desert state - with no history in the World Cup, and scorching summer temperatures - had won. .Allegations of corruption, vote-swapping, and links to trade deals at the highest levels of government have always been denied by organisers and remain unproven. .But it cannot be overlooked that of the 22 Fifa executive committee members who voted on that fateful day 12 years ago, with two other officials already suspended at the time after a newspaper expose that alleged the pair had asked for cash in return for World Cup votes, most have since been accused, banned or indicted over allegations of corruption and wrongdoing. .As recently as 2020 - as part of the FBI's vast corruption probe into the governing body - US prosecutors accused three former senior Fifa officials of receiving bribes for voting in favour of Qatar. .Qatar was cleared of corruption by Fifa several years ago, but many people have made their minds up, believing the country effectively bought the World Cup. Blatter himself has suggested the vote was partly the result of an arms deal between the country and France. .There was then concern over how players and fans would cope with the extreme summer temperatures they were originally told they would face, followed by exasperation over the unprecedented upheaval the subsequent rescheduling of the event has caused the football calendar. There have been worries over player welfare as a result of squeezing it into the middle of the European season, and the security operation in an Islamic country with strict rules over alcohol, and no experience of policing anything on this scale. .The environmental impact of the tournament is another issue. Fifa admits Qatar 2022 will leave a much bigger carbon footprint than any other World Cup, in one of the world's least sustainable countries. But experts are now suggesting emissions could be three times the official estimate, undermining claims this will be the first 'carbon neutral' World Cup. .Organisers insist, however, that sustainability is at the heart of their tournament - pointing to the fact this World Cup is the most 'compact' ever, with it effectively taking place in one city, along with a fleet of electric buses, and an off-setting and carbon credits programme. .There is also the legacy of the tournament's eight stadiums to consider. Seven new venues have been built. One, made from storage containers and named Stadium 974, will be dismantled at the end of the tournament and six others will be repurposed with some becoming hotels or community spaces. .Amid concern many supporters will have been priced out of the event, there is uncertainty about the fan experience in Qatar. Apartments, hotel rooms, desert camping, villas, fan villages and even cabins on moored cruise ships have been made available. .But some fans have complained of limited and expensive accommodation options. Organisers are making 30,000 extra rooms available, which they say is the equivalent of one million nights and will help provide 130,000 rooms in all. .However, it remains unclear whether that will be enough to meet demand. .Most damaging to the reputation of the event have been persistent fears over the human toll of building the infrastructure required in such a short period of time and in such a climate, along with discriminatory laws which prohibit homosexuality, and curtail women's freedoms through male guardianship rules. .The authorities say there have been three 'work-related' deaths on actual stadium construction sites since work began in 2014 - and 37 more off-site fatalities that are not 'work related'. The Supreme Committee vows worker welfare is a priority. .Official figures show 15,000 non-Qatarisexternal-link died in the country between 2010 and 2019. .The authorities insist that figure is commensurate with the size of the migrant workforce. But how many of those deaths were linked to work - and whether that work was linked to the World Cup - is both disputed, and unclear. .Human rights campaigners say thousands of deaths are effectively unexplained because of a lack of investigation. Last year, the Guardianexternal-link found 6,500 migrant workers from five countries - India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal - had died between 2010 and 2020, with 69% of the deaths among Indian, Nepali and Bangladeshi workers attributed to natural causes. .Regardless of the official statistics, or recent labour reforms, campaigners insist this tournament will always be blood-stained. .Meanwhile, organisers have always maintained all visitors will be welcome regardless of race, religion, gender or sexuality, but they have also said they expect their laws and culture to be respected, and many LGBT fans say they have not received the assurances over safety that they needed. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was criticised for urging gay fans to show some ""flex and compromise"", and since then the Sports Minister, Stuart Andrew, has ""sought assurances"" from the Qatar authorities. .A recent report by Human Rights Watchexternal-link saying members of Qatar's LGBTQ+ community were detained and physically abused by the country's security services has done little to ease the tension. Nor did a World Cup ambassador's much-criticised comments that homosexuality is ""damage in the mind"". How all this can be reconciled with the promise of a 'World Cup for all' remains unclear. .Qatar 2022 has certainly forced sport to consider to what extent such tournaments can bring about social change, whether compromise is incumbent on the host country - or those who visit - and the tensions that arise when global events expand into new territories. .It is hard to argue that hosting major sports events in Russia and China, for instance, was a catalyst for change. .Most agree amendments to Qatar's labour system in recent years - with more protection for workers, a minimum wage and the dismantling of the 'kafala' sponsorship system - have only happened because of the greater international scrutiny that has accompanied the World Cup. However, human rights groups also say these are yet to be fully implemented. And they are dismayed by the failure to set up a Migrant Worker Centre, and a compensation fund for the families of those killed or injured. .Equally, while some politicians and fans have said they will not travel to Qatar on principle, and some European cities have said they will not show matches in public places in protest at human rights abuses, there are those who believe it is much better to take the World Cup to conservative Muslim countries like this and shine a light. But many see it as hypocritical of Fifa to state a commitment to non-discrimination in its statutes, while at the same time awarding the World Cup to hosts where it is against the law for some people to simply be themselves. .Would it not be better, it is often asked, for equal rights to be a condition of staging such events - or at least considered? There was no mention of worker or human rights in Fifa's evaluation of the Qatar bid back in 2010, for example. Should demands over protections not have been put in place then? .It is a sign of the emotions that swirl around this event, and the divisions it has caused, that some of the game's highest-profile names have found themselves drawn into these debates. .Former England defender Gary Neville, for instance, has been criticised for agreeing to commentate at the World Cup for a Qatar-owned TV network, while close friend David Beckham has drawn similar opprobrium - including Eric Cantona, another Manchester United great - for accepting a lucrative ambassadorial role for the event. .Fifa, meanwhile, sparked an outcry by urging competing teams to ""focus on football"", rather than getting ""dragged into every ideological or political battle"". .With Russia already banned, there are also calls for the exclusion of Iran, whose drones are believed to be being used by Moscow to terrorise Ukrainian civilians, and which has launched a crackdown on protesters following the death of a young woman in the custody of the state's morality police. .Meanwhile, with a host of teams taking stands via videos, training tops and armbands, perhaps Fifa was worried about how and where to draw the line. No country is perfect, after all. And its stance received support from the football confederations of both Asia and South America. .But as 10 European football associations suggested as they responded in a joint statement, in an era when players are increasingly keen to express their views on social and political issues, and human rights are regarded as universal and non-negotiable, Fifa's request that teams stay silent seems increasingly unrealistic. .The hosts will be banking on the narrative shifting - as it always seems to do - once the action gets under way. But if, as many have concluded, this is an example of 'sportswashing' - an attempt to use sport to project a positive image of the country - a testament to its wealth and power - is it backfiring? .Over the past two years, much of the world's attention has been diverted - first by Covid, then the war in Ukraine. But in recent weeks, as the tournament has loomed into view, there has been a barrage of negative headlines, from reports of secret hacking operations to the revelation that fans were being paid to 'spy'external-link on their friends - something that was denied by the tournament's organisers.external-link .The increasingly exasperated Qatari authorities have started to suggest their critics are not only hypocritical but perhaps even motivated by racism.external-link .The motto their bid team used in 2010 was 'Expect Amazing'. Maybe they did not expect the constant scrutiny a winning vote would bring. .And now, more than a decade on, as this World Cup in the desert finally gets under way, many will find it truly amazing if this event is ultimately remembered more for the football, than the ferocious dust-storm of controversy that has preceded it. .More reading on Qatar 2022 World Cup",128

136,42,9 November 2022,World Cup 2022: How has Qatar treated foreign workers?," .The football fans who will soon arrive in Qatar for the World Cup finals will stay in hotels and watch matches in stadiums which were built by tens of thousands of migrant workers. .Qatar has come under intense scrutiny for the way it treats these workers. .Qatar has built seven stadiums for the World Cup finals as well as a new airport, metro system, series of roads and about 100 new hotels. .An entire city has been constructed around the stadium which will host the final match. .Qatar's government says that 30,000 foreign labourers were hired just to build the stadiums. Most come from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and the Philippines. .In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid. .The number is based on figures provided by the countries' embassies in Qatar. .However, the Qatar government has said the total is misleading, because not all the deaths recorded were of people working on World Cup-related projects. .It said that many of those who died had worked in Qatar for several years, and could have died from old age or other natural causes. .The government said its accident records showed that between 2014 and 2020, there were 37 deaths among labourers at World Cup stadium construction sites, only three of which were ""work-related"". .However, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says this is an underestimate. Qatar doesn't count deaths from heart attacks and respiratory failure as work-related - even though these are common symptoms of heatstroke, brought on from doing heavy labour in very high temperatures. .It has compiled its own figures for World Cup related incidents, collected from government-run hospitals and ambulance services in Qatar. .It says 50 foreign labourers died and more than 500 others were seriously injured in 2021 alone, while another 37,600 suffered mild to moderate injuries. .BBC Arabic has also gathered evidence which suggests Qatar's government has under-reported deaths amongst foreign labourers. .Life at 50C: Qatar accused of under-reporting deaths in Gulf's killer heat .Ever since Qatar won the rights to host the World Cup in 2010, human rights groups have criticised its treatment of foreign workers. .In 2016, Amnesty International accused Qatari companies of using forced labour. .It said many workers lived in squalid accommodation, were forced to pay huge recruitment fees and had wages withheld and their passports confiscated. .Since 2017, the government has introduced measures to protect foreign labourers from working in very hot weather, limit their working hours, and improve the conditions in workers' camps. .However, in a 2021 report, campaign group Human Rights Watch said foreign workers were still suffering from ""punitive and illegal wage deductions"", and faced ""months of unpaid wages for long hours of gruelling work"". .Qatari companies used to operate a system called ""kafala"", under which they sponsored foreign workers to come to the country but then prevented them from leaving their jobs. .Under pressure from groups such as the ILO, Qatar's government abolished the practice, but Amnesty International says companies still put pressure on labourers to stop them switching employers. .It warned that progress on labour reforms ""must not grind to a halt once the [World Cup] roadshow leaves Doha"". .Working in conjunction with the ILO, the Qatari government has introduced a number of reforms. .These include a wage protection scheme designed to ensure employers pay their staff on time. .A government spokesperson told the BBC its reforms are improving the working conditions of most foreign labourers in Qatar. .""Significant progress to ensure the reforms are effectively enforced has been made,"" said the spokesperson. .""The number of rule-breaking companies will continue to decline as enforcement measures take hold."" .The issue is likely to remain in the spotlight during the finals. .Fifa has written to the 32 teams competing telling them to ""now focus on the football"". It said the sport should not be ""dragged"" into ideological or political ""battles"", or ""hand out moral lessons"". .But in response, ten European football associations - including those of England and Wales - said that ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"". .The Australian football squad released a video criticising Qatar for mistreating migrant workers. .Danish players will wear a ""toned-down"" all-black kit to protest against Qatar's human rights' record.",136

You know what haram [forbidden] means?"" .When asked why it was haram, he added: ""I am not a strict Muslim but why is it haram? Because it is damage in the mind."" .The interview, which is part of a documentary set to be broadcast on Tuesday, was then stopped by an accompanying official. .Rasha Younes, LGBT rights senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ""Salman's suggestion that same-sex attraction is 'damage in the mind' is harmful and unacceptable. .""The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fuelling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices."" .There is concern about how LGBTQ+ people are treated in Qatar, where same-sex relationships and the promotion of same-sex relationships are criminalised, with punishments ranging from fines to the death sentence. .The host country's World Cup organisers have stated ""everyone is welcome"" to visit the country to watch the matches and claimed no-one will be discriminated against. .However, Qatar 2022 chief executive Nasser al Khater has said the government would not change its laws on homosexuality, requesting visitors ""respect our culture"". .The Gulf State, where the World Cup will take place from 20 November to 18 December, has also been criticised for its human rights record and treatment of migrant workers. .Fifa recently wrote to competing nations asking them to ""now focus on the football"" instead of the competition's controversial build-up. .The letter, which was signed by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, was criticised by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and LGBTQ+ campaigners in England and Wales, while 10 European football associations - including those of England and Wales - said ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"". .However, Conmebol, the South American football confederation, says it is ""time to leave controversies behind"". .LGBTQ+ campaign group All Out called on Fifa to ""end the silence and hypocrisy"" following Salman's comments. .At a protest outside Fifa's museum in Zurich, a spokesperson from All Out said: ""This comes days after All Out and others have presented testimony from LGBT+ Qataris of abduction, detention without trial, torture and conversion practices taking place in recent weeks. .""But Fifa president Infantino is still saying that everyone will be welcome at the World Cup. .""With just two weeks to go until the football starts, it is time for Fifa to stop looking away and take responsibility. .""It is time for Fifa to end the silence and hypocrisy.

It did not say how many personnel would be sent, and neither country has said that a final agreement has been reached. .""There may be perceptions on the part of the Qatari police or the supporting Turkish police, or any of the other agencies, about what supporters are doing,"" added Roberts. .""Just because people are noisy, bouncing up and down and chanting in a different language does not mean they're being aggressive."" .Statistics provided by the police show there were three arrests among more than 5,000 England fans who travelled to Russia for the 2018 World Cup, 15 arrests four years earlier in Brazil where more than 9,000 fans travelled, and seven arrests from more than 14,000 fans at South Africa in 2010. .Roberts said: ""You can see from the stats of previous World Cups, when people have to go to that effort and expense to get there, generally fans are going to go, watch the games and enjoy them."" .The Fifa event will be taking place in a Muslim country in the Middle East for the first time, and the consumption of alcohol is prohibited in Islam. .Fans will only be permitted to drink in the designated fan areas, one of which is a fan park which can hold up to 40,000 people and will show matches on big screens. .The other is a paid ticket event with DJ's which may not attract fans in numbers as the cheapest tickets are said to start from £75. .Ashley Brown from the Football Supporters Association (FSA) said many fans have been ""priced out"" of the World Cup with concerns also around the lack of accommodation available to supporters. .""There's a combination of reasons why people are being deterred,"" Brown said. .""For a lot of people Qatar doesn't sound like an exciting place to go, it's not a typical holiday destination, lack of alcohol availability, cost of getting there, cost when you're there, it's put a lot of people off."" .The World Cup is expected to attract more than one million visitors, but by March Qatar only had 30,000 hotel rooms, 80% of which had already been booked by Fifa for football teams, officials, and sponsors. .Organisers are offering shared rooms in empty apartments, villas, fan villages and traditional-style tents in the desert with two cruise ships being converted into floating hotels that will be moored at Doha's port. .Some fans are even opting to travel in from nearby Dubai. .Another point of contention for travelling fans has been the fact that homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and many gay fans have opted to boycott the tournament. .""It's very sad,"" said Brown. ""Three Lions Pride who represent that community as travelling England fans - I don't think any are going. .""They don't feel safe, they don't feel comfortable and they don't feel reassured and that is incredibly disappointing that Fifa can put a tournament in a country that won't welcome those people."" .Fans have also been encouraged by the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Alicia Kearns, to leave their personal phones at home and take burner phones instead to Qatar. This comes amid fears that apps you have to download in Qatar are being used to hack into people's phones. .""We heard the same for Russia and I'm not aware of any problems that were had in Russia,"" said Brown. .""I've been to Qatar twice, I've used my own phone, I've not had any issues.""",144

It took me three weeks to a month to try to go out because Paris is full of Algerians and people come to you to tell you: 'What's happened, how and why?',"" he told the BBC's World Football podcast. .""Those memories come back and it's hurting. .""It's going to be a trauma in my head because I'm 36 now and I still have a lot in the tank.

It's not just defaulting on a bad credit history as we do here in the UK."" .He said it was devastating to hear his ""big brother and best friend"" had been detained in Iraq. .""He was petrified,"" his brother said. ""He explained that they told him it was Interpol and he was on the red list for a warrant for his arrest from Qatar."" .He said bank salesmen would target expats in Qatari hotels offering loans with low interest rates. .""It looks like they want you to default,"" he said. ""Interest rates are extremely low but when you default they go through this process of doing this to families. .""They know that we are desperate. They know I would sell my house. I've already sold my car. .""My brother is getting treated like a crime lord.

The public will be just as happy in a bar."" .Calls for a boycott of the World Cup, which takes place between 21 November and 18 December, have been growing in France, though they remain far from mainstream. .The former international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona said he would not be watching any matches, adding: ""Let's be honest, this World Cup makes no sense.

He dismissed the verdict as ""nonsense"". .The governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates also accused Qaradawi of terrorism in 2017 as part of their justification for imposing a de facto blockade on Qatar.

159,65,25 September 2022,Qatar World Cup: Accommodation worries for football fans," .In the past 25 years, Paul Clegg has travelled to several countries to watch the England football team play. He has already ticked three World Cups off his list and is now gearing up for his fourth in Qatar. .Like the previous editions, he plans to track England's journey through the tournament and has purchased tickets for their matches all the way until the finals, if they qualify. .The only challenge for him is that he is not sure where he is going to sleep for most of the tournament. .""I've just booked a room for the first four nights and I am paying a lot for it. I haven't found any reasonably priced options, so I am not sure where will I be staying after that,"" he says. .Paul is not alone in his struggle - thousands of others are facing the same problem. .The BBC spoke to more than two dozen fans who still have not managed to book any accommodation. With less than two months to go, their concerns are growing. .The World Cup is expected to attract more than one million visitors, but by March Qatar only had 30,000 hotel rooms, 80% of which had already been booked by Fifa for football teams, officials, and sponsors. .To boost accommodation options, the organisers are offering shared rooms in empty apartments, villas, fan villages and traditional-style tents in the desert. .Two cruise ships are being converted into floating hotels that will be moored at Doha's port. All these measures are expected to add up to 70,000 rooms to the market. .In a statement to the BBC, the country's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said the Gulf state would deliver up to 130,000 rooms in time for the tournament. .""This is a comfortable inventory for fans, teams and sponsors travelling to the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022,"" it added. .Despite this announcement, accommodation options on the ground in Qatar are scant and expensive. .Refabricated cabins at so-called fan villages built in the desert on the outskirts of Doha are being sold as a budget option. They are priced at $207 (£184) per night and many fans say they are not worth the money. .Anas Filali, who is flying in from the United States, says there are no affordable options for budget travellers like him. .""Two hundred dollars for those cabins at the fan village... is just too expensive. Airbnb rooms are ridiculously priced too. I am hoping to find some cheaper options once I get there,"" he says. .The BBC requested access to visit the fan villages, but permission was declined by the authorities. The sites are reportedly still under construction. .Locals have been allowed to host fans at their homes, but at hefty prices. On the room-rental site Airbnb there are hardly any options for less than $200 a night. .Leo Caglilio, who is travelling from Australia with his brother-in-law, is paying $265 a night for a private room in a family home. He says he never faced the issue of finding an affordable room when he went to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup. .""This time it has been really stressful. We had been looking since April, but the price never really came down,"" he says. .Qatar is the smallest nation by land size ever to stage the World Cup. .The country has reportedly spent $200bn (£177bn) since it won the bid to host the tournament in 2010 to build infrastructure and stadiums. .The busiest period will be the group stage, when four matches a day will be played in stadiums in and around Doha. .Football's governing body, FIFA, says almost 2.5 million tickets out of a possible 3 million are already sold and an unprecedented 1.2 million people, equivalent to almost 40% of Qatar's population, are expected to visit. .The accommodation squeeze has forced thousands of fans to look for options outside Qatar, with many deciding to base themselves in neighbouring countries. .The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Oman will be operating daily shuttle flights to ferry fans to the host country. .Dubai has emerged as a popular destination, with demand for hotel rooms soaring ahead of the World Cup. The city will be operating almost 50 shuttle flights every day to Doha, which is less than an hour away by plane. .Simon Witney, a fan from the UK, is staying in Dubai and plans to travel to Doha only on matchdays. He says he is paying less than $100 a night for a ""much better room"" in an upmarket locality in the city. .""Despite the flight cost, I will be saving a substantial amount,"" he says. .The Dubai Sports Council estimates that about 1 million World Cup fans could arrive in the city - though some observers feel this target might be ambitious, considering Qatar is also expecting around the same number of visitors. .Despite the accommodation chaos, many fans like Paul hope to be able to stay in Qatar to make the most of their visit. .""I want to soak in the World Cup atmosphere,"" he says.

161,67,23 August 2022,Qatar deports migrant workers after wage protest," .Qatar has deported migrant workers who protested about unpaid wages, as the country prepares for the football World Cup in November. .At least 60 workers rallied outside Al Bandary International Group's Doha offices on 14 August - some reportedly had not been paid for seven months. .A number of protesters were detained and some were deported, although it's not known how many. .The government said those who were deported had ""breached security laws"". .Since Qatar was awarded the World Cup in 2010 - sparking a wave of construction of stadiums and infrastructure across the country - its treatment of migrant workers has been questioned. .The Al Bandary International Group company is predominantly a construction and engineering company. .It is not known whether the workers were involved in the World Cup preparations, and the organising committee declined to comment. .But in a statement to the BBC, the Qatari government confirmed that a number of workers who took part in the rare protest in Doha had been detained for breaching public security laws. .It is understood that a minority of those ""who failed to remain peaceful"" face deportation, and rights groups say some have already left the country. .The Qatari government said it would pay all delayed salaries and benefits to the affected workers. .The government said the Al Bandary group was already under investigation for not paying its workers, and further action is being taken after a deadline to settle payments had been missed. .The workers' case was highlighted by Equidem, a human rights organisation specialising in labour rights. .Its head, Mustafa Qadri, told the BBC: ""Have we all been duped by Qatar and FIFA? .""They've been telling us there's no moral quandary about holding the World Cup in Qatar, in a country which still punishes people for speaking their minds."" .The workers who protested were from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Egypt and the Philippines, according to Mr Qadri. .Mr Qadri - who has been in touch with several of workers - said some police officers told the protesters that, if they can strike in hot weather, they can sleep without air conditioning, too. .""Can you imagine how desperate the workers must have been to protest in 42 degrees? They aren't political actors, they just want to be paid for their labour,"" Mr Qadri added. .Earlier this year, BBC Arabic reported allegations that Qatar is under-reporting the number of migrant workers who have died of heat stroke. .FIFA, the organisation for international football, was earlier this year urged to set up a compensation fund of at least $440m (£350m) for migrant workers who have suffered ""human rights abuses"" .A spokesperson for the government's World Cup organising committee declined to comment on the Al Bandary protest. The Al Bandary group did not respond to a request for comment. .The Qatari government said 96% of eligible workers in Qatar are covered by a wage protection system, which obliges employers to transfer all wages through Qatari banks within seven days of their due date, and that gaps in the system were being identified. .Life at 50C: Qatar accused of under-reporting deaths in Gulf's killer heat .Qatar accused of under-reporting heat deaths.

This particular target has a 9 ft. wingspan, and a 25lbs take off weight, (similar to Russian Orlan 10). #newproduct #chute #drones #dronetechnology pic.twitter.com/qdjoyNeq3h .Targets are identified using a ""series of very small radars that are distributed throughout the venue, creating a complete picture of the airspace straight up into the air"", Fortem chief executive and co-founder Timothy Bean told the BBC. .The company claims the drones have had ""live kills"" at various security sites around the world. .But the roar of fans will not be accompanied by the buzz of drones because the machines do their work ""a mile or so away from the venue"", Mr Bean added. .Alternative systems for stopping drones can rely on interfering with the drone's control signals, but Fortem argues terrorists may launch drones on pre-programmed flight paths. .""The reason our business is skyrocketing is because terrorists don't use joysticks. Terrorists don't show up in your parking lot with a joystick. These drones are programmed ... so they can't be jammed,"" Mr Bean says. .The company says it has deployed anti-drone systems at other sporting events and at the World Economic Forum meeting at Davos. It has donated portable versions of its system to Ukraine, and said it was also working on anti-drone measures for UK airports. .The Utah-based firm, which has received backing from Toshiba and Boeing, will work for the Qatari Ministry of Interior and Safety and Security Operations Committee at the World Cup in November and December. .Prof David Dunn, of University of Birmingham, says that the threat from terrorist use of drones has increased, because the technology has become more accessible. .He cites the unsuccessful attempt by suicide bombers, during the terrorist attacks on Paris in 2015, to gain access to the Stade de France, where France were playing Germany in a football friendly. .A drone might have been able to enter the stadium, he suggests, where ground-based terrorists could not. .Dr Steve Wright, from University of the West of England, also thinks concerns have been heightened partially because commercial drones have been modified into weapons in conflicts in Yemen and Ukraine. .He believes that systems like Fortem's can be effective against a threat from smaller drones. .Dr Wright, who is working on a similar system for a European company, believes that they expand the line of defence outwards from a venue, giving defenders more time to respond. .But he warns these are one step in an arms race and says that as attacking drones increase in speed, they will be harder to stop. .""We're looking at technologies of how we can push that out 200mph (322km/h), maybe even 300mph one day, as we squeeze the sponge of the electric technology we've got,"" he said. .And attackers may make drones more manoeuvrable. Dr Wright said his team had built a drone that could accelerate so fast it was like going from zero to 60mph (97km/h) in under a second. .So-called ""swarms"" of multiple attacking drones would also present a challenge. Dr Wright said in the conflict with Yemen, ""the Saudis are already seeing that problem starting to crop up as groups of these things are sent over the border simultaneously"". .But by requiring attackers to employ countermeasures, all drone defence systems make attacks harder, and so reduce the likelihood of one taking place. .""If your countermeasure is defeated, it doesn't necessarily mean that the countermeasure is pointless.

164,70,12 July 2022,Gary Speed: Wales manager's mother talks about his death," .Gary Speed's mother is urging people to open up about their mental health .Gary Speed's mother has spoken at length about the sadness that ""never goes away,"" more than a decade after the ex-footballer took his own life. .The former Wales manager was found dead at his home in November 2011. .He was widely credited with reigniting Welsh football fortunes and setting them on the road to the 2022 World Cup. .His mother Carol said she would never find the answer to why he died but urged others to talk about their mental health - and get help. .""It's just something that you don't ever get over at all,"" she said, speaking openly about the former Leeds, Newcastle and Everton midfielder in one of the first public interviews since he died. .""You know, you can smile and you can laugh, and you can have a good day, but it's always there. The sadness is always there."" .Now retired, Carol Speed still shares the modest semi-detached home in Deeside, Flintshire, where the Welsh sporting giant grew up with her husband Roger, Speed's father. .Roger now lives with dementia, and Carol cares for him. They both still treasure the memories of their son captured in scores of photos, shirts and pennants adorning walls around the house. .It is a shrine to a footballing star who was loved by both his family and fans, but will always remain 42. .Outside, Carol has been joking about how a young Gary would constantly kick a ball against the garage door, so hard he broke it. .The lush green lawn at the back of the house was once worn bare by the teen's kickabouts. .Not much more than a stone's throw from their front door stands the playground and field that marks Aston Park, where Speed honed his footballing skills with schoolmates. .Today, a stone plinth and bench mark a memorial to Queensferry's lost hero. .At an inquest 10 years ago, the coroner said he could not be satisfied Speed had intended to kill himself. .He left behind his wife Louise and two sons, Tommy and Ed, who were just teenagers when he died. .For Carol, questions about the death still haunt her. .""I'll never find the answer to why. That makes it doubly hard to live with,"" she said. .""You know, if people are ill and they die, then you know why, but we didn't. We just didn't know with Gary. .""No answers whatsoever - no. And that's hard - that's hard. Because we didn't have any idea he was feeling like that. .""He never showed it. He was always smiling. .""We couldn't keep an eye on him, because we didn't think there was anything wrong."" .In words perhaps only a mother could utter, she added: ""If I'd had been there that evening it wouldn't have happened. No way - no way. .""Gary wasn't short of money, he had a nice house, a nice family - a job that he absolutely adored. So, if it can happen to someone like him, it can happen to anyone, can't it?"" .The death of Gary Speed was marked by a national outpouring of grief, from supporters at his former clubs - Leeds, Newcastle, Everton, and Bolton - and, of course, the Wales national team. .""He'd only just gone to Sheffield United, so I was shocked when he took the Welsh job,"" recalled Carol. .""He said: 'You don't turn your country down', you know. .""I'm just glad he did well with them, for the short time he was with them."" .She said while the entire family still struggles with the loss of the footballer, the support from fans a decade on remains ""unbelievable"". .""People are remembered on sort of anniversaries of their death and things like that, but there's always something going on about Gary. It is very touching. .""We always thought he was a good lad, he was our lad and we thought he was wonderful - but so did everybody else. .""I can't believe that people are still talking about him, really."" .However, it has taken Carol over a decade to be able to watch football again. She said she could always envisage her son on the pitch or touchline, and that had been unbearable. .""I couldn't watch football at all for 10 years and didn't want to know about football at all,"" said Carol. .""I'm enjoying it again now. I don't know whether I blamed football - I don't know."" .It means she will be closely following Wales' progress as the side heads to Qatar for the World Cup. .""When I first started watching Wales again, it felt a bit strange, but I'm past that now,"" she added. .Carol was also certain how her son would feel about qualification: ""He'd be over the moon. He'd be really, really into it, he would. I think that was his goal really. .""He wanted to get them there, definitely."" .It will be 11 years since his death when Wales walk out for their Group B games in Qatar in November, with the anniversary falling between matches against Iran and England. .Speed's mother said discussions around mental health, especially for men, had undergone an important change since his death. .""It was never spoken about. It never even crossed my mind. I couldn't believe it when Gary did what he did. I was just numb. .""But it seems to have been all brought out since Gary, and people are not frightened to talk about it anymore."" .She said the message was simple: ""Speak to someone even though it's hard. .""Because they had no idea what it does to the family. It just breaks people up, completely. .""It certainly has, our life. It's ruined our life completely."" .Additional reporting by Peter Gillibrand .If you have been affected by any of the issues raised here, or you or someone you know is feeling emotionally distressed, you can access advice and support through BBC Action Line. .Mural tribute to former Wales manager Gary Speed .FAW to continue 'Speed legacy' with new strategy .Gary Speed's death: A day that shook football .Speed always in Wales' thoughts - Allen .Speed death 'may be accidental' .Speed's family statement in full .Wales football boss Speed dies",164

175,81,7 June 2022,World Cup 2022: LGBT Wales fans vow to boycott Qatar tournament," .Some Wales football fans are to boycott the Fifa World Cup in Qatar due to the host country's stance on gay rights. .Wales qualified for the tournament for the first time in 64 years after winning their play-off final against Ukraine. .However Tracy Brown, of Wales' official LGBTQ+ supporters' group, said many members did not believe it was safe to travel to the Middle East in November. .Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable with prison sentences. .In the Senedd on Tuesday First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales should ""not look the other way"" from human rights concerns in Qatar. .Ms Brown, from the Rainbow Wall supporters' group, said: ""I, for one, won't go. .""On one hand I'm stoked that we've got there, it's been a long time coming. .""If it was anywhere else in the world I would be thinking I want to be there supporting. .""But I'm going to be sat at home watching us play, because I don't feel safe to go."" .Equality campaign group Kick It Out previously announced the formation of a working group to look at inclusivity issues in Qatar. .Fatma Al-Nuaimi, communications executive director of Qatar's supreme committee for organising the tournament, told BBC Sport: ""It's a tournament for everyone, a tournament of firsts, and a tournament where everyone will be welcome."" .2022 World Cup chief Hassan Al Thawadi tells Dan Roan hosts ""ready to welcome the world"" .But Ms Brown said that had not convinced her, or others, to change their mind. .""Just saying it's safe while a competition is on doesn't seem right,"" she said. .""So Fifa said you're safe to be yourself for the period of the World Cup, but when I leave there's still an LGBTQ+ community who pretty much live in hiding. .""They're not safe and I have to stand by my values. .""I want to go to a country where I feel safe and welcome all the time."" .At first minister's questions in the Welsh Parliament Mark Drakeford said: ""We should not look the other way from reservations that we would have as a nation from some of those human rights issues that we see there."" .He said Economy Minister Vaughan Gething raised human rights issues with Qatari authorities when he visited in May. .""We must ourselves make sure that those opportunities are not missed while the eyes of the world are on that country,"" he added. .The decision by Fifa to host the World Cup in the country has been widely criticised, with Qatar's wider record on human rights also under scrutiny. .Amnesty International have also been critical of Qatar's record on gay rights, as well as its treatment of migrant workers. .Felix Jakens, head of campaigns at Amnesty International UK, said the organisation had ""multiple concerns"". .""This is a time when footballers in our own country are finally coming out as gay, where there's more acceptance around LGBT people's participation,"" he said. .""It's shocking that the World Cup is being held in a country where being gay is criminalised."" .The Independent newspaper's international editor, David Harding, worked as a journalist in Qatar for four years. .He said supporters who were planning to go to the World Cup would need to be prepared for a very different experience to previous international events. .""People will have to modify their behaviour. That is just a given, you're going to a very strict, conservative, religious country,"" he said. .Mr Harding said he was confident most LGBTQ+ supporters who chose to go to Qatar would not encounter serious problems, with authorities eager to avoid controversy. .""The LGBTQ community in Qatar are very angry at what Fifa and Qatari officials are doing,"" he said. .""In effect, they're saying for three weeks we'll go easy, we won't do anything, and then we'll treat Qatari LGBTQ people as bad as we treat them all the time once the World Cup is over. .""There will be some crunch points, if people wave flags or start a protest. I think these sorts of things could lead to problems. The police will not take your side if they feel you are breaking the law"". .Ms Brown said she did not know of any LGBTQ+ supporters from the UK who planned to travel. .""Some of my friends are part of [England's official LGBTQ+ supporters' group] the Three Lions Pride Group and they are also having the exact same conversations,"" she said. .""The vast majority of us wouldn't feel safe. .""I feel like we're missing out on a huge competition because we're choosing to be our authentic selves."" .Q&A: Wales at the World Cup in Qatar .How did Wales celebrate World Cup qualification? .Coming out as gay a relief - Blackpool's Daniels .Qatar security guards subjected to 'forced labour' .What can fans expect at the Qatar World Cup?",175
176,82,7 June 2022,Nupur Sharma: Prophet Muhammad remarks deepen India’s diplomatic crisis," .India's diplomatic nightmare over controversial comments made by two senior officials of the country's ruling party about the Prophet Muhammad is showing no signs of ending. .The UAE, Oman, Indonesia, Iraq, the Maldives, Jordan, Libya and Bahrain have joined the growing list of countries in the Islamic world that have condemned the remarks. Earlier, Kuwait, Iran and Qatar had called Indian ambassadors to register their protest, and Saudi Arabia had issued a strongly worded statement. .Indian diplomats have been trying to placate these countries - it shares cordial relations with most of them - but the storm is far from over. .At the centre of this controversy is Nupur Sharma, who was a spokesperson of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She made the remark in a televised debate last month, and videos of her statement had gone viral. Naveen Jindal, who was media head of the party's Delhi unit, had also posted a provocative tweet on the issue. .Critics say Ms Sharma and Mr Jindal's comments reflect the deep religious polarisation that the country has been witnessing over the past few years. Hate speech and attacks against Muslims have risen sharply since the BJP came to power in 2014. .Their comments - especially Ms Sharma's - angered the country's minority Muslim community, leading to sporadic protests in some states. The BBC is not repeating Ms Sharma's remarks as they are offensive in nature. .The two leaders have issued public apologies and the party has suspended Ms Sharma and expelled Mr Jindal. .""The BJP strongly denounces insults of any religious personalities of any religion. The BJP is also against any ideology which insults or demeans any sect or religion. The BJP does not promote such people or philosophy,"" it said in a statement. .But experts say that the BJP's response may not be enough after what looked like the country's internal matter took an international turn. The anger in the Islamic world is evident from some of the statements from these countries. .Qatar said it expected a public apology from India. .""Allowing such Islamophobic remarks to continue without punishment, constitutes a grave danger to the protection of human rights and may lead to further prejudice and marginalisation, which will create a cycle of violence and hate,"" Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs said. .Saudi Arabia also used some strong words in its statement. ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its condemnation and denunciation of the statements made by the spokeswoman of the BJP,"" it said. .India's ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, said the remarks from some ""fringe elements"" did not represent the views of the Indian government. Senior BJP leaders and other diplomats have also condemned the controversial statement. .The 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and Pakistan have also criticised India. But Delhi criticised both, as it usually does, saying their comments were ""unwarranted and narrow-minded"". .Analysts say that the top leadership of the party and the government may have to make public statements on the issue. Not doing so, they say, runs the risk of damaging India's ties with the Arab world and Iran. .India's trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, stood at $87 billion in 2020-21. Millions of Indians live and work in these countries and send millions of dollars in remittances back home. The region is also the top source for India's energy imports. .Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a regular visitor to the region since coming to power in 2014. The country has already signed a free trade agreement with the UAE and is in talks with the GCC for a wider deal. .Mr Modi famously attended the ground-breaking ceremony of the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi in 2018 - it was termed as an example of the growing ties between India and the region. .Against this backdrop, the UAE's decision to join the chorus against India is quite significant. The relations between the two countries have significantly improved in the past few years. The UAE has also backed India at multi-nation forums. .Experts said the controversy could overshadow some of India's recent diplomatic successes with the UAE and other nations. .While Delhi's relations with Tehran have been lukewarm over the past few years, the controversy could overshadow Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian's upcoming visit to India. .Another former diplomat Anil Trigunayat, who has served in the Arab world, said that India was in a difficult situation and only sincere efforts at the leadership level could prevent negative fallout. .Other analysts say the diplomatic cost from the fallout could greatly hurt India's interests in the region. .""Indian officials often react defensively when foreign capitals, including close friends of New Delhi, criticise Indian domestic matters. But in this case, expect Indian diplomats to work quickly to defuse tensions with apologies and other forms of damage control,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center think-tank. .Arab nations are also looking to take concrete action to soothe anger among their own people. Hashtags criticising India have been trending in these countries and the incident has been the top story in their media outlets. .Some of these hashtags have called for a boycott of Indian products. There have also been reports of some stores in Qatar and Kuwait removing Indian products from their shelves. A sign in Arabic at the Al-Ardiya Co-Operative Society supermarket in Kuwait read: ""We have removed Indian products."" .But analysts, including Mr Kugelman, believe that despite the public display of anger, the relationship was important to both the GCC and India and both sides would be looking at mitigating the risks. .""As concerned as Delhi should be about this angry response from such a strategically critical region, India is also shielded from further damage by its own clout. Because of their economic interests, Gulf states need India to keep importing their energy, they need Indians to continue living and working there, and overall, they need to keep doing business with India,"" he said. .He added that there might be limits to how far these countries would go in responding to these anti-Muslim comments. .Critics say that religious polarisation has increased in India since the BJP came to power. And the past few weeks have been particularly tense after some Hindu groups went to a local court in Varanasi to seek permission to pray at a centuries-old mosque, claiming that it was built on the ruins of a demolished temple. .TV channels have held provocative debates and social media has seen rampant hate over the issue. Many people associated with right-wing organisations often make controversial statements on TV shows, but critics say Ms Sharma wasn't a ""fringe element"" as the BJP has claimed. She was an official spokesperson of the party, tasked with representing the BJP's views. .Analysts add that the international fallout over the controversy should be a wake-up call for India and it should learn that divisive politics can have international ramifications. .""Delhi is learning that when it comes to the country's increasingly toxic politics, what happens in India often doesn't stay in India. As India's global clout grows and its diplomatic and economic partnerships abroad become stronger, there's more at stake when its domestic politics cause unhappiness abroad,"" Mr Kugelman said. .The Indian woman who started Prophet Muhammad row .How India and US agreed to differ on Ukraine war .Why India is not criticising Russia over Ukraine",176
177,83,6 June 2022,World Cup 2022: Wales manager's pride at qualification," .Fans erupt with joy as Wales finally qualify for the World Cup .Wales' manager has spoken of his pride at the ""monumental"" achievement for the nation after qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in 64 years. .They beat Ukraine 1-0 in Cardiff in a tense and dramatic game after Gareth Bale's deflected free-kick. .Rob Page told his players that he ""loves them to bits"". .As the reality of Sunday's achievement sank in, many jubilant fans on Monday said they thought they would never see this moment. .Wales will share Group B with USA, Iran and England at the tournament in Qatar, starting in November. .""Even at the final whistle last night I was thinking... is this a cruel dream that I'm having?"" Page told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""But then you realise that it's reality. .""It's one of those surreal moments when you wake up and then realise that we are off to the World Cup. It is unbelievable."" .Wales have reached the World Cup only once before - in 1958 under Jimmy Murphy's management. Remarkably, both Murphy and Page are from Rhondda in the south Wales valleys, and grew up only a few miles apart. .""How spooky is that?"" said Page. ""Two people from the Rhondda: it was written in the stars, wasn't it? It's a special moment for me and my family."" .He called the win ""massive"" for the country, adding: ""We've seen the tide has turned slightly with regards to football and rugby. .""I think football has become our number one sport. We'll always be known for rugby, of course we will, but this is massive - it's monumental what we've done."" .World Cup 2022: Fans' joy as Wales qualify for Qatar finals .Page also paid tribute to Gary Speed, who died in 2011 while Wales manager. Speed is often credited with having laid the foundations for the nation's current success, and Page said Sunday's match was for him and his family. .That sentiment was echoed by former Wales manager Chris Coleman, who led Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016. .""He [Speed] put a lot of things in place. I know I benefited from that, I'm sure Ryan Giggs and Pagey did too,"" he said. .Ffion Owen, who watched the game in Cardiff, said: ""I don't think I had any more to cry, it was euphoria, it was a dream that you can't imagine happening until it happens."" .Rhodri Ogwen Williams, who lives in Qatar, said it was an emotional moment for him after he lost his father last year. .""I believe my dad's spirit was in (goalkeeper) Wayne Hennessey's hands last night. It was a beautiful, beautiful moment."" .Rhodri, a sports broadcaster, said many Welsh fans were watching the game from his restaurant and ""everybody is so welcome"" to Qatar. .""The Wales fans are going to have the time of their life,"" he added. .""It was amazing... it was fab,"" said Chelsea Wadeson, of Wrexham. .""I don't think we'll be going to Qatar but we'll definitely be watching them. We were so chuffed."" .Phil Higgins, from Wrexham, said watching the game was ""fabulous"". .""It's great isn't it, but a bit unexpected as well. They hung in there and obviously the crowd was a big factor."" .For Gaynor Williams, travelling to Qatar is out of the question, but her sons who are avid Wales supporters may take the trip. .""It's fantastic, 64 years since they've done it. Brilliant. Well done to them, they deserve it."" .The victory was also marked with sympathy for Ukraine and their fans. Ukraine had hoped to make the final step to the World Cup after reaching the play-off via a 3-1 win over Scotland last Wednesday in their first competitive clash since Russia's invasion. .But their hopes were crushed after several missed chances and a standout performance by the Wales keeper. .Reasons to be cheerful - part 2!

Details are expected soon. .Some lucky fans will already have tickets allocated if successful in the Fifa ballot, which was open to everyone but was more than five times over-subscribed. .Ticket prices for first round matches range from about £50 to £171. .Some Welsh fans have already expressed concern that they will be out-priced and that fewer than 2,500 tickets could be available for some games. .Fans will need an ID card - a Hayya card - which will also act as a visa to get into Qatar, as well as a fan ID, to get into games. The card will also cover free travel on public transport on match days, including bus, metro and the tram - which directly links central Doha with the stadium. .Accommodation will have to be arranged before travelling out. Tournament organisers say it will include hotels, apartments, villas, fan villages and cruise ship cabins, with official accommodation starting from $100 per room per night. .Flights normally take six hours and 40 minutes from London, but there will be charter flights from Cardiff organised by Wales travel operators. .The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says local laws and customs are ""very different"". There is normally a ban on drinking alcohol or being drunk in public places, which carry sentences of up to six months in jail. .You can't buy alcohol in shops either. However, alcohol is allowed inside licensed bars and hotels and is expected to be available in fan zones. .Qatar is still finalising its policy towards alcohol for the World Cup but there is already a warning that its availability, and the laws around it will be different to previous tournaments. .Swearing or obscene gestures also carry penalties, including deportation. There is a recommendation to dress modestly in public. There are also serious consequences for anyone caught with drugs. .Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and there has been concern over safety from LGBTIQ+ groups despite discussions with Fifa. .The currency is the Qatari Riyal and the exchange rate is currently around 4.6 for every pound. Things can be expensive in some places so the advice is to shop around. A bottle of non-alcoholic beer could set you back the equivalent of about £10. .November temperatures can hit a high of 30C but are generally in the 20s. The reason the tournament has been switched to the winter is because of the searing heat of the summer months in this part of the world. .Celebrations as Wales end 64-year World Cup wait .Wales edge Ukraine to end 64-year World Cup wait .What can fans expect at the Qatar World Cup? .Qatar security guards subjected to 'forced labour'",179

He came to me: ""Coach, we will have nine minutes"" - like something he negotiated with me.

He was sentenced to five years in prison. .Ibhais was taken into custody by police on 15 November, reportedly just before he was due to be interviewed by two journalists from Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. The journalists were later detained themselves by Qatari security forces for more than 30 hours for allegedly trespassing on private property and filming without a permit. .Ibhais went on hunger strike in prison while awaiting his appeal. .""For me this was the last resort after I was denied a chance for a fair trial. I was denied the chance to be heard. I was denied the chance to speak up,"" he said in an audio message released by the Dutch newspaper NRC on 2 December in which he denied any wrongdoing. .On Wednesday, Qatar's Court of Appeal upheld his conviction but reduced his sentence to three years. Ibhais was not in court for the hearing, which one journalist who attended said lasted less than a minute. .A Qatari official said the case ""followed all the proper legal procedures and protocols"" and that the evidence against him ""included extensive details of the crime - much more than the defendant's own confession"". .""The State of Qatar rejects in the strongest possible terms any assertion that the ruling was influenced by factors other than its unwavering commitment to justice and the rule of law."" .The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said the allegations that the case was linked to Ibhais' views on migrant workers were ""ludicrous, defamatory, and absolutely false"". .Nicholas McGeehan, co-director of FairSquare, said: ""Every day Abdullah Ibhais remains in jail more people will know his name, know what he did for the migrant workers who built Qatar's World Cup, and know the price he has apparently paid for that."" .""It was Qatar's World Cup organisers who instigated this prosecution, but it was Fifa's silence that enabled today's verdict,"" he added. .A Fifa spokesperson said any person deserved a fair trial that observed and respected due process, and that it would ""consider today's ruling before making any further comment"". .You might also be interested in: .Kenyan blogger: 'I thought I may never make it out of Qatar'",186

The Islamic State group said it was behind the attack. .Speaking after the talks with the US opened in Qatar, Afghanistan's Taliban-appointed Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the two sides had agreed to uphold the terms of the Doha agreement signed in 2020. .The deal includes broad obligations on the Taliban to take steps to prevent groups such as al-Qaeda from threatening the security of the US and its allies. .Mr Muttaqi said US officials had also told the Taliban they would help in delivering Covid vaccines and humanitarian aid. .The US has not yet commented on the details of Saturday's talks, but a state department spokesperson previously said officials would use the meeting to press the Taliban to respect women's rights, form an inclusive government and allow humanitarian agencies to operate. .The meeting is set to continue on Sunday. .Mr Muttaqi told reporters that the Islamist group wanted to improve relations with the international community but also warned that nobody should interfere with any country's internal policies. .American officials have said the talks are a continuation of engagement with the Taliban on matters of national interest, not about giving legitimacy to the group's government. .As the talks were taking place in the Qatari capital Doha, in Afghanistan funeral ceremonies were being held for the victims of Friday's attack. .""[We] bury the bodies next to each other because we have no choice, and we have to prepare mass graves,"" one mourner said. .The United Nations said Friday's bombing was a ""third deadly attack this week apparently targeting a religious institution"" and was part of a ""disturbing pattern of violence"". .Pictures show the scene at the mosque after the suicide bomb attack .Scene after Kunduz mosque suicide bomb attack.

193,99,5 October 2021,Pandora Papers: Qatar ruling family avoided £18.5m tax on London super-mansion," .The Qatar ruling family bought two of the UK's most expensive houses in a deal that allowed them to avoid £18.5m in stamp duty, leaked documents show. .The family bought the properties in central London via offshore companies for over £120m and applied to make them into a 17-bedroom ""super-mansion"". .There is no suggestion that either the Qatari family or the sellers of the two properties acted illegally. .The Qatari government did not respond to questions about the BBC's findings. .The freehold of the properties is owned by the Crown Estate, the Queen's property empire that is managed by the Treasury and raises cash for the UK. It said ""given the issues raised"" it was now looking into the matter. .The leaked documents were part of the Pandora Papers. More than 600 journalists including BBC News Arabic have been trawling through the files from 14 sources for months. .In 2013, the British media reported Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser, wife of the then-Emir of Qatar, bought 1 Cornwall Terrace in London for £80m, making it the most expensive terraced property ever to be sold in the UK. Neighbouring 2-3 Cornwall Terrace was purchased for £40m. .Cornwall Terrace is believed to be the most expensive row of houses anywhere in the world. Facing Regent's Park, they were designed and built in the early 1800s by the renowned Georgian architects, James and Decimus Burton and John Nash, who also designed the park. .Following the purchases, the ruling family then attempted in 2015 to knock both properties into a single ""super-mansion"", with 17 bedrooms, 14 lounges, a cinema, a juice bar and a swimming pool. .Their application was rejected by Westminster council on the basis of a lack of residential housing in the borough, but a second application in 2020 appears to have been granted. .However, the new leaked documents reveal the properties were purchased via shell companies based in offshore tax havens and, by doing so, the ruling family avoided an estimated £18.5m Stamp Duty Land Tax when the leaseholds changed hands. .The documents show the ruling family registered a new offshore company called Golden Satalite to purchase 1 Cornwall Terrace, rather than in the name of a member of the family. As the property was already owned by a shell company, the family purchased the shares of this company and acquired the property as if it was an asset. .The Crown Estate last sold the leasehold for 1 Cornwall Terrace in 2005 for £21m. The house was subsequently sold on through an offshore company for £84m. This meant that unlike a normal house sale, neither HMRC nor the Crown Estate received any revenue or even notification of the sale. .Similarly, number 2-3 Cornwall Terrace was acquired through the purchase of a shell company created to own the leasehold. .Both shell companies are owned by Tharb, set up in Qatar and ultimately owned by the private office of the country's ruler, the Emir, Tamim Al Thani. .If the properties themselves had been purchased using the name of an individual from the Qatari royal family, it could have triggered stamp duty. Changes in UK tax law mean the properties would also now be liable to a 40% inheritance tax. .These property-owning shell companies are known as ""special purpose vehicles"" (SPVs) and are commonly used in tax avoidance. .Using company structures that fall outside of stamp duty in this manner is often a contentious issue. The HMRC says it cannot comment on identifiable taxpayers but that tax avoidance goes against ""the spirit of the law"". .Jonathan Benton, a former senior detective and an expert in international finance, said SPVs are frequently being used to purchase high-value properties in the UK. .""If property tax is avoided it is unfair. This type of action also contributes to the veil of secrecy offshore companies provide, and flies in the face of the broader global push for greater transparency."" .Property tax experts point out there have been changes to tax laws which make it less attractive for overseas buyers to use offshore companies as they now have to pay capital gains tax and inheritance tax, as well as a tax that applies to companies that own properties. .Further analysis of the Pandora Papers by the BBC reveals there are numerous other property assets owned by the Qatar royal family in the UK through offshore companies, with an estimated value of over £650m, though it is unclear whether these purchases involved tax avoidance. .The UK government has made repeated pledges to introduce legislation making it compulsory to name those owning real estate via foreign companies in a bid to stamp out money-laundering. .A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""These are novel measures, and it is essential that the register strikes the right balance between improving transparency and minimising burdens on legitimate commercial activity and the government will legislate when Parliamentary time allows."" .Additional reporting by Sam Piranty .The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires.

197,103,2 September 2021,Afghanistan: Qatar and Turkey become Taliban's lifeline to the outside world," .The Taliban's celebratory gunfire crackled over Kabul as the West pulled out this week. But militancy alone is likely to leave the Taliban on its own - globally isolated, with millions of Afghans facing an even more uncertain future. .The world's powers are now scrambling to exert influence amid the return of the country's Islamist rulers. And in the process two nations from the Arab and Muslim world have been emerging as key mediators and facilitators - Qatar and Turkey. .Both are capitalising on a recent history of access to the Taliban. Both eye opportunities. But both are taking a gamble too - which could even stoke old rivalries further afield, in the Middle East. .Officials in the small, gas-rich state of Qatar in the Gulf have provided the lifeline for countries trying to exit. .""No-one has been able to do any major evacuation process out of Afghanistan without having a Qatari involved in some way or another,"" explains Dina Esfandiary, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, a think tank which studies global conflict. .""Afghanistan and the Taliban will be a significant victory for [Qatar], not just because it will show that they're able to mediate with the Taliban, but it makes them a serious player for the Western countries that are involved,"" she told the BBC. .As Western countries fled Kabul, the diplomatic value of these contacts surged. The Twitter feed of Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Lolwah Alkhater, reads like a conveyer belt of retweeted tributes from world powers. .""Qatar… continues to be a trusted mediator in this conflict,"" she wrote earlier this month. .But bridging a trail to the Taliban may still contain risks for the future, including the capacity to aggravate one of the Middle East's fault lines. Turkey and Qatar are closer to the region's Islamist movements, which frequently creates tension with powers like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who see such groups as an existential threat. .If the two states are strengthened by doing the world's diplomacy with the Taliban in South Asia, could the ripples travel to the Middle East? .Dina Esfandiary says the Taliban's surge back to power constitutes a renewed swing towards Islamism - a political ideology that seeks to reorder government and society in accordance with Islamic law - but she says for now it remains contained to South Asia. .""It is for Afghanistan, it doesn't mean it's the case for the [Middle East]. Over the course of the last 10 years the region has gone back and forth non-stop between Islamist groups and non-Islamist groups,"" she says. .During the Taliban's original spell in power in the 1990s only three countries had formal ties with them: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. .The latter two cut all remaining official relations after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. However, covert funding from Saudi individuals reportedly went on for years afterwards. Saudi officials have previously denied the existence of any formal funding to the Taliban and said there are stringent measures to stop private cashflows. .But as the presence of US troops in Afghanistan became more unpopular among Americans, the door opened to states who could do the diplomacy. .For Qatar and Turkey, contact with the Taliban developed in different ways. .As President Barack Obama's administration sought to end the war, Qatar hosted Taliban leaders to discuss peace efforts from 2011. .It has been a controversial and chequered process. The sight of a Taliban flag fluttering in the glittery Doha suburbs offended many (they shortened the flagpole after an American request). For the Qataris it helped develop a three-decades-long ambition for an autonomous foreign policy - which it sees as crucial for a nation that sits between the regional poles of Iran and Saudi Arabia. .The Doha talks culminated in last year's deal under President Donald Trump for an American pull-out of Afghanistan by May this year. After taking office, Joe Biden announced that he was extending the deadline for a full withdrawal until 11 September. .Turkey, which has strong historical and ethnic ties in Afghanistan, has been on the ground with non-combat troops as the only Muslim-majority member of the Nato alliance there. .According to analysts, it has developed close intelligence ties with some Taliban-linked militia. Turkey is also an ally of neighbouring Pakistan, from whose religious seminaries the Taliban first emerged. .Last week, Turkish officials held talks with the Taliban lasting over three hours, as chaos gripped Kabul airport. Some of the discussions were about the future operation of the airport itself, which Turkish troops have guarded for six years. The Taliban had already insisted Turkey's military leave along with all other foreign forces to end Afghanistan's ""occupation"". But last week's meeting appeared to be part of a broader agenda, analysts say. .President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he viewed messages from Taliban leaders with ""cautious optimism"". He added that he would ""not get permission from anyone"" about who to talk to, when asked about criticism over contact with the group. .""This is diplomacy,"" he said during a press conference. .He added: ""Turkey is ready to lend all kinds of support for Afghanistan's unity but will follow a very cautious path."" .Prof Ahmet Kasim Han, an expert on Afghan relations at Istanbul's Altinbas University, believes dealing with the Taliban provides President Erdogan with an opportunity. .""To make their grip on power sustainable, the Taliban need international aid and investment to go on. The Taliban are not even able to pay for the salaries of their government employees today,"" he told the BBC. .He says Turkey may try to position itself as ""guarantor, mediator, facilitator"" - as a more trusted intermediary than Russia or China - who have kept their embassies open in Kabul. .""Turkey can serve that role,"" he says. .Many countries have attempted to maintain some form of contact with the Taliban since its take-over of Kabul, particularly through the Doha channel. But Turkey is among those in a stronger position to develop ties on the ground; albeit a situation that is full of risk. .Prof Han also believes further ties in Afghanistan allow President Erdogan to ""broaden the chessboard"" of his foreign policy and play to his AK Party's support base. .""They consider Turkey as a country with a manifest destiny - an exceptional position within the Muslim world. It is based on Turkey's past and its Ottoman heritage as the seat of the caliphate."" .""However, if that role amounts to a point where any country including Turkey becomes the sponsor... establishing a Sharia regime which is brutal in its practices... Turkey should not want itself there,"" he adds. .Mr Erdogan's move reportedly has more ""rational"" motives too - by improving Turkey's strained relations with the US and Nato, and building influence to prevent flows of Afghan refugees to Turkey. .As for Qatar, officials will hope its role as a mediator will diminish, rather than aggravate, years of turbulence in the Gulf. .Doha has brokered negotiations between competing factions in several of the Middle East's major conflicts. But in the wake of Arab Spring, its Gulf rivals accused it of siding with Islamists. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties - since restored - accusing Qatar of getting too close to Iran and fuelling instability via its state-owned news channel Al Jazeera; claims it rejected. .For now, with a deeply uncertain situation for the people of Afghanistan, Qatar and Turkey are among those talking to the Taliban for many in the outside world; while China and Russia also compete for future access in Kabul. .Prof Han says this amounts to a least worst option, what he calls the most ""collaborative approach"". .""Turkey, being a member of the West, is more susceptible to pressure from the West over [human rights] issues,"" he says. .The ripples from the Taliban's take-over have only just begun. The lives of millions of ordinary Afghans depend on how they spread out. .Nine Afghan robotics team members safe in Qatar",197
198,104,1 September 2021,Gulf Sky: 'Our ship was hijacked and taken to Iran'," .In July 2020, the oil tanker Gulf Sky vanished from waters off the United Arab Emirates, along with its crew. Days later it turned up in Iran where it's now suspected to be working as a ""ghost ship"" - helping the regime ferry oil in breach of sanctions. For the first time, eight former crew have spoken to the BBC about the ship's disappearance, saying they were hijacked by a group of armed men. All but the captain have asked not to be named, out of fear for their safety and livelihoods. .As darkness drew in along the UAE coast, Captain Joginder Singh stood waiting. .His ship, the Gulf Sky, had been stuck at anchor while a legal battle took place between its current and former owners. When Capt Singh was brought in to take the helm, he says he was assured the ship would be sailing again soon. .But the weeks had turned to months. The all-Indian crew allege that food, fresh water and internet access were scarce, and with the pandemic in full swing, they were barred from travelling to the mainland. To make matters worse, the crew say that, from April, they stopped receiving their pay. .That evening, on 5 July, Capt Singh was hoping for a fresh start. The ship's owners had allegedly arranged for a group of surveyors to assess the tanker for a new role. When a small boat finally appeared from the dark, the weary officer says he ordered the gangway lowered and went to meet them. .All seemed normal at first, the captain says. A group of seven men in blue overalls, clipboards in hand, went with the crew to inspect the ship. After an hour their survey was done and the group's leader - a podgy, amiable man in his 60s, according to Capt Singh and others - asked the 28-man crew to gather in the mess. .The chief surveyor said the ship was going to be turned into an oil storage container, the captain and crew recall, and he asked who wanted to stay on board a few more months - for extra pay, of course. But when just two sailors said yes, the mood quickly soured. .By now it was almost midnight, so Capt Singh suggested everyone went to bed. But as he made for the door he says three men suddenly rushed into the room. Dressed in black and brandishing assault rifles, they screamed at everyone to get on the floor. .""We don't want to hurt you but we will if we have to,"" the chief surveyor said, according to the captain and several crew. ""America has stolen this ship and we are taking it back."" .""At first we thought they were pirates but they were very professional - they knew what they were doing,"" says one mariner. .The crew say that as they lay face down, their captors quickly bound everyone's hands and took everything from the sailors' pockets. Some crew began crying and begging for their lives, but they say their guards kicked them in the sides and told them to be quiet. .After about hour, the floor began to shake beneath them as the ship's engines were fired up and its anchor raised, the sailors recall. .Once the Gulf Sky began to move from its anchorage in Khor Fakkan, it didn't stop for another 12 hours, say the crew. When it finally did so, the men's hands were untied and they were moved into another room - the officer's mess - where the windows had been covered with cardboard. .Crew members say that, for days and days, they were kept under constant watch by guards who spoke Arabic to one another. When they were allowed out of the mess to use the nearby toilet or cook food in the ship's kitchen, several remember seeing new faces around the ship. .One person says he talked to a man he met in the kitchen who said he was from Azerbaijan. Others remember hearing voices around the ship speaking in Farsi. They believe a new crew had been brought in to run the ship in their place. .During their captivity, several mariners say they were briefly joined in the mess by another overweight man in his 60s, who didn't speak with the crew. ""It looked like he was facilitating things,"" one crew member said. ""He had a gun but he did not show any aggressiveness."" .Others remember another captor: a bald, muscled man, also in his 60s, whom the other armed guards appeared to take their lead from. He did not give his name, but said he worked for the ship's owners. .""We do not have anything against you guys,"" one crew member recalls him saying. ""We just want the ship. We had paid the money and the payment was stopped. It's not our fault."" .""The problem is no country wants to take you, even your own country,"" he added. ""You're completely at our mercy."" .As the days dragged on, fear among the crew was growing. .""Sometimes we felt that maybe they were going to kill us,"" says one mariner. ""We felt that we weren't going to see our families again."" .Though they were told to stay quiet, to pass the time the crew would sometimes speak with the guards. There was one conversation a sailor remembers vividly. .""He said 'I see how you are with the rest of the crew and I see you are a very nice fellow, but if you do something bad, then I'll have to do what I'm told,'"" he recalls. .""'Because I like you I can only give you the option of how you would like to die: I can cut your throat or give you a bullet in the head.'"" .Luckily, the crew member never had to make that choice. .In the early hours of 14 July, the guards took the men on deck. Some crew immediately recognised the constellations of artificial lights dotted along a nearby shore. They say it was Bandar Abbas, a port city in southern Iran. .The group say they were offloaded onto a wooden boat, then blindfolded. But before their eyes were covered, some noticed that the Gulf Sky's name on the sides of the tanker had been painted over in black. .They report being taken ashore and travelling to an airfield. When their blindfolds were finally taken off, the crew noticed that they were on a plane - a military jet, they say - which transported them to Tehran. .From here they were shepherded on to a bus and eventually found themselves at the side of a road alongside Imam Khomeini International Airport. .According to the crew, three men then got on the bus. They said they were from the Indian embassy and demanded to know who everyone was and why they were in Iran. .Capt Singh told them of the hijacking, and the men seemed shocked at the news, crew members say. The officials said tickets had been arranged for everyone to fly home, the captain and crew recall, and the group were handed their passports and boarding passes - except for two sailors whose passports needed renewing. .The pair left with the Indian diplomats, while the rest of the mariners were escorted on to a regular commercial flight. They shared rows of seats with ordinary passengers, apparently oblivious to the crew's ordeal, several crew members say. .The sailors landed in New Delhi on 15 July, with their two compatriots following suit on 22 July. Before returning home, Indian officials put them up in a hotel room and told them to stay inside for their own safety. .""They said 'You can't go outside because it's a very dangerous situation. The guys on the vessel may find you,'"" one seafarer told the BBC. .Today, more than a year after these dramatic events, the crew of the Gulf Sky are still searching for answers about how and why the alleged seizure of the vessel took place. .They are also battling for over $200,000 in back pay they say they're owed from the time the ship was held off the UAE. .""Seafarers are at the bottom of the chain,"" says David Hammond, chief executive of UK charity Human Rights at Sea, who first publicly reported the men's case. ""They should have fundamental human and labour rights protections under existing international law, but the effective enforcement of international law is a constant challenge,"" he adds. .The Commonwealth of Dominica, the ship's flag state at the time of the alleged hijacking, says it is working to recover the crew's pay. So does the company that hired the crew, Seven Seas Navigation. .Questions also remain about the fate of the Gulf Sky itself. It's unclear where the ship is now - or what it's being used for. But what little we do know, points to why it was seized. .Records show its transponder was switched off for weeks after the alleged hijacking. In late August 2020, when it was first turned on, the vessel was floating off the coast of southern Iran. .It has since been renamed Rima and swapped its flag of convenience from Dominica to Iran - meaning it now falls under Iranian jurisdiction. It has also changed hands and is now owned by a Tehran-based mining company, Moshtag Tejarat Sanat (MTS). .In the final days of August 2020, the vessel sailed west around the Persian Gulf, and its transponder last went off on 30 August, 60km (37 miles) south of Bandar Bushehr - one of Iran's major port cities. .Michelle Bockmann, from Lloyds List Intelligence, believes the ship is still operating within the region and is now part of Iran's ""ghost fleet"" - helping to transport Iranian oil around the world, in breach of sanctions. .""The fact that it hasn't had its [locator] turned on probably means it's become what we call a 'mother ship' - storing crude [oil] and perhaps transferring it to and from other tankers,"" Ms Bockmann told the BBC. ""If it comes out of Iranian waters it'll be marked,"" she adds. ""Everyone knows it's an Iranian ship."" .Even before the apparent hijacking, US authorities believe the ship already had ties to Iran. .Its owners at the time, Taif Mining Services (TMS), had bought the vessel in 2019 from a Greek company. But soon after the ship was delivered, nearly all funding from the sale was seized by the US. .The US justice department has since charged two Iranian nationals with using TMS as a front to buy the vessel on behalf of Iranian authorities, in violation of American sanctions against the country. .One of the nationals, Amir Dianat, is managing director of MTS - the ship's new owner since the alleged hijacking. .Neither TMS or MTS have responded to requests for comment. .In their conversations with the BBC, the Gulf Sky's former crew have described how they feel like victims of geopolitical forces beyond their control. And nagging questions linger for many of them. .How was their ship able to leave the UAE so easily, even though it was detained? Why did Iran give the ship safe harbour? If the ship's then-owners, TMS, had arranged for the surveyors to come onboard, were they involved in the alleged hijacking as well? .Seven Seas Navigation has questioned why it took the UAE so long to report the ship missing. Director Shaik Shakeel Ahmed says he lost contact with the crew on the night of the alleged hijacking, and he messaged harbour authorities to ask where they were. .In correspondence seen by the BBC, he was told that the Gulf Sky was still anchored the harbour - several days after the alleged hijacking. It would be another three days until UAE authorities registered the boat as missing. .Captain Abdulla Al-Hayyas, director of UAE's Maritime Transport Affairs department, insists that this isn't evidence of his country's involvement. Instead, he concedes that proper checks weren't carried out to find the ship after it vanished from harbour authorities' radar. .As to why the ship got away so easily, Capt Al-Hayyas says it's incredibly rare for a detained ship to try and escape. Any eloping vessel would simply be detained elsewhere, and those on board wouldn't be allowed to work anymore. .But while the sailors look for answers, some people aren't entirely convinced by their version of events. Others believe some seafarers may have been a part of the plot. .""We're happy that they've reached home and are safe, but there are a lot of questions,"" says Captain Abdulla Al-Hayyas. .One concern is how the ship was able to sail so quickly after the alleged hijacking. Usually, it would take a long time to prime a ship's engines and hoist up the anchor. .The ship's engine had also fallen into disrepair, says Mr Shakeel, and hadn't been officially inspected for months. He believes that any hijackers would have needed help from the crew - to prepare the engines beforehand, and to assess if Gulf Sky could make it safely to Iran. .Crew members who've spoken to the BBC have denied helping their captors. .""It's outrageous,"" said one sailor. ""Someone with their brain in the right place wouldn't accuse us of that. If we were involved and paid by the Iranians, why are we fighting for our salaries?"" .With the ship's whereabouts unknown, and its owners silent, the Gulf Sky's former crew say justice has become elusive. .For now, nearly all of those interviewed by the BBC are back at sea, working on ships around the world. But it's not been an easy decision. .""I'm worried, I don't feel safe anywhere, but how else can I feed my kids?"" says Capt Singh. ""It's the only job I know.""",198

They accused it of supporting terrorism, which it denied. .The neighbours agreed to restore full diplomatic ties at a summit on Tuesday. .A joint declaration brokered by Kuwait and the United States pledged to “restore collaboration” among the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), but it did not give any timelines. .At a virtual news conference on Thursday, Mr Gargash stressed that the UAE was ""behind this deal, and positive about the prospect of re-establishing relations with Qatar”. .""The return of movement [of people] and trade between the two countries... will be within a week of the signing,"" he said. .But he added: ""Some issues are easier to fix and some others will take a longer time. .""We have a very good start... but we have issues with rebuilding trust."" .The Saudi crown prince embraced Qatar's emir at the summit .Qatar’s Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, meanwhile told the Financial Times that it had agreed to suspend legal cases against its neighbours related to the embargo, and that it would co-operate on counter-terrorism and “transnational security”. .But he also said Qatar would not alter its close relations with Iran and Turkey, who Mr Gargash accused of interfering in Arab sovereignty and interests. .“Bilateral relationships are mainly driven by a sovereign decision of a country... [and] the national interest,” he said. “So there is no effect on our relationship with any other country”. .Qatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to some other Gulf states, but there were two issues which particularly angered its neighbours. .One was Qatar's support for Islamists. Qatar acknowledged providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the transnational Muslim Brotherhood. But it denied aiding jihadist groups like al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS). .The other key issue was Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. Iran, a Shia Muslim power, is Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. .Qatar's defence partnership with Turkey also concerned its neighbours. Like Qatar, Turkey supports Muslim Brotherhood-linked groups across the Middle East. It and the UAE also back opposing sides in the conflict in Libya. .In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed all diplomatic and trade ties. .Qatar's only land border was closed; ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports; and much of the region's airspace was closed to Qatari aircraft. .The countries presented Qatar with 13 demands as conditions for ending the embargo. They included closing Al Jazeera and other Qatar-funded news outlets; downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran; closing a Turkish military base in Qatar; and ending ""interference"" in other countries' internal affairs. .Qatar refused to comply, saying it would not agree to ""surrender"" its sovereignty and that the ""blockade"" violated international law. .The emirate quickly established new trade routes with Iran and Turkey to ensure the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million were met, and used its oil and gas wealth to prop up its economy. .Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman.

208,114,5 January 2021,Qatar crisis: Saudi Arabia and allies restore diplomatic ties with emirate," .The Saudi crown prince embraced Qatar's emir at the summit .Diplomatic relations have been restored between Qatar and four Arab states that imposed an embargo against it for three years, the Saudi foreign minister says. .Prince Faisal bin Farhad told reporters that the countries had agreed to ""fully set our differences aside"" at a Gulf Co-operation Council summit on Tuesday. .Earlier, Saudi Arabia's crown prince publicly embraced the emir of Qatar. .Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. .The tiny, gas- and oil-rich state denied the accusation and rejected the conditions for ending the partial blockade, including closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera broadcast network and curbing relations with Iran. .In recent months, Kuwaiti and US mediators stepped up efforts to end the stand-off. .At Tuesday's summit in the Saudi heritage site of al-Ula, leaders of the six GCC member states signed an agreement that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said affirmed ""our Gulf, Arab and Islamic solidarity and stability"". .""There is a desperate need today to unite our efforts to promote our region and to confront challenges that surround us, especially the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile programme and its plans for sabotage and destruction,"" he added. .Later, Prince Faisal told a news conference: ""What happened today is... the turning of the page on all points of difference and a full return of diplomatic relations."" .On Monday night, Saudi Arabia agreed to reopen its land and sea borders and airspace to Qatar. .The lifting of the embargo on Qatar has taken months of patient, painstaking diplomacy, mostly by Kuwait, but with increasingly urgent prodding from the White House as the Trump presidency draws to a close. .The three-and-a-half year ""blockade"" has been immensely costly to both Qatar's economy and to the notion of Gulf unity. Qataris will not forgive or forget in a hurry what they see as a stab in the back by their Gulf Arab neighbours. .But beyond the diplomatic rhetoric one country in particular - the UAE - has grave doubts that Qatar is actually going to change its ways. While Qatar denies supporting terrorism it has supported political Islamist movements in Gaza, Libya and elsewhere, notably the transnational Muslim Brotherhood which the UAE views as an existential threat to its monarchy. .Meanwhile, the embargo has, if anything, pushed Qatar closer to Saudi Arabia's ideological enemies: Turkey and Iran. .Qatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to some other Gulf states, but there are two key issues which have angered its neighbours in the past decade. .One is Qatar's support for Islamists. Qatar acknowledges providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood.

Kuwait served as a mediator in the dispute. .US President Donald Trump unexpectedly sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies at the start of the dispute, denouncing Qatar as a ""funder of terror"" despite the emirate hosting the largest American military facility in the Middle East, al-Udeid airbase. .But Mr Trump's aides subsequently persuaded him to take a more neutral stance, and in 2018 he praised Sheikh Tamim's work on combating terrorist financing at a White House meeting. .Kuwaiti mediation efforts appeared to make little progress until late last year, when the Trump administration intensified pressure on all sides for an end to the stand-off that thwarted their efforts to assemble an alliance of Sunni-led states to counter Iran and its proxies. .Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar in December, and reportedly flew to al-Ula on Monday to attend the summit. .How is Qatar coping with its embargo?",208

210,116,9 December 2020,Saudi Arabia: Three campaigns MBS cannot win," .These are uncomfortable days for Saudi Arabia's leadership and in particular for its all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS. .At home he remains popular, but internationally he has been unable to shake off the veil of suspicion for his alleged role in the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. .And now a new US administration is preparing to move into the White House and President-elect Joe Biden has made it clear he will be taking a much tougher stance than his predecessor on certain Saudi positions. .So what are the issues at stake and why do they matter to those in power in Washington and Riyadh? .This has been a disaster for almost everyone involved, but most of all for Yemen's own impoverished, malnourished population. .Saudi Arabia didn't start this conflict - the Houthis did when they marched on the capital Sanaa in late 2014 and overthrew the legitimate government. The Houthis are a tribal grouping from the mountainous north, and represent less than 15% of the country's population. .Yemen crisis: Five years of hunger, five years of war .In March 2015, MBS, as the Saudi defence minister, secretly assembled a coalition of Arab states then entered the war with massive air power, expecting to force the Houthis to surrender within months. .Almost six years on, with thousands killed and displaced, and war crimes committed by both sides, the Saudi-led coalition has failed to dislodge the Houthis from Sanaa and much of the populous west of Yemen. .With help from Iran, the Houthis have been sending increasingly accurate missiles and explosive drones into Saudi Arabia, hitting oil facilities as far away as Jeddah. .It's a costly stalemate and numerous peace plans have collapsed, one after another. .The Yemen war is killing Yemenis and bleeding Saudi coffers, while attracting mounting criticism abroad. .The Saudis would like to find a face-saving way out of it. But having set out, in their words, ""to stop Iran gaining a foothold on their southern border"", they insist they cannot accept an armed militia backed by Iran holding power in Yemen. .However, time is running out for the Saudi war effort. .By 2016, at the end of his presidency, Barack Obama was already holding back on some US support. Donald Trump reversed that policy and gave Riyadh all the intelligence and material assistance it asked for. Now Mr Biden's administration has indicated that is unlikely to continue. .The pressure is on to end this war, one way or another. .This has been an international PR catastrophe for the Saudi leadership. .Thirteen peaceful Saudi women activists have been locked up, and in some cases horrifically abused, for the apparent crime of demanding the right to drive and an end to the grossly unfair system of male guardianship. .(June 2018) Saudi women hit the road .Many, including the most high-profile prisoner Loujain al-Hathloul, were arrested in 2018, just before the ban on women driving was lifted. .Saudi officials maintain Ms Hathloul is guilty of espionage and ""taking money from foreign powers"", but they have failed to produce any evidence. .Her friends say she did nothing more than attend a human rights conference overseas and apply for a job at the UN. .Her family report that she has been beaten, electrocuted and threatened with rape while in detention, and that the last time they saw her she was shaking uncontrollably. .Just as with the Yemen war, this is a hole the Saudi leadership has dug itself into and is now searching for a face-saving way out of. .Having detained the women for so long, without any evidence that would stand up in court in a country with an independent judiciary, the most obvious exit route is for a ""magnanimous pardon"". .Expect this issue to be raised by the incoming Biden administration. .This, on the surface, is poised to be resolved after exhaustive, behind-the-scenes Kuwaiti mediation. Beneath the surface, however, the problem runs deeper. .In 2017, within days of President Trump's visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia joined up with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to impose a crippling boycott on their Gulf neighbour Qatar. .The reason, they said, was because of Qatar's unacceptable backing for Islamist groups, amounting to terrorism. .The UAE produced a dossier of alleged terrorists who were living in Qatar, but the country denied supporting terrorism and refused to accede to the quartet's demands, which included reining in its flagship TV broadcaster, Al Jazeera. .As with the Houthis in Yemen, there was a misplaced expectation that the Qataris would crumble and eventually capitulate. They haven't, thanks in part to their enormous wealth - Qatar sits on a massive offshore gas field and has invested more than £40bn ($53bn) in the UK economy alone - and also support from Turkey and Iran. .What this has meant in practice is that in recent years a profound fissure has emerged in the Middle East. .On one side are those three conservative, Sunni Gulf Arab monarchies - Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain - together with their ally, Egypt. .On the other side is Qatar, Turkey and the various political Islamist movements they both support, such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas in Gaza. .These transnational movements are anathema to the quartet's leaders, who see them as an existential threat to their rule. .There is no question that the three-and-a-half-year-long boycott of Qatar has been both economically and politically damaging to both sides. .It has also made a mockery of Gulf Arab unity at a time when Gulf Arab leaders increasingly worry about Iran's nuclear and missile programmes. .President Trump's envoy Jared Kushner has been in the Gulf pushing for an end to the dispute, and certainly a Biden administration will want to see it resolved. Qatar is, after all, host to the Pentagon's largest overseas base at Al-Udaid. .But whatever is agreed in mediation will still need to be borne out in practice. .It will take years for Qatar to forgive its neighbours and it will take years for them to trust Qatar again. .Saudi woman activist 'faces terrorism tribunal' .Saudi Arabia's human rights problems that won't go away .The deep diplomatic tensions behind the Qatar row .Just how deep are Saudi Arabia's troubles? .Yemen: Why is there a war there? .Reform and repression go hand in hand in Saudi Arabia .How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power",210

""I'm keeping an eye on the results coming in from Wisconsin."" .That was eight days ago, when we still did not know who would be in the White House in January. .When Joe Biden was declared the winner, the Saudi leadership in Riyadh took rather longer to respond than they did when Donald Trump was elected. .This is hardly surprising: they had just lost a friend at the top table. .Mr Biden's victory could now have far-reaching consequences for Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf Arab states. .The US strategic partnership with the region goes back to 1945 and it will likely endure, but changes are coming and they will not all be welcome in Gulf capitals. .President Trump was a massive ally and supporter of Saudi Arabia's ruling Saud family. .He chose Riyadh as the destination for his first foreign presidential visit after taking office in 2017. .His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, formed a close working relationship with the all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. .When every major Western intelligence agency suspected the crown prince of being behind the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, President Trump refused to blame him outright. .Little wonder that MBS's team told people in the days immediately afterwards: ""Don't worry, we've got this."" .Mr Trump also resisted strident calls in Congress to curb arms sales to the Saudis. .So Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, are about to lose a major ally in the White House. .Plenty of things will not change but here is a look at some of the things that are likely to. .President Barack Obama, under whom Mr Biden served as vice-president for eight years, was increasingly uncomfortable about Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war against Yemen's Houthi rebels. .By the time he left office, the air war had been going for almost two years with little military success while inflicting enormous damage on civilians and the country's infrastructure. .Alert to the war's unpopularity on Capitol Hill, President Obama cut back on US military and intelligence aid to the Saudi war machine. .The Trump administration reversed that move and effectively gave the Saudis a free hand in Yemen. .Now it looks set to flip back again, with Mr Biden recently telling the Council on Foreign Relations that he would ""end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen and order a reassessment of our relationship with Saudi Arabia"". .Pressure from an incoming Biden administration on the Saudis and their Yemeni allies to settle this conflict is now likely to increase. .The Saudis, and the Emiratis, realised some time ago this was never going to end in a military victory and have themselves been looking for a face-saving exit that does not leave the Houthis in exactly the same place they were when the air war started in March 2015. .President Obama's one big legacy in the Middle East was the hard-won Iran nuclear deal - the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). .This lifted sanctions on Iran in return for strict compliance with limits on its nuclear activities and inspections of its nuclear facilities. .President Trump called it ""the worst deal ever"" and pulled the US out of it. .Now, his successor looks set to take the US back into the agreement in some form. .This appals the Saudis. In Riyadh last autumn, shortly after the mysterious missile attacks on Saudi Arabia's petrochemical plants, I attended a press conference by the kingdom's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, who lambasted the Iran nuclear deal. .It was disastrous, he said, as it did not take into account (it was never meant to) Iran's expansive strategic missile programme nor the proliferation of its proxy militias across the Middle East. .The whole deal, he implied, was part of the flawed legacy of an Obama administration that had not appreciated the extent of the danger posed by the Islamic Republic. .The Saudis and some of their Gulf allies quietly applauded when in January this year the US carried out a drone strike in Iraq that assassinated Gen Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm, the Quds Force. .Now they worry whether the incoming White House team will be tempted to make a bargain with Tehran that undercuts their own interests. .Qatar is home to the Pentagon's largest and most strategically important base in the Middle East: Al-Udeid Air Base. .From there, the US directs all its air operations in the Central Command region, from Syria to Afghanistan. .And yet Qatar is still under a damaging boycott from a quartet of Arab states - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt - who are all furious at its support for political Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood. .The boycott began shortly after President Trump's much-trumpeted visit to Riyadh in 2017, and the quartet clearly thought they had his backing. .In fact, Mr Trump initially and briefly supported it publicly until it was explained to him that Qatar was also a US ally and that Al-Udaid was rather important to the US defence department. .President-elect Biden's administration is likely to push for this inter-Gulf rift to be healed. It has not been in the interest of the US, and it certainly has not been in the interests of the Gulf Arab states themselves. .Several of the Gulf states have poor human rights records. .But President Trump never showed much interest in castigating his Arab allies on the issue. .He argued that US strategic interests and business deals overrode any concerns about imprisoned women's rights campaigners; the alleged abuse of foreign labourers in Qatar; or the fact that in October 2018 Saudi government security men flew in official planes to Istanbul to carry out a pre-planned operation to silence Saudi Arabia's most vocal critic, Jamal Khashoggi, disposing of his body which has never been found to this day. .President-elect Biden and his administration are unlikely to be so forgiving.",213

The assault on young men and women trying to build a future for themselves and their country has shaken the city's residents and caused outrage. It's hard to comprehend who could commit such cold-hearted murders. .The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility, releasing a photograph of two masked attackers, who, it said, targeted a ceremony for ""the graduation of judges and investigators"". .Gunshots heard as students try to escape the Kabul University .IS is the latest player to emerge in the murky world of militants in the country, further complicating the already bloody war between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents. It's far less powerful than the Taliban and recently lost most of the territory it once controlled in the east of the country, but it retains the ability to carry out deadly attacks. .Both the Taliban and the government have fought against IS and both regard it with suspicion, accusing each other of secretly supporting the jihadists and using them to undermine slow-moving peace talks. .That war of narratives over IS has come to the fore in the aftermath of this awful attack. .Amrullah Saleh, the first vice-president of Afghanistan, and a vocal critic of the Taliban, described the IS statement as ""fake"", stating that the weapons found at the scene do not match those in the photo released by IS. Mr Saleh also pointed to a ""Taliban flag"" apparently found at the scene of the attack as evidence that the Taliban - rather than IS - carried it out. .Journalists visiting the site took photographs of the specifically pro-Taliban slogan ""Long live the Emirate"" scrawled on the bullet-ridden wall of a classroom. .There was a further mysterious development, when a video was uploaded to the internet, purportedly of masked IS militants denying they were involved in the attack, and blaming the Taliban. .Most experts, however, agree the video is a fake. And it remains unclear why, if the Taliban wanted to avoid association with the attack, they would bring a flag with them to the scene. .Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid issued an angry rebuttal, asking: ""How is it possible for assailants to find the time to draw graffiti on walls while being engaged in combat? And what purpose would taking a flag to attack site serve?"" .A Taliban statement condemned the attack, and accused the government of supporting IS, suggesting it had encouraged the group to stage the assault for ""propaganda"" purposes. The Taliban's criticism of the violence rings rather hollow, however, as they are widely believed to have carried out an assault on another university in the city in 2016, in which 13 people were killed. .Borhan Osman, a senior analyst who has conducted extensive research into the Afghan conflict, told the BBC that both sides have ""strongly held"" narratives about IS but there has been no real evidence substantiating the claims advanced by either the Taliban or the government. .The counter-accusations mirror similar claims by both sides about IS in the past too. .Supporters of the government have often accused the Taliban of carrying out attacks on ""soft targets"" but deliberately not claiming them, and allowing IS to take responsibility instead, in order to benefit from the chaos of the violence whilst avoiding the public backlash. .Is peace with the Taliban possible? .There is something of a precedent for this: suicide attacks with large numbers of civilian casualties, widely thought to have been carried out by the Taliban, and its affiliated Haqqani network, have at times gone unclaimed. .However, the Taliban have fought fiercely against IS in eastern Afghanistan, determined not to allow them to usurp their position in the insurgency. The Taliban have claimed the Afghan government helped rescue IS fighters during clashes between the two militant groups in the north. Afghan officials deny that. .There's no doubt that the conflict with the Taliban saps some of the energy that the government could be expending on tackling IS, and for a war-weary public, divisions between the militants seem irrelevant in the face of widespread violence. .Security officials in Kabul also have said they believe, despite the Taliban's rivalry with IS, that the two groups tap into the same logistical support networks when carrying out attacks in the city. .But there are also apparently significant ideological differences between the groups. .The Taliban profess to only wanting to implement an ""Islamic government"" or ""Islamic Emirate within Afghanistan"", and insist they do not pose a threat to other countries, whereas the Afghan branch of IS flaunts its links with affiliates in the Middle East and the idea of a global ""caliphate"". .IS has also been much more openly sectarian, repeatedly targeting Kabul's Shia minority in bloody suicide bombings on weddings, shrines and sports clubs in a way the Taliban have not. Last month IS killed more than 20 students outside a tuition centre in a Kabul neighbourhood largely populated by ethnic Hazaras, followers of Shia Islam whom IS regard as heretics. .In an interview two years ago, one IS prisoner held in a Kabul prison told the BBC the group considered itself the only ""real Muslims"", following, in their view, a true, undiluted interpretation of the religion, which they contrasted to the Taliban's more nationalist-infused views. He dismissed the Taliban as ""agents"" of the Pakistani intelligence services. .Research by Borhan Osman for the United States Peace Institute also indicates that around Kabul at least, IS has managed to recruit from sectors of the population not typically drawn to the Taliban, such as ""men and women from middle-class families, many of whom are non-Pashtun university students"". .One of the attackers at Kabul University was referred to by IS using the nom de guerre ""Anas al Banishiri"", suggesting a link to Panjshir province, traditionally a stronghold of anti-Taliban sentiment. By contrast, Mr Osman wrote, the Taliban generally receive support from more rural and ethnically Pashtun communities. .The horrific violence carried out by IS has the potential to disrupt the already stalling peace talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban, with the bloodshed further raising tensions and increasing disillusionment amongst the public. .And whilst predictions that IS could attract defections from hard line elements in the Taliban opposed to the peace process have so far failed to materialise, the attacks also highlight the continued danger the group could pose, even if an agreement between the two main warring parties is eventually reached. .Mr Osman told the BBC the competing narratives over IS mean ""there is a risk of overlooking the actual threat, however small, that comes from urban youth who are well-educated and have become radicalised"". At the moment, he said, ""there is very little appetite in acknowledging or doing anything about this threat"". .You may also be interested in: .Ogai Wardak, 18: ""If the Taliban come, I will fight them"" .At least 22 dead as gunmen storm Kabul University",214

219,125,25 September 2020,Bailed Greek prison Scot Conor Howard regrets buying joke gift," .A Scottish engineer who faces a year in a Qatari jail over a drugs charge has been released on bail in Greece. .Conor Howard says he regrets buying a joke gift for a friend after it led him to be arrested in Qatar and then jailed in Greece nearly a year later. .His problems began when a herb grinder was found in his luggage during an expected stopover in Qatar in October. .He was unaware he was later convicted in his absence, and an international arrest warrant issued. .The 27-year-old discovered he was a wanted man when he was detained at the airport in Corfu in August on his way to visit his parents at their holiday home. .After spending nearly a month in a Greek jail, Mr Howard, from Tranent in East Lothian, was released on bail on Friday and reunited with his parents. .But he still faces extradition to Qatar and cannot travel back to Scotland. .Speaking to the BBC from Corfu, he said his purchase of a joke gift before returning home from Australia had spiralled out of all proportion. .A flight delay meant his flight landed late in the Middle Eastern country and he had missed his connecting flight. .He said: ""I was never planning on being in Qatar. I understand it has strict laws. I never thought a piece of metal would be part of that. .""Obviously I regret doing it now I know the circumstances. I do regret it, yes. If I knew what was going to happen I would never have done it."" .He described the events that unfolded in Qatar as life changing. .""It was going to be a one-hour thing. Then there was a delay and I had to actually enter the country. I had forgotten about it until I went through security and they pulled it out of the bag. I didn't think I would be in serious trouble."" .He was detained and taken to a police station where he thought he would sign a piece of paper and hand the herb grinder over. But when he got to the police station he said he was again questioned. .He said: ""I felt like they were trying to interrogate me a bit and say that I was going to take drugs in their country. Obviously I wasn't. .""They started to take my picture and the guy said you'll need to go to court and that's when it really hit me the severity of the situation. It was frightening"" .After being taken to court there, he was drugs tested and had to wait 12 hours until he was allowed to continue his journey home. .After the experience, he vowed he would never let himself get into a situation like that again. .But 10 months later, he boarded a flight to meet his mother and step-father in Corfu, and another phase of his ordeal began. .He said: ""First they said my passport hadn't scanned properly so they asked me to wait at the side. I had to wait for half an hour to speak to someone and then they said there was an international warrant out for my arrest. .""My heart just sunk. I though all this was over."" .He was kept in a Greek prison for more than three weeks before his hearing on Thursday. .He was made to quarantine for two weeks and then shared a cell with a number of other men. .He said it was a high pressure atmosphere and he could not relax the entire time. .He must now stay in Greece until 4 November when he is due back in court. .He said: ""I am feeling positive after getting bail and getting released from prison. .""I am so grateful to all the people who have helped and I just want to relax and see my family and girlfriend and not be stuck between four walls."" .Radha Stirling, of campaign group Detained in Dubai, represents the family and believes Mr Howard should never have been jailed in the first place. .She said: ""At the whim of a country notorious for Interpol and extradition abuse, a European country has been used as a conduit to unfairly detain a British national. .""Qatar has been responsible for a number of arrests and detentions inside the EU over the past 24 months.

221,127,24 September 2020,Qatar investment pulled by Sussex PCC over human rights abuse fears," .Concerns about human rights abuse have prompted the Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner to withdraw £6m invested in Qatar. .Katy Bourne made the decision after members of an independent audit committee criticised the investment. .Committee member Mike Heap said: ""Lending money to Qatar does seem to jar with everything we say about equality, diversity and how we like to go about our business."" .In 2019, £20m was invested in Qatar. .The £6m pulled now represents more than half of the PCC's £11.4m investments as of March 31, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported. .The year before, the total investment figure was £46.5m, with just under half going to Qatar. .The decision comes after a report from human rights group Amnesty International said thousands of people were exploited by unscrupulous employers and were not being paid for their work in 2019. .As well as Qatar's record with labour laws, its attitude to LGBQT+ people was also questioned by the committee. .Mr Heap said: ""Lending money to a country that still outlaws homosexuality is something we should probably look to trade out of."" .Mrs Bourne said she shared those concerns and added: ""Human rights observers say, whilst progress is being made, there is still a long way to go. .""I will be withdrawing our investment in Qatar and I have asked for a review across our investment portfolio."" .Afghan-Taliban peace talks: What's next? .First Space Force deployment not so far, far away .Qatar still failing workers - Amnesty",221
222,128,23 September 2020,Afghan-Taliban peace talks: What's next?," .History took a front seat at the table this month when Afghan enemies formally sat face to face for the first time to embark on negotiations to end what is now regarded as the world's deadliest conflict. .""We'll start introductions on the left,"" suggested Masoom Stanikzai, the grey-bearded chief negotiator of the Afghan government's chosen delegation who only just survived a suicide attack nine years ago by bombers posing as messengers of peace. .From the other long table, on the other side of the glittering Qatari ballroom, another Stanikzai of no relation loudly interjected with a grin. ""You always do things from the left,"" chimed in the white-bearded deputy head of the Taliban team, Abbas Stanikzai. ""We mujahideen start from the right always."" .In an instant, in these very first moments, would-be peacemakers were pulled back to days gone by when they brandished banners for communism or Islam - a violent war of words which sparked the Soviet invasion of 1979 and a fire which kills and maims across Afghanistan to this day. .History has left its calling card in these talks which are as emotional as they are historic. Forty-two negotiators, one for every painful year of war, are now charged with the Herculean task of turning this page. .Formal interviews and informal conversations over the first 10 days of talks in the Qatari capital, Doha, signalled both early signs of hopeful progress as well as significant and stubborn disagreements over visions of a post-war future which imperil this push towards peace. .All the while, reports keep reaching negotiators from the Afghan battlefield thousands of miles away. .But they're as close as ever-present phones with encrypted messaging services and social media posts seething with an anger and anguish, on both sides, and intensifying the pressure. .The BBC's Lyse Doucet interviews US peace envoy in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad .The UN reports that civilian casualties are now at a lower level than in recent years. But on one day alone, four separate incidents killed 20 women, boys and girls and injured 39. .The first task on the table has been formulating a ""code of conduct"", the rules and regulations to shepherd these talks. .Some of an initial 23 points were swiftly settled - such as starting each session with a recitation of the holy Koran, ending with prayers, and treating each other with respect. .But the Taliban immediately put bigger issues on the table - unsettling for the other side - including insistence that disputes be resolved within the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, one of four major schools of Sunni legal reasoning, without provisions for the Shia community as codified in the Afghan constitution. .They also called for this set of talks to be subsumed within the US-Taliban deal signed in February. .But, after a few days of stalemate and silence, progress was reported when ""contact groups"" from the two sides sat down again. .And they wrestled with the significant semantics of what this is all about. The government team spoke of ending the ""war"". The Taliban wanted to see it as ""problems"". They inched towards a compromise with ""conflict"". .Negotiators from Kabul, the capital, noticed that Taliban who sat at the table during the US-Taliban process - tough talks which took place over more than a year - learned skills which are helping break logjams now. .""The fact that we continue discussing these issues for hours is a step forward,"" said Nader Nadery, spokesman for the government delegation. ""We are focused on the task at hand: to end this war."" .""It's hoped that consensus will be reached on the remaining points,"" his Taliban counterpart, Dr Mohammad Naim, posted on his Twitter account, in English, Persian, and Pashto. .""Patience"" is the byword, always uttered with a knowing smile, by both Stanikzais whenever I ran into them, as they hurried to and fro in the sprawling beachside resort of white crenellated Arabian villas transformed, in part, into a negotiating hub. .Is peace with the Taliban possible? .But for all the small encouraging steps forward, the process is still firmly rooted in deep mistrust, and mutual recrimination. .While the government side prides itself on a team reflecting the diversity and strength of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Taliban hail their largely homogenous group as the stronger side at the table, and on the battlefield - a pole position they see embodied in their deal signed with the US which committed Washington to a phased withdrawal of its forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees and a commitment to negotiate a roadmap for peace. .Taliban officials accuse President Ashraf Ghani's supporters of trying to drag out this process on in the hope of changing the goal posts with the next US administration. .On the other side, Afghans worry the Taliban haven't moved significantly on fundamental issues since their harsh rule of the 1990s, and are just biding their time until US forces pull out to try to steal a march on Kabul. .""We are testing the waters now, and the waters are deep,"" reflected Habiba Sarabi, one of four women negotiators on the government side, who is part of the minority Shia Hazara community. .In public statements and private remarks, the Taliban speak of an Islamic system which is ""more Islamic"" than the current Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. .""It's too early to talk about this,"" a Taliban official replied when I asked about elections, but he hastened to dismiss all previous Afghan polls as riddled with fraud. .When I asked about democracy, he burst out laughing. .Women's rights is another hot button issue. The Taliban have been repeatedly asked about this and have repeatedly insisted that women and girls will be given all rights provided ""within Islam"". .They're also being repeatedly asked to include women on their own team. .""There's a war going on, so we need to respect and protect women,"" a Talib explained when I asked about female Taliban negotiators. ""When there is peace, they will have all their rights within Islam including education and work."" .Once rules and regulations governing the talks are agreed, the focus will shift to issues. .A ceasefire is at the top of the government's list, as it is for an exhausted people pleading for an end to the everyday violence. .For the Taliban, that can only come once progress is made on the shape of a new order. There will be another semantic search for a ""pause"", a ""reduction"", and the like. .For the moment, both sides insist they're committed to this process, and determined to stay the course. .""It's not easy to sit with your enemy, especially when we are still fighting on the ground,"" remarked Matin Bek. His father, a mujahideen commander and member of parliament, was assassinated by a suicide bomber in 2011. .""In the peace process, you meet your enemy, then you meet your friend."" .In the relaxed atmosphere of a hotel lobby where sides are more spontaneously blurred, 33-year-old Bek was spotted sitting cross-legged on the floor while negotiators from both sides perched on adjoining sofas. .Many have been in this place before, or their fathers were, when the Soviet troop withdrawal of 1989 led to vicious infighting among mujahideen groups which paved the way to Taliban rule. .""We all say we want peace, but it will take time,"" commented 26-year-old Anas Haqqani, the youngest member of the Taliban negotiating team and youngest son of the late Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose so-called ""Haqqani network"" was put on the US's terrorism list in 2012 - although they deny it now exists. .His older brother, Sirajuddin, is now the Taliban's deputy leader. .From the get-go, there was consensus on a crucial point. This was, to use the mantra, to be an ""Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process"". .From the seats at the top table, to the secretariat working at all hours to keep all the paper moving, to the arrangement of media interviews and interactions, Afghans are sorting it. .On the sidelines, at times in a cosy lobby of cushy leather chairs discreetly sheltered by miniature palms and marble pillars, diplomats from key countries engaged in this process and committed Afghan watchers are at the ready, if and when they're needed. .Ideas which worked in mediation efforts in other conflicts have already been seeded, successfully, into this one. .The six-member contact group from each side grapples for long hours with the gaps. There's a joint messaging system rarely adopted elsewhere. .""I've just sent a 'so far, so good' message back to the capital,"" commented one Western diplomat. .No-one can say for certain how long this round will last, how far it will go. .There's even a tussle over the venue of the next round. Some argue the process will benefit from just keeping it going in Qatar where extensive arrangements are already in place. .But Doha is also the site of a Taliban political office, and where many of their negotiators can go home at night to their families. .Four other countries in a contact group - Germany, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Norway - are also lined up as possible venues, and countries keen to get in on this act keep offering their services. .For now, the focus is squarely on what's on the table in Doha. But everyone is mindful too of events beyond this bubble, and the risk that a spectacular attack on the ground, or even an unpredictable tweet from the White House, could cause it to unravel. .When I ask about what worries the most, there's often one refrain: we must avoid the mistakes of the past, so history is not repeated. .US peace envoy on release of 'dangerous' Taliban.

He's not Pablo Escobar, it's a wee guy from Tranent here."" .Mum Adele added: ""What he has done is nothing. It is not a crime in Greece. It is not a crime in Britain but Greece are just trying to uphold what Qatar are saying."" .Radha Stirling, of campaign group Detained in Dubai, which is representing Conor said the arrest, detention and demand that he be taken back to Qatar was ridiculous, especially given that he was released in the first place. .She told the BBC: ""It is absolutely a strange case that he was arrested in the first place over carrying what is essentially a herb grinder. It could be used for tea or anything - it's completely legal in Australia where it was purchased, in the UK and in Greece. .""He was let go in Qatar after an investigation and then he suddenly finds himself arrested and detained in a Greek prison awaiting extradition for a one year sentence that was issued against him in his absentia."" .She added: ""It is really difficult to protect yourself against arbitrary enforcement and this is middle-east wide. We have seen people arrested for having poppy seeds on the bottom of their shoe that they picked up from a bread roll."" .His local MP in East Lothian, the SNP's Kenny MacAskill, has taken his case with the Foreign Office. .Mr MacAskill said he appreciated the sensitivities in dealing with the Qatari government but he is seeking a meeting with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary. .He said: ""The Greeks do require to accept the warrant that is issued. It is Qatar that's issued this warrant and it is Qatar that has to solve this problem. .""I cannot for the life of me understand why they would wish to have Conor back in their custody. He has not committed any criminal offence, and even if it they view this as something they don't approve of, it is so trivial it cannot merit sending Qatari police officers in a plane to Corfu to bring him back to Qatar. .""I do think the Foreign Office has to push harder and further for a British citizen who is detained in custody in Greece for no reason whatsoever other than some administrative error."" .Conor's friends have set up a campaign group called Get Milky Hame which has 1,700 members and have also set up fundraising pages to help with his family's expenses. .A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are supporting Mr Howard and his family following his arrest in Corfu and are in contact with the Greek authorities. .""Our staff have spoken to Conor on the phone to help him access legal advice and are also keeping Mr MacAskill up to date on the case.""",223

The league's owners and directors' test looks into the background of prospective club owners. .The UK government has been urged to block the takeover - which is 80% financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - until it investigates alleged TV piracy in the country. .The rights to show Premier League games in the Middle East belong to beIN Sports, which is in the middle of a three-year deal worth £400m. .In June, the World Trade Organization ruled that Saudi Arabia helped breach international piracy laws in relation to the broadcaster beoutQ, which has been accused of illegally showing a range of professional sport, including the Premier League. .Saudi Arabia has always denied aiding the beoutQ operation and has insisted there is no link between its government and the alleged piracy. .Dan Roan, BBC sports editor .This is an intriguing twist in this saga, given the sensitivities surrounding the Premier League's protracted consideration of Saudi Arabia's highly controversial takeover bid for Newcastle United. .By permanently preventing Qatar's beIN from broadcasting in the country, Saudi Arabia's authorities have ensured there is currently no legal way to watch Premier League football there. Would they really do that if they were expecting the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF) to imminently buy a top-flight club? .Well-placed sources suggest that this is a natural conclusion to a four-year legal dispute that pre-dates the current diplomatic dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and should not be interpreted as a sign that the Premier League is poised to reject the Newcastle United deal. Indeed, I am told it is an entirely separate matter from the PIF's hopes that their bid for the club is approved. .It is also suggested the move may be because Saudi Arabia is planning to set up its own sports network to buy TV rights direct from the Premier League. .But for many, it seems a strange move at a time when Saudi Arabia had seemed intent on pleasing the Premier League by promising to crack down on TV piracy, since being criticised in a landmark World Trade Organisation report last month.",231

Are the stadiums finished? Will fans be allowed to buy a beer? These are just some of the questions being asked. .BBC Sport has spoken to a range of fans, pundits and former players who travelled to Doha this month to get a taste of what to expect when the world's focus turns to the Middle East in 2022. .The longest distance between the eight grounds to be used at Qatar 2022 is just 34 miles (55km), while the shortest is three miles. .Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock, BBC Match of the Day's co-commentator in Doha, believes the chance for match-going fans to gorge themselves on World Cup fixtures will appeal to visitors. .""If you are a football fanatic then to get the opportunity to get to three games in one day and make the most of a World Cup in that way is going to make for a great experience, like no other tournament in fact,"" he said. .Ex-England winger John Barnes agrees. .""I don't think there'll be another World Cup where all the countries' fans are going to be within about a 30-mile radius to be able to interact with each other,"" Barnes added. .The World Cup in 2022 will start on 21 November, with the final on 18 December - the national day of Qatar. .Temperatures in Qatar at that time of year average between 18-24C and will be much cooler than if the World Cup had been held in the months of June and July, when temperatures can reach 40C. .Liverpool fan Andy Heaton, of the Liverpool podcast The Anfield Wrap, said temperatures were perfect for supporters. .""It's a little bit strange thinking it's almost Christmas time while the sun is blazing and we're all having a good time,"" he said. .""It's been moderate, a little bit windy but it's absolutely gorgeous."" .Warnock thinks the players will find the conditions ideal for tournament football. .""Conditions have been good. The temperature drops in the evening, so at the time Liverpool played both their matches last week it was about 20C, which is not too bad,"" he added. .""During the day, which is when some of the World Cup matches will be played in 2022, it has not been overly hot either. It even rained the first few days we were here. .""The tournament has been played in hotter temperatures than that in the past."" .The Club World Cup final took place at Doha's Khalifa International Stadium, which is one of the venues for the World Cup. .The other seven are at various stages of construction, with work expected to be completed by 2020. .Former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman has no concerns the requisite number of grounds for the tournament will be constructed in time. .He said: ""The stadiums look more than ready, compared with the problems in the past - ie South Africa and Brazil - when they were not as ready as they should have been. .Heaton was impressed with the acoustics of the ground where Liverpool's match took place. .""The stadium's a work of art. As a facility, it's flawless. I was impressed that the atmosphere stays in - it's like a bowl,"" he said. .However, one Liverpool supporter believes the organisers still have work to do for fans with mobility issues. .""One of my main issues at the ground was around mobility,"" said the Reds fan. ""My friend walks with a stick and they were very helpful. They've got buggies but it wasn't organised. They were saying 'oh you can't go there, oh you can't go there', then we needed a lift and they said there was one but when we got there they said it was VIPs only. .""They need to get that right. There are a lot of people with mobility issues who follow football all around the world. That's a big thing they need to address."" .Qatar will spend more than £160bn on infrastructure for the tournament in addition to the vast outlay on stadiums. .McManaman, though, has some concerns about congestion on the roads during the World Cup based on his time in the country. .""I think the down sides are the traffic will be really bad. Seeing it here, with the amount of people who are going to come, it will be a problem,"" said the former Liverpool and England winger. .""If you look around, or you leave the hotel, there are not many people walking on the streets. Nobody seems to walk around, everyone seems to drive."" .However, Warnock had a different experience. .""The organisation - in terms of getting to the ground and everything immediately before and after the games - was seamless,"" Warnock said. .""As a dress rehearsal for the World Cup, it has been a really good one."" .Heaton believes there are certainly a number of logistical concerns for the organisers to overcome for fans. .""Security's a bit intense at times, which is understandable given where we are and the situation at the minute with the other Gulf states,"" he explained. .""It was tough getting into the stadium. I wouldn't say it was heavy-handed but it was tight, it was tough. .""I don't think they were ready for the influx of that amount of people in such a short amount of time. Maybe they're used to other sporting events where people turn up in dribs and drabs. .""My worry is the logistical aspect of it - they've got a metro but it's only small, the roads aren't the best and everyone drives like a madman."" .For many fans attending the 2022 World Cup, the question of whether they will be able to drink alcohol is a significant one. .Qatar is an Islamic country and it is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in public.external-link However, it is available at licensed hotel restaurants and bars, with a legal drinking age of 21. .But Heaton said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by what he found during the Club World Cup. .""It's got to be a bit of give and take,"" he said. ""They're willing to bend to a certain degree and we've got to respect that."" .McManaman added: ""I have been here before so I know how conservative it is. And of course, people can drink. But you can only do so in certain bars and certain hotels, so a lot of people convene there. It's a mix of being conservative, but you go to certain bars and it is very westernised. .""Things will have to loosen up when the World Cup arrives. When millions of fans turn up it is going to be completely different, so you wonder what it will be like when people from all over the world, and cultures completely different from this, land here for the World Cup. .""But I do think it will be a success. I think tournaments like this really help.

18 December 2019",Liverpool at Club World Cup: Five reasons why Qatar tournament matters to Reds,".With nine games to pack in during a busy December, the last thing Liverpool need is a trip to Qatar in the middle of it all, right? .Wrong. The Club World Cup may appear to be an unnecessary inconvenience for the Reds but there are benefits that could make it an important diversion. .A last-minute Roberto Firmino goal secured a 2-1 win against Monterrey in the semi-final, meaning they face Brazilian side Flamengo on Saturday, 21 December (17:30 GMT). .The game will be live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, with the programme starting at 17.15 GMT and we at BBC Sport have put together five reasons why it is important. .No English men's professional team have ever won more than four trophies in a season. Liverpool could yet finish the campaign with five. .At the start of the season, they were in contention for seven - but the first one got away in August as they lost to Manchester City on penalties in the Community Shield before the youngest Liverpool starting XI in history lost 5-0 to Aston Villa in the EFL Cup quarter-finals. .So far, they have collected one trophy this season, beating Chelsea on penalties to win the Uefa Super Cup, but that could become two if they win the Club World Cup this week. .Meanwhile, they are 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League and still have the Champions League and the FA Cup to go for. .Don't try to tell Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp that the Club World Cup is an inconvenience. Not now he is getting a taste for success at Anfield. .""We don't take it for granted, not at all, but when we go, we want to win it,"" Klopp said in November. ""The only reason for us to go there is for the opportunity to win it, and that's what we'll try."" .Until this year, Klopp had a pretty horrible record in finals. After winning the German Cup in 2012 with Borussia Dortmund, he lost his next six major finals as a manager, culminating in Liverpool's 3-1 Champions League defeat by Real Madrid in May 2018. .Beating Tottenham in Madrid on 1 June this year to win the Champions League put an end to that run. Now he wants to keep adding the silverware. .The Club World Cup is taking place in Qatar. The 2022 World Cup is taking place in Qatar. See where we are going with this? .Plenty of the Liverpool squad are likely to return to Doha in three years with their national teams. The Club World Cup will give them the chance to get a feel for the conditions first hand - and at the right time of year. .Most of the 2022 World Cup will take place in December. Temperatures won't be as high as the 41C they can reach in the sweltering summer months, but will still reach a pretty toasty 30C. Players will get to see how their bodies deal with that sort of heat over 90 minutes. .Also, the Club World Cup final is taking place at Doha's Khalifa International Stadium, which is one of the venues for the World Cup. .All in all it should be a decent scouting expedition. .Winning the Champions League not only bagged Liverpool plenty of prestige, it also offered the chance to earn an extra £8m. .Granted, that's a drop in the ocean in today's world of football finances, but in terms of the club's previous transfer spending, think of it as one Andy Robertson or two Joe Gomezes. .Where does the £8m figure come from? Well, Liverpool's Champions League win secured their ticket to the Uefa Super Cup final and the Club World Cup. Prize money for winning each is £4m. Klopp's side have won one, now they chase the other. .Not bad for three games' work. .Finally, this is a trophy that Liverpool have never won. They played in the 2005 final but lost 1-0 to Sao Paulo. .There is also the chance for revenge. .The game with Flamengo is a rematch of the 1981 Intercontinental Cup final, the precursor to the Club World Cup. .Back then, Liverpool were beaten 3-0 in Tokyo by a Zico-inspired side. .In the 38 years since, Liverpool have won six English top-flight titles and been champions of Europe three times. But the honour of being world champions has so far eluded them. .Maybe this is their year? .",242

But there will be no flag or anthem."" .A Fifa spokesperson said football's world governing body was in contact with Wada to ""clarify the extent of the decision in regards to football"". .This has happened before - a team of Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. .The 2022 World Cup takes place from 21 November to 18 December, with European qualifying set to start in March 2021. .Despite their ban from the tournament, Russia can take part in qualifying. .Taylor added: ""Because the qualifiers don't decide the world champion, Russia can take part. The decision applies to the World Cup tournament because it decides the world champion."" .The sanctions also prevent Russia from hosting events during the ban. .St Petersburg is a host city for group games and a quarter-final at next summer's European Championship (which is being hosted by several countries), as well as staging the Uefa Champions League final in 2021. .However, it will be allowed to fulfil those obligations as European football's governing body Uefa is not defined as a ""major event organisation"" with regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches. .That also allows Russia, who have already qualified for Euro 2020, to play at the tournament.",246

26 September 2019",World Athletics Championships: GB duo cool with midnight marathons & air-con stadium,".Charlotte Purdue has been pounding a laboratory treadmill in 36C heat for the past month. .The 28-year-old told BBC Sport she had performed 10 sessions of up to 90 minutes each at the physiology department of St Mary's University, with two more remaining. The method in this madness is to avoid wilting in Friday's women's marathon at the World Championships in Doha, which is scheduled to begin a minute before midnight. .Doha's furnace-like daytime conditions - which regularly top 40C - meant organisers had little choice but to start the women's and men's races as late as possible. However, the Hampshire athlete still expects 60% humidity and for temperatures to range from 33-36C, which is why she made use of the services provided by the London university. .""The lab monitored my heart-rate, body temperature and sweat-rate, and based on those values we worked out if I was adapting to the heat - it's so far, so good,"" Purdue said before heading to Great Britain's training camp in Dubai. .""After the first session I thought I'd never be able to do this, but I quite like it now."" .Coached by Australian Nic Bideau, the former European cross-country champion is currently in rude health after a torrid 2018. Injury forced her to withdraw from the London Marathon, then she suffered cramp in a race at the European Championships and that was topped off by a virus which effectively ended her year. .In contrast, 2019 saw her become the third fastest British female marathon runner, win the London half marathon and follow that up with a fifth place at the Great North Run, where she knocked a minute off her personal best. .Unsurprisingly, Purdue sounded ebullient. .Find out how to get into athletics with our special guide. .""I came off two big build-ups, but didn't run the marathons, so it's not such a shock that I got into good shape again,"" she added. .""I'm glad it's gone better for me this season - looking back on what happened it's worked out pretty well."" .The Briton is optimistic of finishing higher than the 13th she managed two years ago in London, and Doha's marathon course might aid her in her mission. .""It's six 7km loops of the Doha Corniche,"" she said. ""It's flat so it could be quite a fast course, although if it wasn't so hot then it'd be a rapid course. .""The good thing is I love doing loads of loops. Anybody who know me from training camps knows I like loops."" .The events inside the refurbished Khalifa Stadium have also been scheduled later to factor in the weather. Unlike previous World Championships, there are no morning sessions, with the competition starting after 16:00 local time, at the earliest. .Purdue's team-mate Eilish McColgan, who will be competing in the 5,000m and 10,000m, is not worried about the heat affecting the athletes because of the air-conditioning system that will operate inside the venue. This was implemented at the Doha Diamond League event in May. .The Scot, whose mother Liz - the 1991 10,000m world champion - coaches children in Doha, told BBC Sport: ""People shouldn't freak about it too much. The temperature will probably be regulated from the low to mid 20Cs. We were running in 30C during the recent British Championships in Birmingham. .""That's why a lot of the athletes have been preparing in high altitude in Switzerland or France because they realise the stadium will be air conditioned. .""I was speaking to Qatari high jumper Mutaz Barshim who said he found it quite cold because there were constant jets of air. Of course, for us running we won't feel that."" .McColgan, 28, also passed on advice to those planning to train outside the stadium: ""I've been running in public parks because the roads are chaos. .""You also have to make sure you're covered appropriately in order to respect the culture and religion. I make sure I wear longer shorts or three-quarter length leggings, and I'll always wear a T-shirt."" .Purdue will line-up for the women's marathon at 21:59 BST on Friday and McColgan begins her campaign with the 10,000m final on Saturday at 19:10 BST.",251

The BBC has asked the company for comment. .It has always denied that beoutQ uses its frequencies to broadcast illegally and has accused beIN of being behind ""defamation attempts and misleading campaigns"". .Earlier this year, beIN Media Group director David Sugden told the BBC the beoutQ operation amounted to an ""industrial scale theft"". .Relations between Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been strained since June 2017, when many of Qatar's neighbours cut diplomatic ties with the country, accusing it of destabilising the region. .BBC sports editor Dan Roan .This may seem like a complicated dispute between TV stations in two distant countries, born out of a wider diplomatic row in the Middle East - but it actually matters a great deal to British sport. .The huge sums Qatari broadcaster beIN Sports splashes out to show English football across the region is of critical importance to Premier League clubs, whose unprecedented wealth - and thus their spending power in the transfer market - is partly down to the sale of overseas TV rights to such companies. .But that depends on broadcasters being able to fend off cross-border piracy, and this case has exposed how there are limitations when it comes to preventing such activity in a country like Saudi Arabia, where bringing legal cases has proved difficult. .The worry for football (and other sports) is that beIN might run out of patience and walk away, taking its chequebook with it. The hope from many in the industry will be that this report heaps more pressure on Saudi broadcaster Arabsat to clamp down on beoutQ, although it has always robustly denied responsibility. .It certainly makes life a little awkward for Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who previously pushed for Saudi Arabia to host some matches in an expanded 2022 World Cup, and is known to be close to the Crown Prince, but who is now expected to get tough with the country. .BeIN Sports insists it is the victim of theft, but it is no stranger to controversy itself. The network's boss Nasser Al-Khelaifi, president of Paris St-Germain football club, has been investigated in France over Qatari bids to host the World Athletics Championships, and questioned in Switzerland in relation to a bribery investigation linked to beIN Sports' deal with Fifa for World Cup rights in 2026 and 2030.

31 July 2019","Aspetar: The ultra modern, elite sports hospital that imports body parts",".Unlike many of the awe-inspiring buildings that define Qatar's capital, Aspetar is not designed to catch the eye. .It is not built in Italian marble, does not stand 50 storeys high, nor does it blink at night. It is a hidden presence in Doha's imposing skyline. .Aspetar is a hospital. Yet once you are inside, it soon becomes clear there is something quite different about this place, which is at the very cutting edge of sports injury treatment and rehabilitation. .It is a place where human body parts are imported for cutting edge medical science research and where some of the world's biggest sporting names - Angel di Maria, Neymar, Mo Farah, Yaya Toure, Amir Khan and Sam Warburton included - have been treated. .If Nasa has its Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, the sports medicine world has Aspetar. .Since opening in 2007, its goal has been to become a global leader in its field. Setting out to achieve this, they employed some of the greatest minds in sports science. .They offered state-of-the-art facilities and resources to create new equipment according to their needs. Even the operating tables were designed by Aspetar surgeons. .They brought in new technologies - such as the anti-gravity treadmill. First developed at Nasa in the 1990s, this is a running machine that supports up to 90% of a person's body weight, enabling athletes to exercise even while suffering from an ankle or knee injury, helping to maintain fitness levels during recovery. .Other parts of the hospital resemble a CGI studio set up for motion capture in a Hollywood blockbuster. In one room, patients perform physical tasks with dozens of small, spherical markers attached to their bodies. Doctors can create a 3D map of their muscles, with details on elasticity, endurance and strength recorded and saved. .This is important in assessing the risk of potential for injury, but also as a data back-up for bespoke future treatment. .After injury, the information is used to try to restore full original movement to the affected area, which will vary from person to person. Information on how joints worked before they were damaged is key to recovery. .This kind of assessment is particularly popular with football clubs, who might send players as part of specialised pre-season training regimes, or potential new signings for a full medical before a contract. Paris St-Germain are regular visitors. .""Until coming to Aspetar, I'd never been in a room where you can change the altitude,"" said PSG and Argentina winger Di Maria. .There are 25 such rooms at the facility, each with an altitude switch that can be adjusted to simulate conditions from between 500m and 4,500m above sea level. They use a filtration system to reduce the concentration of oxygen in the air. .Aspetar's 'altitude pavilion' has machines to test the bodies in action, but also dormitories for rest. Heart rate and blood pressure can be monitored during, before and after activity, allowing specialists to observe any potential issues in various conditions. .At the same time, by stimulating the body to increase red blood cell production, this section of the hospital is also used for rehabilitation and altitude training. .""Athletes can spend two to three days here in the dormitories, using their gadgets and watching TV, but they are connected to electrodes 24 hours day,"" explains an Aspetar guide. .Led by their specialists, Aspetar also created the Visiting Surgeons Programme as a postgraduate experience for doctors from all over the world. .But to become knee, cartilage or shoulder surgeons, and reach Aspetar's levels of excellence, doctors also needed to practice. In 2016, the Sports Surgery Training Centre was opened, the world's first to specialise in this area. .To hone their skills, surgeons do not use replica body parts but ""specimens"", as one of the leading surgeons proudly explains, pointing to the freezer. .In a highly bureaucratic process that involves the joint work of six government ministries, real human body parts (mostly shoulders, knees, ankles and torsos) are imported to Aspetar, with most of the supply coming from the United States. .In the rehabilitation centre, next to a footballer performing underwater movements in a pool, a skier is testing himself on different slope machines, alongside basketball players performing jumps. .""The fact that they are together, seeing each other's effort and suffering together, creates a special energy,"" says Barry White, a former NBA basketball player who is now a physical coach at the hospital. .""Psychology is vital in overcoming the fear of a new injury. But it's also important to keep the body and the mind trained, even when you're injured,"" he adds. ""That's why we use underwater exercise, massages and techniques that allow the rest of the body to be trained, protecting the injured zone."" .The rehab centre is built along curved lines. There are distinct areas but no walls and it has blurred glass instead of mirrors. White worked with architects to decide every aspect of the design, from floors to ceilings, lights, windows, even the plants. .""We didn't want this to look like a gym, it's something completely different,"" he says. .But it's not just treatment and work on injury prevention that makes Aspetar unique. It's also research. .Since its first medical paper was published in 2007, more than 150 peer-reviewed research studies have been published every year. Conferences, visits and workshops take place throughout the calendar. .The collective data is processed to establish patterns across various sports, from cycling to athletics, rugby to football, spanning all ages and genders. .It informs the work of each of the hospital's specialised departments, from dental (which can be a crucial part of injury treatment that is often overlooked) to the Sports Groin Pain Centre.external-link .""Even in Europe they don't have anything similar. It has everything that a high-level athlete can need,"" said another of Aspetar's patients, former Manchester City midfielder Toure. .After having foot surgery, NBA player Joel Embiid flew 12 hours from the US to come for treatment. His Philadelphia 76ers manager Brett Brown was impressed. .He said: ""It's very holistic, all designed to his health: from diet assessment, things to do with his foot as far as bone density and massage therapy and expected soreness, education on his sleep habits, his sleep patterns etc."" .Premier League football team Tottenham Hotspur, Algeria's national team, Brazil superstar Neymar, athlete Farah, boxer Khan and Welsh rugby union player Warburton have all also come for treatment too. More than 35,000 athletes a year visit Aspetar. .In 2014, it was recognised as an International Olympic Committee Research Centre for prevention of injuries and protection of athlete health. The creation of the Sport Concussion Programmeexternal-link was another milestone. Fifa declared it medical centre of excellence 10 years ago. .The athletes learn, share and heal. And they come back. It seems like word of mouth has helped has Aspetar to grow and keep growing. .""The greatest thing about Aspetar is that we come from different countries, with different methods and backgrounds, and we've all worked to create a new thing,"" says White. .""Something that did not exist before in sports medicine and sports rehab."" .",257

He is absolutely confident about what's next."" .Fifa said it was aware of Platini's questioning, but added it was ""not in a position to comment further"". .Platini was banned over a 2m Swiss francs (£1.3m) ""disloyal payment"" from Blatter, who was also banned from football for his part in the matter. Blatter has also always denied any wrongdoing. .Platini's eight-year ban was later reduced to four on appeal and will expire in October 2019. .Qatar's bid team has been previously accused of corruption, but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. .However, former Football Association chairman Greg Dyke told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the decision to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup was a ""bizarre"" one. .""I think anyone who was involved in that decision has to be questioned because it was such a bizarre decision,"" he said. .""It was against the advice of their own technical committee, who said they didn't think it would be safe - and as we now know they have had to move it to the winter to make it safe. And Qatar didn't meet all sorts of criteria, so it was always a very odd decision. .""I like Michel Platini. I thought he was a good leader for Uefa and he was a very likeable, charismatic man. .""In some ways it's sad that this is being dragged up again but if you look at the wider picture of why was that World Cup awarded to Qatar, there are still so many questions to be answered."" .BBC sports editor Dan Roan .This is the result of two years of work by French investigators from the country's serious financial crime unit, who - just like their counterparts in the US and Switzerland - have been looking into allegations of corruption connected to Fifa's shock decision to award Qatar the World Cup in 2022. .Given that Blatter has been interviewed as part of the same case, it is no surprise that Platini is also now facing questions. .It is understood these will focus on a lunch Platini attended in Paris just days before that hugely controversial vote in 2010, with the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy at his official residence and the Qatari head of state. .It has long been suspected that the prospect of important bilateral trade deals between the two nations, and the subsequent Qatari takeover of Paris St-Germain may have been used as leverage to get Sarkozy's support. .Platini has always denied that was why he changed his mind to vote for Qatar (rather than the US). .Given how much time has now passed since the 2010 vote, and how much has changed at Fifa, there seems no real prospect that this latest development could affect Qatar's status as hosts, even if Platini is charged. .Fifa's own 2014 internal investigation effectively cleared Qatar of corruption, and stripping it of the event at this stage could leave it open to legal action. .But yet again it does serve as a reminder of the scandal and suspicion that surrounds the saga of how Qatar won the right to stage the event. .Back in 2015, when still one of the sport's most powerful figures, Platini told me he had ""no regrets"" about voting for Qatar, despite the allegations of corruption and human rights abuses directed against the country, and the havoc a winter tournament would play with the European game he represented at the time. .He may feel differently now.",261

22 May 2019",World Cup: Fifa drops plans to expand Qatar 2022 to 48 teams,".Plans to expand the 2022 World Cup to 48 teams have been abandoned by Fifa. .Fifa president Gianni Infantino said last year the expansion from 32 teams could be brought forward from 2026 to the 2022 tournament in Qatar. .The change would have required Qatar to share hosting duties with other countries in the region. .World football's governing body said after a ""thorough and comprehensive consultation process"" the change ""could not be made now"". .Fifa also said it explored the possibility of Qatar hosting a 48-team tournament on its own but has decided not to pursue those plans as there was not enough time ""for a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact"". .In a statement, Qatari World Cup organisers said: ""Qatar had always been open to the idea of an expanded tournament in 2022 had a viable operating model been found and had all parties concluded that an expanded 48-team edition was in the best interest of football and Qatar as the host nation. .""With just three and a half years to go until kick off, Qatar remains as committed as ever to ensuring the 32-team Fifa World Cup in 2022 is one of the best tournaments ever and one that makes the entire Arab world proud."" .In November, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said adding 16 teams to Qatar 2022 could create ""many problems"" and described the idea as ""quite unrealistic"". .BBC sports editor Dan Roan .Those close to the Qatar 2022 organisers say this is a mutual decision that realigns them and Fifa, and that they are now concentrating on delivering the best possible 32-team World Cup. .But it will also have come as a major relief to the hosts, who no longer have to worry about sharing football's showpiece event. .Perhaps with the Nobel Peace Prize in mind, Fifa president Gianni Infantino had pushed for an expansion against Qatar's wishes, hoping it may help heal diplomatic tensions in the region by staging some games in other countries, but he has now had to admit defeat. .With Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain all maintaining a blockade of neighbouring Qatar, such an audacious move was never going to be straightforward. .The crisis left only Kuwait and Oman as potential co-hosts, but a Fifa study concluded that neither would meet all logistical requirements. .Infantino has previously collaborated with Saudi Arabia when proposing a revamped Club World Cup, and many suspected this was linked to his suggestion that the country could be part of the solution for an expanded 2022 tournament. .But given the condemnation that followed the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the country's consulate in Istanbul last year, along with its role in Yemen's bloody civil war, such a step would have sparked a major backlash from human rights campaigners, as it would have done if the UAE had been awarded games. .So while some national football associations and Infantino will no doubt be disappointed at the news, many others will welcome it. .In January 2017, Fifa voted unanimously in favour of increasing the World Cup to 48 teams for the 2026 event - which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico. .In October 2018 Infantino said ""we have to see if it is possible"" to bring the expansion forward to 2022. .Infantino has been a strong advocate of the expansion and said the World Cup has to be ""more inclusive"". .""We are in the 21st century and we have to shape the World Cup of the 21st century,"" he said when announcing the change. .""It is the future. Football is more than just Europe and South America, football is global."" .The expansion in 2026 will see an initial stage of 16 groups of three teams precede a knockout stage for the remaining 32. .The number of tournament matches will rise to 80, from 64, but the eventual winners will still play only seven games. .The tournament will be completed within 32 days - a measure to appease powerful European clubs, who objected to reform because of a crowded international schedule. .",265

6 May 2019",Burnley fan who ran to every Premier League away game this season seeks new challenge,".Three thousand and ninety miles covered, 5.6 million steps taken and 15 pairs of trainers worn out. .Little more than 48 hours have passed since Burnley fan Scott Cunliffe completed his challenge of running to all 19 of their away league matches this season, yet he already has an idea for his next challenge... .Running to the Qatar World Cup in 2022. .""England have got to get there first, though,"" he says. .For his charity, RunAway Challenge, Cunliffe has run for 735 hours across 100 days, covering the distance of 118 marathons, setting off each time from Burnley's Turf Moor ground. .He completed the feat on Friday, arriving at Goodison Park for the Clarets' 2-0 defeat by Everton. He admits to having a tear in his eye as he received a standing ovation at half-time, but it wasn't the 48-mile route that gave him jelly legs - rather, being invited into the Burnley dressing roomexternal-link by manager Sean Dyche. .""I think my legs were more wobbly going into the dressing room than they were running the last few miles,"" Cunliffe, 45, tells BBC Sport. .""It was amazing, a really nice gesture. It was heartfelt from everyone in there, it was really genuine. I was very touched."" .Now that it's over, Cunliffe can view his achievement through rose-tinted glasses. He's raised more than £24,000 for charity, boosted his confidence and strengthened both physically and mentally. .But he's also had to face some of his biggest phobias head on, and deal with the mental peaks and troughs he's faced when pounding out mile after mile. .""I'm feeling relieved, from both a physical and mental perspective, that I actually did it,"" he says. .""I'm very proud of the achievement, and excited to see how people's lives change with the money that is coming in. I'm excited to see the fruits of my labour come through."" .Cunliffe decided to combine his love of following Burnley with a passion for running ultra marathons when he returned to England in 2018 after two decades working for charities in South East Asia. .While in Indonesia and East Timor, he witnessed violent conflicts and poverty-stricken environments that led to him developing post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. .Running proved his salvation, but on this challenge it forced him to confront his biggest phobia - motorway bridges. .""It's very minute distance-wise - the biggest thing I was thinking about on a 270-mile run to Bournemouth was the 50m over-the-motorway bridge,"" he says. ""I would be fretting every day I had to go over one. .""Even on my run to Liverpool, I went over a motorway bridge and I grabbed on to the guy who was running with me as we went over it. .""It's a feeling of floating off when I go over these bridges and it's really noisy and a long drop down. I've had quite a few moments with that. .""Sometimes I tried to avoid going over the motorway and tried to go under it, sometimes I'd have to go a mile out of the way just to find the underpass."" .At times, Cunliffe wished the season away. He wanted the challenge to be done and dusted. But giving up? .""I never felt like quitting, that was never a question,"" he says. .So many will reap the benefits of Cunliffe's achievement. The money he has raised will go to Premier League clubs' charities, such as Burnley FC in the Community, that offer innovative activities to improve the mental and physical health of disadvantaged people. .But he has also benefited himself. The mental challenge that lay before him at the start was far greater than the physical challenge, but he has defied it from every angle. .""At the start of the challenge, I was probably the best I had been for a while and I have maintained that,"" he says. .""I haven't had any panic attacks throughout the whole season and I've been feeling really good. .""I've been off medication for a good year-and-a-half now. If anything, I've got better and a lot of that is through the love I've received from people and feeling the support from fans across the country."" .Remarkably, Cunliffe remained largely injury-free throughout all 19 runs, and has been boosted by all that comes with his astounding feat. .""I'm definitely more confident and stronger, both physically and mentally,"" he says. ""I'm probably a slower runner than I was before, though. .""Britain is a good place; there are so many good people out there. Especially at a time when there is a lot of division in the country, there is a lot of good out there."" .Old habits die hard. Cunliffe is likely to travel to Burnley's away games by any other form of transport than his own two feet next season but he says he may run to ""one or two"". .He's got a new challenge he ""wants to have a crack at"" in three years' time, running the approximate 4,350 miles to Qatar, where the next World Cup will be held. .""It's been amazing to see the football fans warming to running, and hopefully runners will warm to football,"" he says. ""So why not continue that?"" .""I don't want to do something immediately, but this gives enough time as it will take a lot of planning. There's a lot of security and logistical planning we'd need to do to make sure it was viable, with going through the Middle East and the desert. .""After the last World Cup, it was such a galvanising thing for England, so it would be great to celebrate them at the next World Cup."" .As for Burnley, Cunliffe admits it's been an ""up and down season"". Currently 15th in the table, their Premier League status is assured for next term but just like their star fan, they have shown great ""resilience"". .""It's been an amazing show of resilience to come back from not having a good start to actually being one of the better teams in the last part of the season,"" he says. .""Pride has been restored in the team; we haven't been everyone's favourite team with the style our football is played but we are an amazing club. .""Legs, hearts and minds, that's what it's all about and that's what I have gained from it.""",267

The ILO has also set up an office in Doha to cooperate on labour-related issues. .The study is largely focused on government infrastructure projects, rather than World Cup construction sites, but it says that workers continue to be vulnerable to serious abuses, ""sometimes amounting to forced labour and human trafficking"". .It also said that despite promises of reform, and some improvements, there has been ""no meaningful reform of the 'kafala' sponsorship system"", which ties workers to their employer. Qatar promised to abolish kafala, described by human rights groups as modern-day slavery, in 2016. .Amnesty said that in addition to country-wide reforms, around 30,000 workers on projects specifically for the World Cup were supposed to have benefitted from stricter labour standards, ethical recruitment, timely payment, the banning of forced labour and new accommodation. .It concluded that while these had led to ""some real improvements"", they were ""not universally respected"", and that last year World Cup organisers admitted that contractors working on one of the stadiums had breached a summer working hours ban. .An audit of 19 contractors working on World Cup sites also found that abuses such as excessive working hours remained at a majority of the companies. .Amnesty director Stephen Cockburn said: ""Time is running out if the Qatari authorities want to deliver a legacy we can all cheer… a labour system that ends the abuse and misery inflicted upon so many migrant workers. .""The authorities have been taking some important steps to protect labour rights but much more needs to be done. Holes in the reforms mean many workers are still stuck in harsh conditions."" .The Amnesty report came as Fifa hailed an important milestone in preparations for the 2022 World Cup, with the creation of a joint venture with Qatari organisers responsible for the delivery of the tournament in less than four years' time. .Qatar has also been celebrating its national team winning the Asian Cup for the first time. .Amnesty calls on Fifa to ""proactively seek to influence the Qatari authorities to fully and quickly deliver on their promised reforms so that the protection of all migrant workers may be a positive legacy of the World Cup"". .The Fifa statement added: ""Fifa continues to engage with the supreme committee for delivery and legacy and other parties towards ensuring respect for the rights of workers who are involved in Fifa World Cup-related activities. .""As part of these and other human rights-related efforts, we are in regular contact with Amnesty International."" .Last month Hassan Al-Thawadi - head of the Qatar 2022 organising committee - told the BBC that there was ""room for improvement"" on worker pay, but said there was plans for a minimum wage and that progress on reforms would continue.",272

1 February 2019",Asian Cup winners Qatar impress three years out from hosting 2022 World Cup,".Qatar thoroughly deserved to win the Asian Cup. .With their victory and the manner of their performances, they have sat the world down and told it face-to-face that they will be more than mere hosts of the World Cup in 2022. .They were the only consistent team in the competition, scoring more and conceding fewer than everyone else. .They already had the Asian player of the year, in marauding left-back Abdelkarim Hassan. .To him they've added the Golden Boot-winner in Almoez Ali, and Akram Afif, who was the leading assist-provider. .Due to the blockade of Qatar by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, it's almost impossible for Qataris to enter the Emirates. .That has meant that the Maroons, as they're known, have been the ultimate away team. .When they played North Korea in a group match, the official attendance was 452. .When they played Saudi Arabia, their anthem was booed. .And when they played the UAE in a semi-final in which the hosts were humbled 4-0, shoes were thrown at them. .Russia reached the quarter finals of their World Cup after years of indifferent results. If Qatar stay on the same track, imagine what they could do. .The next turf for them to stomp all over will be in South America, when they take on Paraguay, Colombia and Argentina as an invited guest to the Copa America. .The Asian Cup has been a tournament marked by mediocrity, with swathes of forgettable football leaving behind nothing more than blank patches of memory. .But a tournament in a country the size of the United Arab Emirates has also given a glimpse of what the 2022 World Cup might be like for football-hungry fans in an equally small nation. .The proximity of stadia meant that when the knockout stage began, fans and journalists could go to more than one match in a day. .As the last 16 began, I went to Jordan-Vietnam in early afternoon in Dubai and, despite extra-time and penalties, made it to Iran-Oman an hour and a half away in Abu Dhabi in the evening. .The distances in Qatar will be even shorter, which should make it easy for their coach Felix Sanchez to visit his winner's medal as often as he likes. .He says he'll put it in his office so he can do just that. .Sanchez now joins fellow Spaniards Luis Aragones and Vicente del Bosque as a continental champion. .Qatar's success in the UAE has come against adversity, but it is also the result of eye-watering investment. .Two thirds of Qatar's squad grew up together as scholars in the world-class Aspire academy that has also produced the reigning high jump world champion Mutaz Essa Barshim. .Sanchez says that victory over Japan is a vindication of Qatar's extraordinary investment in football. .""A lot of things have been done the right way and this group of players have been going in the right direction with the right mentality,"" he said. ""We are feeling very proud about that."" .The pre-final appeal by the UAE to have Qatar thrown out of the tournament for fielding ineligible players is a reminder that the Qataris' past practice of liberal naturalisation has only recently ended. .For many years, Qatar's national team was known sneeringly and rather hypocritically by its Arab neighbours as the 'United Nations of Qatar'. .In those days, Qatar would bring a Latin American feel to Asian football, but only via the teamsheet. .But in the current squad, the overwhelming majority of players were born in the country. .The Qatar Football Association decided that using swiftly-naturalised players was nothing more than a quick fix. .What it needed was a generation of players with a native attachment to the country, who will be around for years to come. .So stand up Akram Afif, Abdelkarim Hassan and the rest.",274

On board are staterooms, lounges, boardrooms, first class seating areas, and even a hospital. .After the jet landed in Turkey last week, an opposition MP tabled a parliamentary question asking Vice-President Fuat Oktay to disclose whether it had been purchased by the state. .Speaking to reporters flying with him from Azerbaijan to Turkey over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said Qatar's emir had given the plane as a gift after learning that the Turkish government had expressed an interest in it. .""He said: 'I won't take money from Turkey. I give this as a present to Turkey',"" the president quoted Sheikh Hamad as saying. .Mr Erdogan told reporters the plane was being repainted, adding: ""God willing, we can have a trip with it when all is over."" .Last month, Qatar's emir approved a package of economic projects, investments and deposits worth $15bn (£11.4bn) to support Turkey's economy and currency. .The Turkish lira has lost almost 40% of its value against the dollar this year, driven by worries over Mr Erdogan's influence on monetary policy and a diplomatic row with the United States. .Qatar crisis: What's it about? .Erdogan demands swift end to Qatar crisis .Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar? .Five surprising facts about Qatar .Who lives in a £385m house like this?",290

There have been attacks since, including one on army check points in Badghis province. .The meeting was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Two senior Taliban sources confirmed it to the BBC's Mahfouz Zubaide, in Kabul. They said a six-member delegation was led by Abbas Stanikzai, who heads the group's political office in Doha. .The US department of state has confirmed that Ms Wells, of the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, was in Qatar last week to meet government officials and talk about an Afghan peace process but did not confirm or deny the Taliban meeting. .One of the Taliban officials described the talks as a ""preliminary"" discussion to set up a channel between the group and senior US officials ahead of further meetings. Neither would provide further details. .Another official told Reuters news agency: ""We agreed to meet again soon and resolve the Afghan conflict through dialogue"". .There are reports that two other meetings have taken place but this could not be confirmed. .The Taliban are reported to have insisted that no Afghan officials should be present at the meeting with Ms Wells. The US has previously insisted that Afghan officials must be part of peace talks. .The US invaded Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the 11 September attacks, ousting the Taliban from power and setting the stage for what has turned into a 17-year conflict. .President Donald Trump re-committed the US to the war in a new strategy last year, and stepped up air strikes against the militants to try to force them to the negotiating table. .A previous attempt at direct talks in Doha failed in 2013, when then Afghan President Hamid Karzai became angry that the Taliban were flying a flag outside their new Qatar office and using the name of the Islamic state they founded when they came to power in the 1990s - the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. .Deadly Afghan attack targets midwives .Afghan civilian deaths 'hit record high' .Nato summit tackles Afghan conflict .Taliban 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' .Afghanistan country profile .Cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan",291

294,70,17 July 2018,'Billion dollar ransom': Did Qatar pay record sum?,".On the morning of 16 December 2015 Qatar's ruling family got bad news: 28 members of a royal hunting party had been kidnapped in Iraq. .A list of the hostages was given to Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who was about to become Qatar's foreign minister. He realised that it included two of his own relatives. .""Jassim is my cousin and Khaled is my aunt's husband,"" he texted Qatar's ambassador to Iraq, Zayed al-Khayareen. ""May God protect you: once you receive any news, update me immediately."" .The two men would spend the next 16 months consumed by the hostage crisis. .In one version of events, they would pay more than a billion dollars to free the men. The money would go to groups and individuals labelled ""terrorists"" by the US: Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq, which killed American troops with roadside bombs; General Qasem Soleimani, leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force and personally subject to US and EU sanctions; and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once known as al-Nusra Front, when it was an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria. .In another version of events - Qatar's own - no money was paid to ""terrorists"", only to the Iraqi state. .In this version, the money still sits in the Central Bank of Iraq's vault in Baghdad, though all the hostages are home. The tortuous story of the negotiations emerges, line by line, in texts and voicemails sent between the foreign minister and the ambassador. .These were obtained by a government hostile to Qatar and passed to the BBC. .So, did Qatar pay the biggest ransom in history? .Sheikh Mohammed is a former economist and a distant relative of the emir. He was not well known before he was promoted to foreign minister at the relatively young age of 35. .At the time of the kidnapping, the ambassador Zayed al-Khayareen was in his 50s, and was said to have held the rank of colonel in Qatari intelligence. He was Qatar's first envoy to Iraq in 27 years, but this was not an important post. .The crisis was his chance to improve his position. .The hostages had gone to Iraq to hunt with falcons. They were warned - implored - not to go. But falconry is the sport of kings in the Gulf and there were flocks of the falcons' prey, the Houbara bustard, in the empty expanse of southern Iraq. .The hunters' camp was overrun by pick-up trucks mounted with heavy machine guns in the early hours of the morning. .A former hostage told the New York Times they thought it was ""Isis"", the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State. But then one of the kidnappers used a Shia insult to Sunnis. .For many agonising weeks, the Qatari government heard nothing. But in March 2016, things started to move. Officials learned that the kidnappers were from Kataib Hezbollah (the Party of God Brigades), an Iraqi Shia militia supported by Iran. .The group wanted money. Ambassador Khayareen texted Sheikh Mohammed: ""I told them, 'Give us back 14 of our people... and we will give you half of the amount.'"" The ""amount"" is not clear in the phone records at this stage. .Five days later, the group offered to release three hostages. ""They want a gesture of goodwill from us as well,"" the ambassador wrote. ""This is a good sign... that they are in a hurry and want to end everything soon."" .Two days later the ambassador was in the Green Zone in Baghdad, a walled off and heavily guarded part of the city where the Iraqi government and foreign embassies are located. .Iraq in March is already hot. The atmosphere in the Green Zone would have seemed especially stifling: supporters of the Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr were at the gates, protesting about corruption. The staff of some embassies had fled, the ambassador reported. This provided a tense backdrop to the negotiations. .Mr Khayareen waited. But there was no sign of the promised release. He wrote: ""This is the third time that I come to Baghdad for the hostages' case and I have never felt frustrated like this time. I've never felt this stressed. I don't want to leave without the hostages. :( :("" .The kidnappers turned up, not with hostages but with a USB memory stick containing a video of a solitary captive. .""What guarantee do we have that the rest are with them?"" Sheikh Mohammed asked the ambassador. ""Delete the video from your phone... Make sure it doesn't leak, to anyone."" .Mr Khayareen agreed, saying: ""We don't want their families to watch the video and get emotionally affected."" .The hostages had been split up - the royals were put in a windowless basement; their friends, the other non-royals, and the non-Qataris in the party, were taken elsewhere and given better treatment and food. .A Qatari official told me that the royals were moved around, sometimes every two to three days, but always kept somewhere underground. They had only a single Koran to read between them. .For almost the entire 16 months they spent in captivity, they had no idea what was happening in the outside world. .If money was the answer to this problem, at least the Qataris had it. But the texts and voicemails show that the kidnappers added to their demands, changing them, going backwards and forwards: Qatar should leave the Saudi-led coalition battling Shia rebels in Yemen. Qatar should secure the release of Iranian soldiers held prisoner by rebels in Syria. .Then it was money again. And as well as the main ransom, the militia commanders wanted side payments for themselves. .As one session of talks ended, a Kataib Hezbollah negotiator, Abu Mohammed, apparently took the ambassador aside and asked for $10m (£7.6m) for himself. .""Abu Mohammed asked, 'What's in it for me? Frankly I want 10',"" the ambassador said in a voicemail. .""I told him, 'Ten? I am not giving you 10. Only if you get my guys done 100%...' .""To motivate him, I also told him that I am willing to buy him an apartment in Lebanon."" .The ambassador used two Iraqi mediators, both Sunnis. They visited the Qatari foreign minister, asking in advance for ""gifts"": $150,000 in cash and five Rolex watches, ""two of the most expensive kind, three of regular quality"". It's not clear if these gifts were for the mediators themselves or were to grease the kidnappers' palms as the talks continued. .In April 2016, the phone records were peppered with a new name: Qasem Soleimani, Kataib Hezbollah's Iranian patron. .By now, the ransom demand appears to have reached the astonishing sum of $1bn. Even so, the kidnappers held out for more. The ambassador texted the foreign minister: ""Soleimani met with the kidnappers yesterday and pressured them to take the $1b. They didn't respond because of their financial condition... Soleimani will go back."" .The ambassador texted again that the Iranian general was ""very upset"" with the kidnappers. ""They want to exhaust us and force us to accept their demands immediately. We need to stay calm and not to rush."" But, he told Sheikh Mohammed, ""You need to be ready with $$$$."" The minister replied: ""God helps!"" .Months passed. Then in November 2016, a new element entered the negotiations. Gen Soleimani wanted Qatar to help implement the so-called ""four towns agreement"" in Syria. .At the time, two Sunni towns held by the rebels were surrounded by the Syrian government, which is supported by Iran. Meanwhile, two Shia towns loyal to the government were also under siege by Salafist rebels, who were apparently supported by Qatar. (The rebels were said to include members of the former al-Nusra Front.) Under the agreement, the sieges of the four towns would be lifted and their populations evacuated. .According to the ambassador, Gen Soleimani told Kataib Hezbollah that if Shia were saved because of the four towns agreement, it would be ""shameful"" to demand personal bribes. .""Hezbollah Lebanon, and Kataib Hezbollah Iraq, all want money and this is their chance,"" the ambassador texted the foreign minister. ""They are using this situation to benefit... especially that they know that it's nearly the end... All of them are thieves."" .The last mention in the exchanges of a $1bn ransom is in January 2017, along with another figure - $150m. .The government that gave us this material - which is hostile to Qatar - believes the discussions between Sheikh Mohammed and Mr Khayareen were about $1bn in ransom plus $150m in side payments, or ""kickbacks"". But the texts are ambiguous. It could be that the four towns deal was what was required to free the hostages, plus $150m in personal payments to the kidnappers. .Qatari officials accept that the texts and voicemails are genuine, though they believe they have been edited ""very selectively"" to give a misleading impression. .The transcripts were leaked, to the Washington Post, in April 2018. Our sources waited until officials in Doha issued denials. Then they sought to embarrass Qatar by releasing the original audio recordings. .Qatar is under economic blockade by some of its neighbours - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. This regional dispute has produced an intensive, and expensive, campaign of hacking, leaking and briefings in Washington and London. .The hostage crisis was brought to an end in April 2017. A Qatar Airways plane flew to Baghdad to deliver money and bring the hostages back. This was confirmed by Qatari officials, though Qatar Airways itself declined to comment. .Qatar is in a legal dispute with its neighbours about overflight rights. The question of whether the emirate's national carrier was used to make payments to ""terrorists"" will have a bearing on the case - one reason, presumably, why we were leaked this material. .Who would get the cash flown into Baghdad - and how much was there? Our original source - the government opposed to Qatar - maintains that it was more than $1bn, plus $150m in kickbacks, much of it destined for Kataib Hezbollah. .Qatari officials confirm that a large sum in cash was sent - but they say it was for the Iraqi government, not terrorists. The payments were for ""economic development"" and ""security co-operation"". ""We wanted to make the Iraqi government fully responsible for the hostages' safety,"" the officials say. .The Qataris thought they had made a deal with the Iraqi interior minister. He was waiting at the airport when the plane landed with its cargo of cash in black duffel bags. Then armed men swept in, wearing military uniforms without insignia. .""We still don't know who they were,"" a Qatari official told me. ""The interior minister was pushed out."" This could only be a move by the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, they reasoned. The Qatari prime minister frantically called Mr Abadi. He did not pick up. .Mr Abadi later held a news conference, saying that he had taken control of the cash. .Although the money had been seized, the hostage release went ahead anyway, tied to implementation of the ""four towns agreement"". .In the texts, a Qatari intelligence officer, Jassim Bin Fahad Al Thani - presumably a member of the royal family - was present on the ground. .First, ""46 buses"" took people from the two Sunni towns in Syria. ""We took out 5,000 people over two days,"" Jassim Bin Fahad texted. ""Now we are taking 3,000... We don't want any bombings."" .A few days later, the Shia towns were evacuated. Sheikh Mohammed sent a text that ""3,000 [Shia] are being held in exchange location... when we have seen our people, I will let the buses move."" .The ambassador replied that the other side was worried. ""They are panicking. They said that if the sun rises [without the Shia leaving] they will take our people back."" .On 21 April 2017, the Qatari hostages were released. All were ""fine"", the ambassador reported, but ""they lost almost half of their weight"". The ambassador arranged for the plane taking them home to have ""biryani and kabsa, white rice and sauté... Not for me. The guys are missing this food."" .Sixteen months after they were taken, television pictures showed the hostages, gaunt but smiling, on the tarmac at Doha airport. .The sources for the texts and voicemails - officials from a government hostile to Qatar - say the material shows that ""Qatar sent money to terrorists"". .Shortly after the money was flown to Baghdad, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt began their economic blockade of Qatar. They still accuse Qatar of having a ""long history"" of financing ""terrorism"". .The anti-Qatar sources point to one voicemail from Ambassador Khayareen. In it, he describes telling a Kataib Hezbollah leader: ""You should trust Qatar, you know what Qatar did, what His Highness the Emir's father did... He did many things, this and that, and paid 50 million, and provided infrastructure for the south, and he was the first one who visited."" .Our sources maintain that this shows an historic payment, under the old emir, of $50m to Kataib Hezbollah. .Qatari officials say it shows support for Shia in general. .Whether the blockade of Qatar continues will depend on who wins the argument over ""terrorist financing"". .Partly, this is a fight over whom to believe about how a kidnapping in the Iraqi desert was ended. Qatari officials say the money they flew to Baghdad remains in a vault in the Iraqi central bank ""on deposit"". .Their opponents say that the Iraqi government inserted itself into the hostage deal and distributed the money. .For the time being, the mystery over whether Qatar did make the biggest ransom payment in history remains unsolved. .Update 17 July 2018: Since the article was published, a Qatari official told the BBC the payment of $50m by the Qatari emir's father was for humanitarian aid. The official said: ""Qatar has a history of providing humanitarian aid for people in need regardless of religion or race. Whether they were Sunni or Shia did not factor into the decisions."" .Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims .Qatari hunting party freed in Iraq .Qatari hunters kidnapped in Iraq .Pakistan enforces bustard hunting ban",294

297,73,26 April 2018,Cardiff Airport government cash 'could be recouped' by 2021,".All money invested in Cardiff Airport by the Welsh Government could be recouped by 2021, according to its chairman. .The government bought the airport for £52m in 2013 as it struggled with falling passenger numbers. .But speaking to the assembly's economy committee, Roger Lewis said its own forecasts suggested it could be worth £117m by 2020/2021. .Despite this, Mr Lewis ""strongly urged"" it to keep hold of the asset. .Two million passengers used the airport in 2007 but by 2012 that figure had halved, prompting the Welsh Government to step in. .Under its stewardship passenger numbers climbed back to 1.5m in 2017. .It is hoped new routes, including one to Doha with Qatar Airways, will help continue the growth. .Mr Lewis told the committee the airport's ""organic growth"" would see two million using it annually by March 2020. .Based on the airport's own profit forecasts, he said it could potentially be valued between £88m and £117m by the financial year 2020/21. .He said this would mean if the Welsh Government wanted to, it could sell the airport in 2021 and make back all money it has paid. .However, when pressed by Llanelli AM Lee Waters if this would be the sensible course, he said it should keep some control. .""My advice to the Welsh Government would be to retain this asset,"" he said. .""But to look for equity investment and construct a model that the Welsh Government has the checks, controls and balances to ensure it doesn't have a situation where it encountered last time that the asset was sweated to an extent it was virtually dying."" .The airport's latest financial results, for 2016-17, showed a pre-tax loss of £5.97m, an increase on the £4.9m pre-tax loss the previous year. .The Welsh Government has made loans of £10m to improve the terminal and £13m for route development. .In March it put £6m into the airport in exchange for shares in the business. .Doha flights cut due to new plane delays .Government buys airport for £52m .New terminal plan for Cardiff Airport .Cardiff 'central' to airline's plans .Qatar flights from Cardiff confirmed",297

Now, Baladna farm has 10,000 cattle. Most come from top breeders in the United States. .The first cows were flown in on Qatar Airways, a month after the start of the Gulf crisis, when this tiny state was put under a land blockade by its Arab neighbours. .They have become a symbol of national pride for Qatar in its new push for self-reliance. .""Everybody said it cannot be done and we have done it,"" says Peter Weltevreden who manages the farm. .""Our promise was that a year after the siege we would be self-sufficient in fresh milk."" .On 5 June last year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off all diplomatic, trade and transport links to Qatar. .Qatar's foreign minister interviewed in 2018 .They accused it of supporting terrorism, stirring up regional instability and seeking close ties with their arch-rival, Iran. .Qatar denied that and refused to comply with a long list of demands, including closing its Al Jazeera news network. .This wealthy emirate has since used its vast riches from offshore gas to find ways around its isolation, and sees the boycott as a challenge to its sovereignty. .""The main thing that the blockading states are aiming for [is] a power consolidation in the region,"" Qatar's Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, tells me. .""They started to draw the picture of terrorist on anyone who is different from them."" .Qatar blames the start of last year's crisis on what it says was a cyber-attack on its state-run news agency, which published comments purportedly from the ruling emir. .He was quoted as expressing sympathy for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, and claiming that Donald Trump might not last long as US president. .However, analysts say the roots of the disagreement go back much further. .""This was an issue that was kept bottled for 20 years but it just came out in the open a year ago,"" says Ali Shihabi, the Saudi founder of the Washington-based, Arabia Foundation. .He refers to tapes that emerged after the fall of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 which appeared to show the Qatari emir's father plotting against Saudi royals when he was ruler. .Mr Shihabi says that Qatar reneged on agreements to stop payments to dissidents in other Arab countries and gave them a platform on Al Jazeera. .""Qatar with 300,000 citizens has taken on the 22 million citizens of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, the biggest Arab country by far,"" Mr Shihabi says. .""It is a little brother and you shouldn't play bigger than you are, because ultimately that backfires and causes problems."" .For now, Qatar is finding ways around the land blockade. .It opened a new $7bn (£5.2nb) port on the Gulf coast, earlier than previously planned. This is helping to shield its economy from sanctions imposed by its neighbours. .The port is now being used to import building materials for the 2022 World Cup stadiums, keeping construction on track. .But Qatar is also being pushed closer to Iran - with which it shares a maritime border and its largest gas field. Qatari planes now rely on access to Iranian airspace. .""Iran is our neighbour. We have to have co-operation and communication with them,"" says Mr al-Thani. ""We have differences with them on policies in the region but this cannot be solved by confrontation."" .The US - which initially backed the Saudi-led side in this dispute - has recently been calling for Arab Gulf unity as it tries to build support for new sanctions against Iran. .There is a large US military airbase in Qatar. .In Doha's historic market, Souq Waqif, Qataris hope for an end to the blockade which has cut them off from relatives and friends from other parts of the region. .""The Gulf states are all connected through marriages,"" says one man, who has a Saudi wife, now unable to visit her mother in Riyadh. ""It's painful to be separated from our families."" .However, there is defiance too and a renewed sense of patriotism. .Children in the market carry helium balloons with pictures of the young emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. His face is displayed on car stickers, mugs, T-shirts and skyscrapers across the bay. .At 84, Saad Al-Jassim remembers a time long before his nation was rich. A former pearl diver, also known for his feats as a strongman, he says Qatar must stand firm. .""We are now much, much better than before.

302,78,3 June 2018,The online war between Qatar and Saudi Arabia,".A year-long political conflict between the tiny, wealthy state of Qatar and its larger neighbours - including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - has been fought with a new arsenal of weapons: bots, fake news and hacking. .In the early hours of 24 May 2017, a news story appeared on the website of Qatar's official news agency, QNA, reporting that the country's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, had made an astonishing speech. .The quotes then appeared on the QNA's social media accounts and on the news ticker running along the bottom of the screen on videos uploaded to the agency's YouTube channel. .The emir was quoted praising Islamist groups Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood. And perhaps most controversially of all, Iran, Saudi Arabia's arch-rival. .But the story soon disappeared from the QNA website, and Qatar's foreign ministry issued a statement denying the speech had ever taken place. No video footage has ever emerged of the emir actually saying the words supposedly attributed to him. .Qatar claimed that the QNA had been hacked. And they said the hack was designed to deliberately spread fake news about the country's leader and its foreign policies. The Qataris specifically blamed UAE, an allegation later repeated by a Washington Post report which cited US intelligence sources. The UAE categorically denied those reports. .But the story of the emir's speech unleashed a media free-for-all. Within minutes, Saudi and UAE-owned TV networks - Al Arabiya and Sky News Arabia - picked up on the comments attributed to al-Thani. Both networks accused Qatar of funding extremist groups and of destabilising the region. .And soon after there was another alleged hacking - this time, targeted at the UAE. Youssef al-Otaiba, the UAE's ambassador to the US was hacked. His emails were leaked to the press. This led to long, lurid articles about his private life in international media. .On 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and their allies - nine governments in total - cut ties with Qatar. They expelled Qatari citizens, suspended diplomatic ties, closed Qatar's only land border, shut down their airspace and halted all trade. .The self-styled ""Anti-terror Quartet"", led by Saudi Arabia's new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, issued 13 wide-ranging demands for Qatar to meet in 10 days. These included closing down its main TV channel Al Jazeera and ceasing cooperation with Iran. .US President Donald Trump, fresh from his first presidential visit abroad - to Saudi Arabia - welcomed the move in a series of tweets the following day. He said it was evidence of his anti-terror policies in action. .So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding... ....extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! .His comments fuelled the propaganda battle that had already begun on Twitter. The platform was flooded with hashtags both for and against Qatar. .On the Qatar side, hashtags ""Tamim The Glorious"" and ""Qatar Is Not Alone"" appeared on Twitter's homepage in the Gulf, supposedly showing they were popular sentiments for the region's social media users. Meanwhile, The Saudi and UAE side accused Sheikh Tamim of being the ""Gaddafi of the Gulf"", a reference to the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. .However, a BBC Arabic investigation has revealed that the majority of tweets using these hashtags were pushed by fake accounts known as ""bots"". Bots are automated accounts which attempt to manipulate public opinion by artificially boosting the popularity of social media posts. .Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, took a deep dive into some of the most consistently trending hashtags in the conflict and establish the source of their popularity. .How to spot a bot .He detected Twitter bots using a number of methods, such as looking for sudden ""spikes"" in the traffic on a hashtag, which suggests automated posting. .""On #Tamim_The_Glorious, this post by an account @sabaqksa had 201 retweets in the space of a couple of seconds, that's not a normal pattern of behaviour,"" Nimmo says. The @sabaqksa account has been suspended by Twitter and BBC Arabic has not been able to contact its owner for comment. .Another massive surge of traffic on this hashtag came from one hundred accounts posting 1,410 times in a five hour period. Nimmo says it is ""utterly implausible"" that human operated accounts would post this frequently. .When a number of bot accounts work together like this, it is called a bot net. .But Nimmo found bots on the anti-Qatar side too, pushing out offensive tweets including images of Qatar's emir as a dog barking orders and another in which he is depicted as cross-eyed. .Many of the anti-Qatar bots seemed to be boosting tweets that were originally posted by one specific account, @saudq1978. .The @saudq1978 account belongs to Saud al-Qahtani, a prominent member of the Saudi Royal Court and advisor to Prince Mohammed bin Salman. With more than a million followers online, he has a significant presence on Twitter. .The top 5 tweets on the ""Gaddafi Of The Gulf"" hashtag were all from this account, which along with retweets made up 66% of the total traffic. The account accused Qatar of killing people in the Libyan civil war, and blamed it for funding terrorism and extremism. .BBC Arabic made repeated attempts to contact Saud al-Qahtani for comment, but without success. .Meanwhile, the ""boycott"" or ""blockade"" of Qatar - depending on which side you talk to - looks unlikely to be over soon, despite recent US efforts at mediation. .Hashtags about the conflict are still trending, and the hacking war has continued well into 2018. And the region's satellite TV channels are still trading accusations. .They have also presented very different pictures of the impact of the crisis on life in Qatar. Al Arabiya, which is owned by Saudi interests, has shown footage of supermarkets with empty shelves. But reports on Al-Jazeera, which is funded by the Qatari state, tend to show people on their streets living their lives as normal. .According to Dina Matar, a senior lecturer in Arab media and political communication at SOAS: ""It's not only a political battle, it's also a media battle. We have a huge problem in the Arab world just as you do in the West. Fake news is everywhere."" .""Arab politicians and leaders are completely aware that the media is important and that the media is an important weapon. It is a weapon for propaganda, a weapon for private and public interests,"" she says. .Recently, a hashtag which translates as #Anniversary_Of_The_Midnight_Fabrications trended in Qatar. It commemorates the first anniversary of the alleged hacking of the Qatar News Agency. Twelve months on from that original incident there is a little sign of the tensions abating between the two sides. .You may also be interested in: .More on this story .Do you have a story for us?

13 April 2018",Qatar 2022: World Cup in Gulf state could be 48-team tournament,".Fifa president Gianni Infantino wants to expand the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to 48 teams - which may mean matches being played in other Gulf states. .Football's world governing body voted last January to expand the tournament from 32 teams for 2026, but the South American confederation Conmebol have asked for that to be brought forward. .BBC Sport understands unofficial talks have taken place with Qatar officials, who remain sceptical given the logistical issues and practicalities of hosting an extra 16 teams. .Fifa will now conduct their own study to determine if the plan - which would involve Qatar hosting a further 16 matches - is feasible. .""It seems to me a very interesting idea,"" Infantino said after attending a Conmebol meeting in Buenos Aires. ""We have to study it seriously and if it is possible, why not? .""I firmly believe in an enlargement because I am convinced that it is good for the development of football. That is why we have proposed it and that is why we have agreed to it since 2026."" .Qatar are currently planning to build eight stadiums - four fewer than bidders for the 48-team 2026 edition have been told they will require. .The finals in four years' time have been scheduled to run across 28 days in November and December after the tournament was moved from its traditional summer slot because of concerns over heat. .Fifa has been very keen on this idea for a number of months, with discreet talks taking place with Qatar. Coincidentally, Infantino has been highly active in the region of late - meetings held with leaders in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for example. .There have also been reports of informal discussions about any potential expanded tournament involving Kuwait. It begs the question of whether Fifa's grand plan is to create a larger format tournament - one that Qatar cannot host alone due to its size. .A regional tournament would be politically difficult given the local tensions and the ongoing blockade Qatar is subject to. But the attraction for Fifa would be to be seen bringing countries together through football. .Qatar's regional neighbours would inevitably delight in seeing the country lose the prestige of hosting alone. For those reasons, you can expect Qatar to resist any such move. .",304

But it denied aiding jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS). .In return for ending the partial blockade, Qatar's neighbours demanded that it shut down the Al Jazeera news network, close a Turkish military base, cut ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, and downgrade relations with Iran. .Qatar rejected the demands, saying it would not agree to any measures that threatened its sovereignty. It quickly established new trade routes to ensure the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million were met and spent tens of billions of dollars to prop up its economy. .Despite Qatar hosting the largest US military facility in the Middle East, President Trump was quick to claim credit for the partial blockade. .But aides subsequently persuaded him to take a more neutral stance. Qatar also mounted an expensive lobbying campaign in Washington. .In a remarkable turnaround on Tuesday, Mr Trump hosted Sheikh Tamim at the Oval Office and praised Qatar's efforts to address US concerns. .""We're making sure that terrorism funding is stopped in the countries that we are really related to,"" he said. .""But those countries are stopping the funding of terrorism, and that includes UAE and it includes Saudi Arabia, it includes Qatar and others.

The unprecedented move was seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. .Qatari officials denied the claims in a statement to the BBC. .Its communications office said: ""Qatar would like to state unequivocally that it has not engaged in or committed any of the alleged accusations made falsely by Mr Broidy, nor has it engaged or paid anyone to do so. .""We believe that Mr Broidy's baseless accusations are simply a diversionary tactic to distract attention from the serious allegations against himself and his client the Government of the United Arab Emirates. .""The Government of Qatar reserves its right to taking any necessary legal action as the victim of false allegations by Mr Broidy or others."" .Mr Broidy's defence company Circinus has hundreds of millions of dollars worth of contracts with the UAE, according to the New York Times newspaper. .He had recently returned from the UAE when he met Mr Trump at the White House in October. .According to a memorandum he prepared of the meeting, Mr Broidy urged continued support of US allies the UAE and Saudi Arabia and advised Mr Trump against getting involved in last year's row with Qatar. .Mr Broidy called Qatar ""a television station with a country"" - alluding to broadcaster Al Jazeera - and said it was doing ""nothing positive"", according to the emails. .He said he touted a regional counter-terrorism force being set up by the UAE that his company was involved with, and suggested that the US president ""sit down"" with Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and a top UAE military commander. .""I offered that MBZ [the crown prince] is available to come to the US very soon and preferred a quiet meeting in New York or New Jersey.

324,15,4 October 2017,Exporting fresh liquid milk to the Middle East,".You don't export fresh milk. It doesn't make any sense. Received wisdom is it's too heavy and bulky and goes off too quickly. .Instead your only option is to take milk and then turn it into products that are much easier to send oversees like cheese, milk powder or butter. .Well I'm here to tell you received wisdom is completely wrong. To the tune of £5 for two litres of milk. .A little bit awkwardly, this was received wisdom I believed in. .I never thought I'd meet a Shropshire farmer sending his milk to supermarkets thousands of miles away. .And yet on a drizzly autumn day on Little Cloveley Farm near Whitchurch, that's just what happened. .There I was, standing talking to a farmer sending his milk to Qatar. And David Price was an extremely happy dairy farmer, as he says this new export trade is ""fantastic"". .So how on earth did this happen? Well, it's a mixture of top quality British milk, savvy exporters and Middle East politics. .David Price sends his milk to a dairy called Nemi, which is based in Cheshire. .Nemi bottle milk from farmers in Cheshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire and they pay very close attention to the diet their cows eat, aiming for milk that is rich in selenium and for which they can charge a premium. .Paying their farmers a good price for their milk. .Nemi are also a relatively small and pretty nimble operation which turns out to be important if you want to try doing what no one else has ever done before and export fresh liquid milk. .But none of this could have happened without some recent Middle East politics. .Saudi Arabia and its allies are currently blockading Qatar, a news story you can read more about here. .One of the effects of that embargo is no more fresh milk in Qatar because their daily pinta is mostly imported from giant Saudi Arabian dairy farms. .Enter Y International (UK) Ltd. An export company based in Birmingham that already sends British groceries out to a chain of Middle Eastern Hypermarkets called Lulu. .When the Saudi embargo began, boss Ricky Perks wondered if he and his team could fill this milk-sized gap that had just appeared in Qatari supermarket fridges. .So Ricky and Andrew Henderson of Nemi put their heads together to see if they could make exporting liquid milk work. .It is not an easy thing to do. There are all sorts of problems that need to be overcome. .First here's plenty of red tape that needs to be dealt with, from the relabeling of all the milk in Arabic to the demands of Qatari customs. .Then there are the physical problems of transporting the milk thousands of miles on an aeroplane. .The milk must be packed on a pallet with enough insulation to cope with the journey and even survive sitting on a hot runway after landing. .Here, a smaller dairy like Nemi has some inbuilt export advantages as they already have a fast moving supply chain producing really fresh milk that can survive the rigours of export. .From farm to Qatari supermarket takes around four days and when it arrives the fresh milk will have a seven-day shelf life. .Mind you, it also comes with a pretty hefty price tag. A standard two-litre bottle may cost around a pound here but by the time it gets into a Qatari shopping basket the consumer will be paying over a fiver for it. .Once on sale there's another advantage for a dairy like Nemi. .With their focus on the diet of the cows and the higher levels of selenium this is a very different bottle of milk to your standard ""loss leader"" supermarket poly bottle. .Nemi think of their milk as a premium product and that's how they market it in Qatar. .Their new labels for the export trade push that idea even further with the British flag and even Big Ben prominently featured. .Consumers in the Middle East associate this maximum Britishness with high quality and they will pay for it. .Finally there's the natural advantage of British milk that we tend to overlook in the UK basically it tastes good. .Especially compared to the local competition. .However impressive it is to produce milk in the desert of Saudi Arabia, the consumers of Qatar seem to prefer the taste of Shropshire milk from cows eating fresh green grass. .And that is how I came to be standing in a Shropshire field meeting some lovely lady cows who's milk would be on sale thousands of miles away in an air conditioned mall in a baking desert country. .So what's the long term business here? If the blockade ends could Saudi milk make a comeback? .Maybe, but in Birmingham, Y International and Nemi have plans. .If you can get milk to Qatar, why not India or even China? Millions of new consumers who could value fresh British milk and be prepared to pay a lot to get their hands on it. .Even if our milk only becomes a relatively niche product in China, that's still potentially huge amounts of milk for our farmers to export. .Right now this is a small export business finding its feet. But if this team can make it work then an real fresh milk export trade could revolutionise life for our dairy farmers.",324
325,16,4 October 2017,Modernising female voice for Qatar,".If the personal is political, then Sheikha Hind, a senior member of Qatar's ruling royal family, gives a very direct answer to her views on the end of the driving ban for women in Saudi Arabia. .""I have two asthmatic boys and when you need to take them in an emergency at 02:00 - and your husband is on a business trip... We're talking about safety."" .""It's a great decision,"" she says, as a parent as well as a driver, distancing herself from any suggestion that women should not have equal rights in such matters. .Sheikha Hind, 33, is the sister of the ruler of the wealthy state of Qatar - a country currently at the centre of a tense blockade and Middle Eastern power struggle. .If Qatar's neighbours want to isolate the country, Sheikha Hind is on a mission to reach out and present a distinctly modern, young and female face to the outside world. .""When the blockade happened we were all shocked. We didn't see it coming."" .And, speaking in London, she says she wants to counter perceptions of her country being an ""ultra-conservative"" Muslim state. .Her own background is determinedly international, having been a student at Duke University in the United States and at University College London in the UK. .This exposed her to some of the narrow views held by young Westerners about the Arab world. .""When I was in America, I got a comment that I thought you lived in tents,"" she says. .""What I'd like people to understand is that we're as normal as you are. .""We might have different traditions and cultures, but that doesn't make us very different. We all want highly educated citizens. We all want to have opportunities for every single person in our country."" .Education has been a big deal for Qatar - including pouring huge amounts into building a campus for eight international and two Qatari universities. .Sheikha Hind is now chief executive of the Qatar Foundation, the vehicle created almost 20 years ago for an epic-scale investment in education. .It has the hard-headed ambition of turning Qatar into a ""knowledge economy"" built on a well-educated workforce - ready for when the income from gas and oil runs out. .""In the end, we're a very small country. If we can make sure that the majority of our residents are educated so that they can be active citizens, then we'll be satisfied. We still have a long way to go, but we've started."" .But education is about asking difficult questions. For instance, can students discuss the merits of democracy over an autocracy? .""I'm sure they have those debates,"" she says. .""That's something we teach our students. You think for yourself, you listen to every side of an argument. We support that approach."" .""We have academic freedom in our campus and that encourages dialogue and any topic or issue,"" she says. .Although she adds that in defining ""democracy"", there is a wide ""spectrum"" of meanings. .In terms of women's access to education, she says that 65% of students in Qatar are women - and the current challenge is to recruit more men into higher education. .She is from a line of strong women - daughter of the Sheikha Moza, mother of the current ruler and often described as one of the most influential women in the Middle East. .Growing up in the centre of the country's ruling family, she says ""work and personal life are not really divided"". .She is part of the next generation of Qatar's royal family, redefining the next stage of the country's development. .This will mean investing even more in education - and finding better ways to motivate wealthy young people who have grown up without any hardship to spur them on. .Sheikha Hind says she is looking to develop different types of school to raise standards and to tackle the problem of motivation. .The blockade has so far not stopped one of Qatar's biggest below-the-radar exports - education to some of the world's poorest countries and out-of-school refugees. .Although Qatar has high profile ""soft power"" projects, not least hosting the World Cup, its extensive funding for education, including under the Education Above All banner, has often been curiously hidden away. .""It's a very cultural thing. It's also rooted in Islam. If you donate money, you don't put your name on it,"" she said. .""We're not very good at taking credit.

326,17,3 October 2017,Qatar Airways chief's faith in Cardiff Airport service,".The chief executive of Qatar Airways said he resisted pressure from inside the company not to fly between Doha and Cardiff Airport. .Akbar Al Baker said there were ""very strong arguments"" from people inside the airline that there were not enough passengers to justify the new daily flight. .But he insisted he will be proved right in opting for Cardiff instead of Bristol. .The route starts in May 2018. .Mr Al Baker told BBC Wales he would be the ""facilitator"" in bringing further investment into Wales using the new service. .The UK and Qatari governments have agreed a £5bn investment deal for future projects. .Qatar already has important links with Wales, including Qatar Petroleum which is the majority shareholder in South Hook, one of the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in Europe, in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire. .Cardiff Airport and the Welsh Government, which owns it, have made clear they are looking for a private sector partner to support the development of the Vale of Glamorgan site, including a new terminal building. .Mr Al Baker, speaking at a trade mission in the Qatari capital, said: ""Wales is a huge developing state - it was important that we operate and connect the people of Wales and the south west with the rest of the world."" .But he said the service would have to stand on its own two feet. .""We're not a taxi company, we're an airline, so we can't please and placate everyone's request,"" he said. .""We have to make sure where we operate, we're operating commercially and that we make sure the route is developing very fast and with the right kind of people and being the right kind of yield."" .Mr Al Baker said he had been lobbied by ministers, diplomats and airport bosses and there had been ""immense pressure"" to convince him to operate to Wales. .""We had competition between Wales and Bristol and Wales won."" .He said it was important to have daily flights and he had had arguments with his planning team over passenger numbers. .But he said Wales was ""a big part of the United Kingdom"" and there were travellers who could not be tapped directly from Cardiff before. .""When a child needs a bar of chocolate you don't give it in pieces - the region was longing for an international flight and as one of the world's only five star airlines, why shouldn't we go daily?"" .The announcement of the new route was made before the current dispute between Qatar and its neighbours including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. .Qatar Airways is banned from flying over those countries, which means flights could take longer and be more expensive, potentially deterring customers from Cardiff to Doha. .Mr Al Baker also rejected the idea the current strained relations in the Middle East would impact on UK travellers. .It is four years since Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh Government for £52m following a slump in passenger numbers. .Deb Barber, Cardiff Airport chief executive, said the Qatar Airways route was significantly important as it focused on turning around perceptions. .""It's about building what we call contagious confidence in the business both with passengers and airlines,"" she said. .""To have a world class airline like Qatar have confidence and trust in our airport and market will have a huge catalytic effect for us and add to the confidence we're building up on a monthly basis."" .She said there was a market of 1.4m passengers from the Wales and west region who at the moment flew to the Middle East from other airports. .A reception was held at the British embassy in Doha, with guests including Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and the RAF's Red Arrows display team. .Mr Cairns said: ""It's an opportunity for in-bound traffic but also outbound traffic so Cardiff becomes part of this global Britain that we're developing."" .Free trade call by Jones on US mission .'I've got to look Welsh farmers in the eye' .Qatar flights from Cardiff confirmed .Firms watching ahead of trade talks .Qatar Airways confident over new route .Cardiff Airport unveils Qatar flights .Qatar crisis: What's it about?",326

""The public prosecution will announce the outcome of the investigation as soon as it is over."" .There was no immediate comment from the Qatari authorities or from Sheikh Hamad, who stepped down as prime minister and foreign minister in 2013. .But Wefaq said the television report was an attempt by the Bahraini government to smear it and prolong the imprisonment of its leader, who has been jailed since 2015. .LuaLua TV cited a statement from the group explaining that Sheikh Hamad had spoken to Ali Salman as part of an attempt to resolve the political crisis in Bahrain that had ""the direct approval of the king"". .""The call was followed by a meeting between the Qatari official and the Bahraini king at his palace in al-Safraia,"" it added. .""Qatar was the sponsor of the American initiative presented by the US ambassador to Bahrain, Jeffrey Feltman, as part of mediation efforts between the government and the opposition, which refutes the regime's claims of Wefaq conspiring to overthrow the regime."" .Sunni-ruled Bahrain has been wracked by unrest since security forces crushed pro-democracy protests mainly led by the majority Shia community six years ago. .The king brought in troops from neighbouring Sunni-led Gulf states to end the demonstrations and restore order. The unrest left 30 civilians and five police dead. .Activists say dozens more people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces since then, while bomb attacks blamed on Shia militants allegedly backed by Iran have killed a number of policemen. .Ali Salman was jailed in 2015 after being convicted of inciting hatred, promoting disobedience and insulting public institutions, while Wefaq was dissolved last year for allegedly fomenting sectarian unrest. .Human rights activists said Ali Salman's trial was unfair and that the charges he faced violated his right to free expression.

But it is unlikely to provide a permanent solution. .The problem comes down to how countries choose to interpret ""extremism and terrorism"". Qatar has long prided itself on giving voice to alternative views to the edited, government-approved ones aired by its conservative neighbours. Hence one of the reasons why Qatar's Al Jazeera network has been such a thorn in their sides. .However, the charge levelled against Qatar is that those alternative voices include people committed to the overthrow of governments in the region. .Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood, which it considers a peaceful, political force. But Qatar's opponents in the region consider the Brotherhood to be a terrorist organisation that is an existential threat to their rule. These differences have yet to be resolved. .They were combating terrorism and extremism, denying financing and safe havens to terrorist groups, stopping incitement to hatred and violence, and refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, according to the New York Times. .Mr Mouallimi stressed that there would be ""no compromise"" on the principles, but added that both sides would be able to discuss how to implement them. .The list of 13 demands handed to Qatar on 22 June included shutting down the Al Jazeera news network, closing a Turkish military base, cutting ties with the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading relations with Iran. .Mr Mouallimi said closing Al Jazeera might not be necessary but stopping incitement to violence and hate speech was essential. .Giles Trendle of Al Jazeera speaking in June: ""We're not partisan to any particular group or ideology"" .""If the only way to achieve that is by closing down Al Jazeera, fine,"" he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. ""If we can achieve that without closing down Al Jazeera, that's also fine. The important thing is the objective and the principle involved."" .UAE permanent representative Lana Nusseibeh warned that if Qatar was ""unwilling to accept core principles around what defines terrorism or extremism in our region, it will be very difficult"" for it to remain in the Gulf Co-operation Council. .Qatar has acknowledged providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. But it has denied aiding jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS). .UAE Minister of State for International Co-operation Reem al-Hashimi said: ""At this stage, the ball is in Qatar's court."" .She added that the US had ""a very constructive and very important role to play in hopefully creating a peaceful resolution to this current crisis"". .US President Donald Trump was quick to claim credit for the pressure being placed on Qatar, saying it might mark the ""beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". .But his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, questioned the list of demands, acknowledging that some elements would ""be very difficult for Qatar to meet"". .Also on Tuesday, NBC News cited US intelligence officials as disputing a report that alleged Qatar had paid a ransom of $1bn (£770m) to Iraqi Shia Muslim militias, Iranian security officials and Sunni Muslim jihadists in Syria as part of a deal to secure the release of royal family members kidnapped in Iraq. .The officials said Qatar had handed €300m ($345m) in cash to Iraq's government but that Baghdad had confiscated the money after securing the hostages' release. .Air-lifted dairy cows arrive in Qatar .Qatar crisis: What you need to know .'We're doing this to help Qatar' .Have Saudis gone too far?",340
341,32,19 July 2017,Qatar crisis: What you need to know,".The tiny oil- and gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar has been cut off by some of its powerful Arab neighbours over its alleged support for terrorism. .Qatar refused to comply with an initial list of 13 demands, saying it would not agree to any measures that threatened its sovereignty or violated international law. .The emirate has now been told by its neighbours that they want it to accept six broad principles on combating extremism and terrorism. .Qatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to its neighbours but there are two key issues which have angered them in recent years. .One is Qatar's support for Islamist groups. Qatar acknowledges that it has provided assistance to some, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, but denies aiding militant groups linked to al-Qaeda or so-called Islamic State (IS). .The other key issue is Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. The Shia Muslim power is Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. .The deep diplomatic tensions behind the Qatar row .All you need to know about Qatar .Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar on 5 June. They also gave Qatari citizens 14 days to leave their territory and banned their own citizens from travelling to or residing in Qatar. .Egypt also cut diplomatic ties but did not impose restrictions on its 180,000 citizens living in Qatar. .Yemen, the Maldives and Libya's eastern-based government later followed suit. .In addition, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt closed their airspace to Qatari aircraft, and said foreign airlines would have to seek permission for overflights to and from Qatar. .Qatar's only land border was also closed by Saudi Arabia and ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports. .Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait has offered to mediate in the dispute. .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Qatar travel: What does it mean for me? .Qatar is dependent on imports by land and sea for the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million, and about 40% of its food came in through the land border with Saudi Arabia. .Initially, supermarket shelves in Doha were emptied of basic supplies as residents rushed to stock up but the hoarding quickly ended after Turkey and Iran began sending food by air and sea. .The economic disruption could have an impact on Qatar if the dispute drags on. .Doha's Hamad International Airport has been far quieter than usual. Qatar Airways, the national carrier, has had to cancel flights to 18 regional cities and to reroute those to other destinations because of the airspace restrictions. .Qatar's stock market lost about 10%, or about $15bn (£12bn), in market value over the first four weeks of the crisis. However, the stock market has since recovered 6% of its pre-crisis value. Exports of liquefied natural gas have also so far not been affected and the emirate's finance minister says Qatar has enough resources to defend its economy and currency. .Companies working on new stadiums and infrastructure projects for the 2022 football World Cup have meanwhile had to secure new sources for building materials. .Shipping costs have gone up tenfold but Qatar has begun shipping cargo through Oman to get around the restrictions on access to ports in the UAE. .Qatar 'facing indefinite isolation' .Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar? .Qatar's neighbours said on 5 July they had received a ""negative response"" to the 13-point list of demands presented to Qatar on 22 June.

That was something it would ""never do"", he stressed. .""Qatar continues to call for dialogue, despite the violation of international laws and regulations, despite the separation of 12,000 families, despite the siege that is a clear aggression and an insult to all international treaties, bodies and jurisdictions,"" Sheikh Mohammed added. .Qatar FM: 'There is no evidence' .Qatar has provided assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood and the Hamas movement. .And while Qatar is a member of the US-led coalition against IS, it has faced accusations from Iraqi Shia leaders that it provided financial support to jihadists. .Qatar - and Saudi Arabia for that matter - has also provided money and weapons to hardline Islamist rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria. But it has stressed that it does not have links to the al-Qaeda-linked alliance, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. .Qatar's neighbours also seized on a report alleging it had paid a ransom of $1bn (£770m) to Iraqi Shia militias, Iranian security officials and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as part of a deal to secure the release of royal family members kidnapped in Iraq. .On 18 July, NBC News cited US intelligence officials as saying that €300m ($345m; £265m) had instead been paid to the Iraqi government, which had been in contact with the hostage-takers and subsequently confiscated the cash.

However, the remarks were reported across the region and caused a stir. .The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt responded by blocking Qatari media. .Two weeks later, the four countries cut all links with Qatar over its alleged support for terrorism and relations with Iran. The boycott has caused turmoil in the oil- and gas-rich emirate, which is dependent on imports by land and sea for the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million. .The US intelligence officials told the Washington Post it was unclear whether the UAE authorities had hacked the Qatar News Agency itself or paid a third party to do it. .The Qatari government communication office said in a statement: ""The information published in the Washington Post... revealed the involvement of the United Arab Emirates and senior Emirati officials in the hacking of Qatar News Agency."" .The Guardian reported last month that an investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had concluded that freelance Russian hackers were responsible. .US intelligence agencies declined to comment on the Post's article, but the UAE's ambassador insisted that it ""had no role whatsoever in the alleged hacking"". .""What is true is Qatar's behaviour. Funding, supporting, and enabling extremists from the Taliban to Hamas and Gaddafi. Inciting violence, encouraging radicalization, and undermining the stability of its neighbours,"" Yousef al-Otaiba wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. .Qatar has acknowledged providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. But it has denied aiding jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda or so-called Islamic State (IS). .Mr Gargash told the BBC that Qatar's denial had been contradicted by its agreement to review a list of 59 individuals and 12 organisations who the UAE has accused of supporting terrorism and wants arrested or expelled. .""What we know now is that Qatar is admitting that the list is worthy, that the list needs to be looked at, and that they need to change some of their laws to ensure that there is a proper process to cover this list,"" he said. .Mr Gargash said Qatar's neighbours were prepared to continue the boycott for months if it did not comply with the list of demands it was handed last month and agree to international monitoring. .""I understand the concern of our allies,"" he added. ""But the issue is that we are being hurt, and the world is being hurt, by a state that has $300bn (£230bn) and is the main sponsor of this jihadist agenda."" .But, he added, the four states would not escalate the boycott by asking companies to choose between doing business with them or with Qatar. .Air-lifted dairy cows arrive in Qatar .Qatar crisis: What you need to know .'We're doing this to help Qatar' .Have Saudis gone too far?",342

What matters is effective safety and security training, along with experience on the job."" .The vice-president of flight service for American Airlines, Jill Surdek, also said in a message to employees that Mr Al Baker's remarks were ""incredibly offensive"". .The controversy comes amid a row between US carriers and Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airline over alleged state support for them. .On Wednesday, American Airlines announced that it was cancelling a code-share agreement with Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways as ""an extension of our stance against the illegal subsidies"". The airlines deny receiving state subsidies. .Mr Al Baker said he was disappointed with the decision on Thursday, but that he would proceed with plans to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines. .""Our stock purchase request and filing is going ahead as normal.

It has said the demands break international law. .The initial deadline for Qatar to agree to the group's 13 demands expired on Sunday. .Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani was in Kuwait on Monday to hand over a formal response in the form of a letter from the emir of Qatar to the emir of Kuwait, the main mediator in the Gulf crisis. .In a statement released shortly beforehand, lawyers for Qatar denounced the demands and called for international condemnation. .They said the tactics were ""reminiscent of the extreme and punitive conduct of 'bully' states that have historically resulted in war. .""The world must unite immediately to halt the singling out of Qatar for unjustified collective punishment and humiliation and to preserve peace, security and prosperity in the region."" .Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for weeks from Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain. .The four countries, whose foreign ministers will meet on Wednesday to discuss the situation, have accused Qatar of harbouring Islamist groups that they consider terrorist organisations - including the Muslim Brotherhood - and giving them a platform on the Al Jazeera satellite channel, which is funded by the Qatari state. Doha denies the accusations. .The imposed restrictions have caused turmoil in Qatar, an oil- and gas-rich nation dependent on imports to meet the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million. As a result, Iran and Turkey have been increasingly supplying it with food and other goods. .Al Jazeera journalists ""demand press freedom"" .UAE officials have told the BBC that after the new deadline expires on Tuesday, the offer for Qatar to return to the Arab fold will be off the table, the economic and political sanctions on it will become permanent and Qatar will be ostracised by its closest Arab neighbours. .The situation is the worst political crisis among Gulf countries in decades. .According to the Associated Press news agency, which obtained a copy of the list, Qatar must also: .An unnamed official from one of the four countries told Reuters news agency that Qatar was also being asked to sever links with so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah. .The demands have not been officially unveiled.

355,46,3 July 2017,"Qatar crisis: After the deadline, what next?",".The latest deadline set by Gulf Arab states for Qatar to submit to a humiliating list of 13 demands is due to expire at midnight on Tuesday. .Qatar has already submitted its response to Kuwaiti mediators and its foreign minister has said the demands were so unrealistic they were ""meant to be rejected"". .UAE officials have told the BBC that after the deadline expires the offer for Qatar to return to the Arab fold will be off the table, the economic and political sanctions on it will become permanent and Qatar will be ostracised by its closest Arab neighbours. .The West should worry about this latest crisis in the Middle East for two reasons. .First, Qatar is a key ally in the on-going fight against so-called Islamic State (IS). Qatar hosts al-Udaid, the largest US airbase in the Middle East. .Secondly, Qatar has an estimated $335bn (£254bn) strategically invested globally, with billions pumped into the UK and US economies. If the West is forced to choose between Qatar and its opponents then those investments could, theoretically, be at risk. .It is about terrorism or it is about foreign policy, depending on which side you listen to. .Qatar stands accused of supporting terrorism and extremism by a triumvirate of Gulf Arab states - Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain - backed by Egypt and others. .They say that for 20 years now, Qatar has been destabilising the region by supporting Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda and IS. They say Qatar promised in 2014 to stop supporting such groups yet it has continued regardless. .They also accuse Qatar of paying more than $1bn in ransom money to Iranian-backed Shia militia groups to secure the release of a royal hunting party who got kidnapped in Iraq while hunting wildfowl. .Qatar denies all charges of supporting terrorism, as well as paying ransoms to terrorist groups. The Qataris say this row has nothing to do with terrorism, and that this is really about its powerful neighbours trying to force Qatar's foreign policy into line with Saudi Arabia's. Qatar's Foreign Minister calls it an attack on his country's sovereignty. .The 13 demands include closing down Qatar's controversial satellite TV network, Al Jazeera, which has long been a thorn in the side of its conservative neighbours. Another demand is the closing of a Turkish military base, recently reinforced by a contingent of troops and armoured vehicles. .And a further demand is the scaling back of diplomatic ties with Iran, with whom Qatar shares the largest offshore natural gas field. .The list of demands was prompted by US frustration that the Arab bloc had failed to state clearly what they expected of Qatar in this dispute. The US, which is trying to mediate the dispute, asked for the demands to be ""reasonable and actionable"". .Yes it does, but so too does Saudi Arabia. .For years now, Qatar has had close links with political Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas in Gaza and Islamist factions in Libya and Syria. Al Jazeera stands accused of airing the views of extremist preachers who support acts most people would consider as terrorism. .Giles Trendle of Al Jazeera speaking in June: ""We're not partisan to any particular group or ideology"" .The conservative, tribal monarchies that surround Qatar - the al-Saud in Saudi Arabia, the al-Nahyans in Abu Dhabi and the al-Khalifa in Bahrain - all view these Islamist groups as a threat to their rule and in some cases they accuse the Muslim Brotherhood of being synonymous with terrorism. .So has Qatar actually funded terrorism? Absolutely not, say Qatari officials who came to London last week. Yet when I met the head of Qatari Intelligence in 2014, he told me they had been able to secure the release of several hostages in Syria from the proscribed terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra, backed at the time by al-Qaeda. Kidnappers do not willingly release their hostages without getting something in return. .Qatar's accusers have published a detailed list of 59 named individuals they say are all proven terrorism supporters and who are at large in Qatar. One is even a member of the extended ruling family. .Qatar says the list is a politically-motivated fabrication and that anyone on its soil suspected of terrorism is either prosecuted or placed under 24-hour surveillance. .For many, the notion of Saudi Arabia accusing another country of supporting Islamic extremism is a strange one. Fifteen of the 19 suicide hijackers in the 9/11 attacks of 2001 were Saudis (not one was Qatari). More than 4,000 Saudis have gone to join IS, although the Saudi authorities did belatedly try to stop them. .More importantly, there is a commonality of extremist views and practices that are shared by IS and thousands of religious conservatives in Saudi Arabia, known as Wahhabis. These centre around the notion of takfir, meaning declaring another Muslim to be an ""apostate"" if they don't adhere to your ultra-strict version of Islam. .To many takfiris, all the world's 150-200m Shia Muslims are heretics. Churches and all non-Muslim acts of worship are banned in Saudi Arabia. The beheading of prisoners is a practice shared by the Saudi state and IS. .There are many in Saudi Arabia who would like to see the country move away from its strict interpretation of Islam and the new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has already curtailed the powers of the religious police. .But Saudi Arabia's funding of mosques, schools and textbooks around the world continues to bring accusations that it is supporting extremism. .Not directly, but Qatar has called on its allies including Britain to help lift what it calls the blockade placed on it by the Arab bloc. There have been discussions about setting up a pan-Gulf monitoring system to check if any country is secretly funding terrorism or extremism. Qatar and the UAE have both said they would submit to this but Saudi Arabia's position is less clear. .For the UK, perhaps the most dangerous escalation of the crisis would be if the Arab bloc were to force countries to choose between doing business with Qatar or with them (also worth billions of pounds in Britain's case). .Qatar owns Harrods, 95% of the Shard building, 22% of the London Stock Exchange, nearly 6% of Barclays plc and 50% of Canary Wharf. In a post-Brexit world especially, these are not investments Britain could afford to divest. .Unlikely but it is just possible. .The UAE government spokesman has told me his country has no plans to ""militarise"" the row and certainly any outbreak of armed conflict would be disastrous for all sides. .Qatar has a longstanding military agreement with Turkey and hosts a Turkish base as well as a US one. The Qatari Ambassador to Moscow, Fahad al-Attiyah, told me last week he believed the presence of reinforced Turkish troops in Qatar had helped to deter an invasion. .All the countries involved in this row have spent staggering sums of money on sophisticated western weaponry, none of which was ever intended to be turned on one of their own. The US plans to sell $12bn of F15 warplanes to Qatar but this is being blocked by Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who wants a block on all arms sales to America's Gulf Arab allies until this dispute is resolved. .Turkey's government is backing Qatar, flying in troops and materiel to help it survive the severing of air links with Gulf Arab neighbours. .Turkey and Qatar both support political Islam and last week a high-level Qatari delegation was in Ankara meeting the Turkish defence minister to discuss future cooperation as well as joint manoeuvres. An added complication here is that Turkey, already embroiled in the Syrian civil war, is a Nato member. .Iran is a maritime neighbour of Qatar's and they share the vast North Dome gas field beneath the waters of the Gulf. Since Qatar has to import much of its food supplies and the land border with Saudi Arabia is now closed, Iran has been flying in regular plane loads of food, something the Qataris have compared to the Berlin Airlift of 1948. .Qatar insists it has every right to maintain good relations with Tehran, pointing out that Oman, another Gulf Arab neighbour does the same without criticism. In the long term, if this crisis is not resolved, expect to see a strengthening of Qatar-Iran ties. .So far, mediation efforts by both Kuwait and the US have been unable to bridge the very wide gap between the two sides. The Saudis say their demands are non-negotiable, the Emiratis say there is zero trust with the Qataris and Qatar says it will not negotiate while it is ""under siege with an illegal blockade"". .The foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt are due to meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss and co-ordinate their next move. .Even if some face-saving formula is found to at least partially lift the current sanctions and patch up differences on the surface, the wounds from this row go too deep now. The GCC, the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council founded in 1981, is effectively broken and is unlikely to be able to be stitched back together as a functioning, unified entity in its present form. .In practice, barring an unlikely complete capitulation by Qatar, down the line this means we are likely to see the Gulf Arab states split into three undeclared blocs. The hard core will be Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain, the three countries most critical of Qatar's behaviour. Qatar, unless it capitulates to their demands, will be largely on its own but supported by non-Arab Iran and Turkey. Neutral and on the sidelines will be Oman and Kuwait who simply wish to maintain good relations with all sides and for whom this row is deeply unwelcome. .The only beneficiaries of this future Gulf Arab fragmentation will be Iran, the arch rival of Saudi Arabia, and IS - always ready and willing to exploit any weakness amongst its enemies. .Many UK banks stop sale of Qatari riyals .Qatar 'facing indefinite isolation' .Mideast arms sales: What's America's strategy? .Qatar row: Baby names and luxury brands",355
356,47,30 June 2017,Trumplomacy: Qatar is Tillerson's big test," .Rex Tillerson is facing his biggest test as secretary of state over the crisis involving the tiny nation of Qatar. .He's not only trying to mediate a solution to a visceral feud among America's Gulf Arab allies which threatens US national security interests. He has also been undermined by President Trump, who has publicly taken a side in the dispute and may even have helped to trigger it. .At issue are the accusations - levelled by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt - that Doha supports terrorists. They've cut diplomatic and travel ties and issued a sweeping set of demands that Qatar claims are so ""unrealistic"" they're really aimed at forcing it to ""surrender its sovereignty"". .Mr Trump has delegated the mess to Mr Tillerson, but that didn't stop the president from castigating Qatar at a White House press conference for having funded terrorism ""at a very high level"". .He made the remark shortly after a visit to Saudi Arabia that so fulsomely embraced Riyadh some regional observers believe it emboldened the kingdom to take radical action on long-standing grievances against Doha. .""We felt that we had Trump by our side,"" mused a Saudi security expert, ""so let's finish this little country that's been bugging us for years."" .Qatar has been ""bugging"" its neighbours with its maverick foreign policy. .They accuse it of harbouring their opponents and giving them a platform on its Al Jazeera satellite channel, especially political Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which is viewed as a particular threat by the absolute monarchies. .The White House has called the tempest a ""family issue"", but it's not happening in a teapot; with US Mideast military assets spread out among the Gulf States, it can't avoid getting drawn in. .America's al-Udeid air base in Qatar is not only the headquarters for the air war against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, but important for its ability to project power into the Indian Ocean. .And the feud has thrown a spanner into the works of US Mideast policy, shattering a unified Arab front aimed at countering terrorism and confronting Iran. .""This is not a local regional thing,"" says Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute. ""This is not a game."" .This week Washington was crowded with Gulf foreign ministers making their case, and Mr Tillerson's been in the eye of the storm. .His intensive engagement has the backing of the White House, an administration official insisted. .""What gets the attention are the tweets and public statements,"" he said, but on the underlying policy, the ""White House and State Department are on the same page."" .At times, though, it has seemed as if they weren't even reading the same book. .Mr Tillerson was reportedly blind-sided and infuriated by President Trump's Rose Garden denunciation of Qatar, delivered just hours after the secretary of state had called for an end to the blockade. .His aides were apparently convinced that the true author of Mr Trump's statement was the UAE ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba, a close friend of Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Mark Perry of the American Conservative. .Qatari communications, on the other hand, have been channelled entirely through the Department of State, says the Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, barring some initial phone calls from White House officials. .Mr Tillerson has levied some sharp words at Qatar's Gulf detractors, suggesting that political disputes were driving their accusations of terrorism, and declaring that some of their demands would be difficult for Qatar to meet. .His approach, though, has been that of a facilitator, focused on helping the Qataris prepare their response to the list of demands. He hopes this can serve as the basis for negotiations, even though the Saudis have said there is nothing to negotiate. .""Zero tolerance"" the foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir has declared. .But it is unclear how far the administration is willing to use its considerable leverage to even get everyone around the table, let alone muscle all sides into a resolution. .It's up to Mr Tillerson to make the case for a way forward. But the former oil executive has yet to find a way to turn his business acumen into political nous, translating his apparently strong relationship with the president into a strong policy-making role. .And the public disconnect with the White House has weakened his hand. .""I think he has less authority to speak in the name of the US government than other secretaries of state have had in the past,"" says Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. .""It's a very dangerous position for a secretary of state to be in when you can't confidently speak in the name of the president."" .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Mideast arms sales: What's America's strategy? .Trump's 'climate Brexit' blow to Tillerson .Five key things we learned from US air strike",356
357,48,29 June 2017,Qatar row: Daughter named Saudia and Harrods boycott call,".The diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and Qatar is being played out on social media this week. Ordinary civilians have taken to Twitter to express their solidarity or voice their frustrations. .Parents in the Middle East are demonstrating their patriotism during the ongoing rift by naming their children after the country they support. .A Saudi national has named his new baby girl 'Al-Saudia' following a Kuwaiti father who last week announced that his daughter would be known as 'Qatar.' .The pledge of allegiance by Qatar's father inspired Ahmed al-Anizi to post a video on Twitter holding his newborn daughter wrapped in a Saudi flag, announcing: ""In response to the Kuwaiti citizen who named his daughter Qatar, I am a Saudi citizen and I am naming the first baby that God has blessed me with al-Saudia"" .Arab Twitter - a large but loose collection of people tweeting in Arabic, mostly living in Gulf countries - has responded to the latest baby naming with the hashtag #Saudi_names_his_daughter_Saudia, which has been tweeted more than 65,000 times since it was posted on the 27 June. .The pledges of allegiance follow a rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and several other Arab states. They accuse Doha of supporting terrorism. .Kuwait, which is not one of the countries boycotting Doha, has been mediating in an attempt to heal the rift. .But there's been mixed reaction to the fathers' pledges of solidarity. Some applauded the move while others questioned why children were being brought into the political spat between the gulf countries, .One Twitter user posted: ""Today I feel proud of the awareness of this nation's youth of the dangers of our enemies, who work day and night to shatter our unity."" .Another commented: ""I wish I could have been named Saudia because this would be an honour for me. Yes, I am a Saudi and proud of it and hopefully if I get married, I'll name my first-born Saudia."" .You might also like: .Others were less impressed at the expression of loyalty: ""This is not nationalism, just like the person who named his daughter Qatar,"" posted another Twitter user. ""This is pretentiousness mixed with defiance, and without consideration for the fact that the child has become a commodity in this situation."" .Another Twitter user agreed: ""No matter how patriotic you are, it shouldn't reach the point of calling your daughter a name that might cause her issues when she grows up. Call her a nice name and express your patriotism some other way."" .Baby naming is not the only way civilians in the gulf are becoming involved in the diplomatic row. .Qatari online users have today reacted sarcastically to a call by an Emirati official to boycott the UK's famous department store Harrods, which is owned by the Qatari royal family. .The Arabic hashtag ""Boycott Qatari Harrods"" is a top trend in Qatar, attracting approximately 20,000 tweets in 24 hours. Users criticised the campaign and downplayed its impact on Qatari investments. .The critical comments came in response to a tweet on 26 June by Sultan Ali Rashid, Chairman of the Emirati-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce in Oslo, who said: ""Every dirham spent in Harrods means participation in spilling blood of innocent people. Do not support the state of terrorism. Join us in the boycott of Qatari Harrods."" .One Twitter user described the call as ""childish"" while another mocked the boycott as unnecessary if Harrods has a no-dogs-allowed policy. .One Twitter user in Doha questioned whether it would have any impact on the famous store: ""Harrods is one of the biggest icons of London. You think one or two countries boycotting would affect its profit?"" .Others joked Harrods shouldn't be the only place to be singled out, given other places and brands were Qatari-owned. .As this Qatari twitter user pointed out: ""By the way, Qatar owns a percentage of Heathrow Airport. So, do not come to London."" .By the UGC and Social News team; Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring's Sumaya Bakhsh and Zakariya Ayyad .You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.

358,49,28 June 2017,Qatar condemns Saudi refusal to negotiate over demands,".Qatar's foreign minister has condemned its Gulf neighbours for refusing to negotiate over their demands for restoring air, sea and land links. .Sheikh Mohammed al-Thani said the stance was ""contrary to the principles"" of international relations. .Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt accuse Qatar of aiding terrorism - a charge it denies. .It has been presented with a list of demands that the Saudi foreign minister on Tuesday called ""non-negotiable"". .The restrictions have caused turmoil in Qatar, an oil- and gas-rich nation that is dependent on imports to meet the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million. .On Friday, Qatar was given 10 days to comply with a 13-point list of demands to end the crisis that included shutting down the Al Jazeera news network, closing a Turkish military base, cutting ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, and curbing diplomatic relations with Iran. .US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought to resolve the crisis, acknowledged that some elements would ""be very difficult for Qatar to meet"", but that there were ""significant areas which provide a basis for ongoing dialogue"". .But after holding talks with Mr Tillerson in Washington on Tuesday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir was asked by journalists if the demands were non-negotiable. He replied: ""Yes."" .""It's very simple. We made our point. We took our steps and it's up to the Qataris to amend their behaviour. Once they do, things will be worked out. But if they don't, they will remain isolated,"" he said. .""If Qatar wants to come back into the [Gulf Co-operation Council] pool, they know what they have to do."" .Mr Jubeir stressed that the decision to sever ties with Qatar was made after taking into account the history of its behaviour, which he alleged included harbouring known terrorists and funding extremist groups throughout the region. .Qatar's foreign minister, who met Mr Tillerson at the state department later on Tuesday, called the Saudi position ""unacceptable"". .""This is contrary to the principles that govern international relations because you can't just present lists of demands and refuse to negotiate,"" Sheikh Mohammed was quoted as saying in a ministry statement. .Sheikh Mohammed said the US agreed the demands had to be ""reasonable and actionable"", and that the allegations against Qatar also needed to be discussed. .""We agree that the State of Qatar will engage in a constructive dialogue with the parties concerned if they want to reach a solution and overcome this crisis."" .The UAE ambassador to Russia told the Guardian newspaper on Wednesday that the Gulf Arab states were considering fresh economic sanctions on Qatar. .""One possibility would be to impose conditions on our own trading partners and say you want to work with us then you have got to make a commercial choice,"" Omar Ghobash said. .Meanwhile, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kay said the closure of Al Jazeera would ""strike a major blow against media pluralism in a region already suffering from severe restrictions on reporting and media of all kinds"". .Qatar 'facing indefinite isolation' .Qatar crisis deepens as Gulf sides stand their ground .Qatar crisis: Have Saudis gone too far? .Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Arab demands on Qatar difficult - US .Al Jazeera director denies accusations",358
359,50,27 June 2017,"Qatar facing indefinite isolation, UAE says",".With less than a week remaining for Qatar to comply with a tough set of 13 demands from its Gulf Arab neighbours, it is looking increasingly likely that this month's economic and political sanctions imposed on Qatar will become permanent. .Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have demanded, inter alia, that Qatar stop funding terrorism - which it denies - downgrade ties with Iran and close down its Al Jazeera broadcaster, or face permanent isolation. .Qatar is not backing down. .""Qatar is not responding positively to what we've sent,"" says UAE government spokesman Omar Ghobash, who, as well as being the country's ambassador to Moscow, is also the author of a counter-extremism book, Letters to a Young Muslim. .""I think the whole idea would be to ultimately, simply disengage from Qatar."" .Including, I ask him, expelling Qatar from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)? Not immediately, he says, but that is certainly under discussion. .Is there a risk this could escalate into a military conflict? .""Not from our side,"" says Mr Ghobash. ""These are relatives and friends. They have a leadership that's decided to undermine us. We'll cut all our ties with Qatar, economic, political and even social as a result of the flight bans."" .The deadline imposed on Qatar to comply runs out on Monday, 3 July. What exactly will change then, I asked Mr Ghobash. .""The difference would be that we'd no longer be interested in bringing Qatar back into the Gulf and the Arab fold,"" he says. .So if Qatar is going to be effectively declared a pariah state by its most powerful Gulf Arab neighbours, then is there not a risk for them that this will drive Qatar into the arms of Saudi Arabia's arch rival, Iran? .""Unfortunately Qatar has been in the arms of Iran and many Sunni extremist groups for a long time,"" says Mr Ghobash. ""So the idea of it falling into Iran's lap is something we accept [as a risk] but at least it will provide clarity to the region and we'll know who our friends and enemies are. .Iran and Turkey both share Qatar's backing for political Islam and they have both rushed to help the beleaguered Gulf state. .Turkey already has a military base there, which the Arab coalition has demanded be closed. Instead, Turkey has airlifted in armoured vehicles, which have been rolling through the capital Doha at the weekend, and has hinted it may reinforce its contingent with hundreds more troops. .This has prompted Bahrain to accuse Qatar of ""military escalation"". .Around the Gulf there is a degree of irritation that this spat between neighbours has ballooned into such a public and embarrassing quarrel, one which will ultimately damage the whole region's economies. I put it to Mr Ghobash that some people in the West might see this crisis as a needless squabble between dynastic monarchies. .""I would say that is a complete misrepresentation of the situation,"" he responds. ""This is not a squabble between monarchs, this is a serious conflict and a turning point in our societies… This is a principled stand that we are taking against very powerful negative narratives of Islam being funded by countries like Qatar."" .For now, neutral Kuwait is trying to mediate, so far without success. But ultimately everyone knows it will be the US that has to broker a solution. .The Pentagon has more than 11,000 servicemen and women stationed in Qatar, at Central Command's forward base at Al-Udaid airbase, from which it directs most of its air operations throughout the Middle East. .Qatar is an ally of both the US and Britain, and Washington has agreed to sell Qatar $12bn (£9.4bn) worth of sophisticated F15 warplanes. .Every day that this crisis drags on adds more uncertainty to the future direction of the US-led military campaign against so-called Islamic State. .Qatar crisis: Have Saudis gone too far? .Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Arab demands on Qatar difficult - US .Al Jazeera director denies accusations",359

The sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others two weeks ago had failed to produce the result they wanted. Qatar has remained defiant, rejecting their accusations and pulling in help from Iran and Turkey. .The list of demands now being made are humiliating for Qatar - closing its flagship TV channel Al Jazeera, for example, would spell an end to a 21-year drive to put Qatar firmly on the global media map. .Some Gulf commentators believe these demands may be just a starting point for negotiations but the Saudi and UAE governments are in no mood for compromise. They don't trust Qatar's word. .So if there really is no room for manoeuvre on the demands that would leave only two courses: total capitulation by Qatar and its return to the Gulf Arab fold, as a meek and much reduced national figure; or a defiant Qatar expelled from the GCC and quite possibly becoming a dependent ally of Iran's. .Qatar's critics may yet regret what they have started. .Five surprising facts about Qatar .According to the Associated Press news agency, which obtained a copy of the list, Qatar must also: .An unnamed official from one of the four countries told Reuters news agency that Qatar was also being asked to sever links with so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah. .According to the document seen by AP, Qatar is being asked to shut down diplomatic posts in Iran, expel any members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard and only conduct trade with Iran that complies with US sanctions. .The demands have not been officially unveiled.

367,58,22 June 2017,Qatar crisis deepens as Gulf sides stand their ground,".Three weeks in to the worst Gulf crisis in decades, questions are still being asked about why unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions were imposed on the state of Qatar by its powerful neighbours. .Now even Washington is expressing doubt. .""We hope the list of demands will soon be presented to Qatar and will be reasonable and actionable,"" was the diplomatically phrased message of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. .His polite nudging came a day after an unusually blunt statement from Washington over a delay in providing details that had ""mystified"" state department officials. .""At this point, we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar's alleged support for terrorism, or were they about the long simmering grievances?""a spokeswoman asked. .That rebuke stood in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump's fulsome support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, backed by neighbouring Bahrain and Egypt, when they first took actions that included closing Qatar's only land border and limiting its airspace. .An answer to the state department's question is said to be on the way. .Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told us on Friday that a list of ""grievances"" would be presented to Qatar ""fairly soon"", addressing its alleged support for terrorism and extremist groups destabilising the region. .Mr Jubeir and UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash, who have been shuttling between capitals, also said a monitoring and verification system aimed at stopping flows of money and other support was in the works. One source said details of a new mechanism should be ready within a week. .But Qatar is already rebuffing what is expected to be the next salvo. .""Those who oppose Qatar's political stances always use 'terrorism' as a pretext,"" was the response of a senior Qatari diplomat in Doha, who told me by email they were still receiving ""mixed messages"". .He said ""no demands had been put forward"" and dismissed new moves as ""the latest chapter in a concerted and co-ordinated smear campaign to dictate Qatar's foreign policy"". .And Qatar's Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani, has made it clear there would be no negotiations until the punishing measures were lifted. .For the moment, it is hard to see a way out of a diplomatic deadlock which is also a deeply personal test of political wills. .Tensions have simmered for years as ambitious, gas-rich Qatar forged its own agenda in the region. .Powerful ruling families in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have kept a watchful and worried eye on Doha's support for Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, its relations with Riyadh's arch-rival Iran, as well as funding of jihadist forces including, they claim, groups linked to al-Qaida on the battlefields of Syria and Libya. Doha denies providing support to the most extreme Islamist groups. .Last week, the new offensive gathered pace as Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini foreign ministers converged on London with more ammunition to win over allies at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and woo the media. Qatar's foreign minister had been there just days before. .In the hushed surroundings of an elegant room in a London hotel, charge sheets of ""Qatari support for extremism"" were distributed by Emirati diplomats and aides. .Mr Gargash was categorical: ""This is about behaviour change, not regime change."" .He described plans for the monitoring system as still in the stage of ""vague ideas"". But he tried to make it crystal clear why it was needed. .""Fifty-nine people, many of them on the terrorist lists in the US or at the UN, are roaming free within the state of Qatar,"" he said in an interview after the press briefing. .And he pointed to an urgent need to monitor money flows after a recent ""episode"" in which ransom money, reportedly as much as a billion dollars, was dispatched to Iraq to free a hunting party, including Qatari princes, taken hostage by Iran-backed militias. .Iraqi officials are said to have seized the suitcases of money at the airport. .""There is zero trust,"" insisted Mr Gargash, who said a monitoring system was essential and could only work if ""our Western friends play a role"". .A few hours later, at the Saudi embassy in London, Mr Jubeir said they are also working on the list of grievances but made a point of saying: ""I would not call them demands."" He batted away suggestions this had more to do with Iran and regional rivalries. .""At its core, it's about stopping the funding of extremism and terrorism as well as incitement and interference in the affairs of other countries,"" he said. .""We hope wisdom will prevail and Qatar will respond,"" he said in an interview, calling it the ""demand of the whole world"". .But Qatar is pushing back against efforts to pull in outside powers instead of keeping this in the royal families. .""These allegations breach our Riyadh Agreement of 2014, which includes a mechanism to resolve our differences,"" pointed out the Qatari diplomat who sent his own charge sheet to me by email. .""We believe this crisis should be resolved within the GCC,"" he added, in reference to the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council, established in 1981 to consolidate countries' financial and political clout. .Kuwait's emir is shuttling between capitals, so far with little success. So is the foreign minister of Turkey, which along with Iran has offered assistance to Qatar to cope with shortages and travel disruption. Western diplomats, including Secretary Tillerson, are carefully calling for de-escalation and discussion. .Both the Saudi and Emirati ministers say they have tried dialogue before. They accuse Qatar's emir of breaking promises made three years ago. .So why now? Has their new ally in the White House now emboldened them? .""On a macro level, I would say yes,"" conceded Mr Gargash. ""We see the Trump administration's prioritisation of the fight against extremism and terrorism, and this is a big, big change."" .But this fight is a murky business in the region. Money from official and private sources has flowed to armed groups from most Gulf states for years. In Syria's war, it often amounted to sacks of cash dropped at hotels in Turkey. That is where accountability often ended as money moved across the border to messy battlefields. .Qatar repeatedly came under criticism in many capitals for allegedly backing the al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was previously known as al-Nusra Front and is one of the most formidable jihadist groups battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces. But other Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, also fund hardline Islamist fighters. .In recent years, Riyadh has taken steps to clamp down. .""We shut down the financing of terrorism,"" insists Mr Jubeir who, like his Emirati colleague, now refers to any misdirected funds as ""legacy"". .""We can't shut it completely but as much as we can, and more than any other country in the world."" .But Qatar says it has also taken action. Its reply to its neighbours' latest charge is to point to its bona fides as an active member of the US-led coalition against so-called Islamic State. .Just weeks before this crisis erupted, the US ambassador to Doha posted a tweet praising the country as ""a strong partner in combating terrorist financing"". .""The monitoring won't be effective if you single out one source,"" says Sultan Barakat, who heads the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies at the Doha Institute. .""There are sympathisers right across the region, some more dangerous than others."" .Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE accept that every country must play its part, but for now the target is Qatar and there is a lot at stake. .""If Qatar can be convinced to give up support for militant groups abroad, including the Muslim Brotherhood which isn't regarded by most countries as terrorist, they may as well give up having their own foreign policy and run it from Riyadh,"" explains a Western expert on Islamist movements. .It is not clear how far Qatar's critics will go. Mr Gargash admitted it was a dangerous moment. ""I'm worried less about escalation and more about isolation"" of Qatar, he said. .Both sides are now marshalling allies and political ammunition for what looks set to be a long haul. .Qatar crisis: Have Saudis gone too far? .Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims .Qatar crisis: What it means for travellers .Five surprising facts about Qatar",367

369,60,20 June 2017,Trumplomacy: Is there a Mideast strategy beyond arms sales?,".From now on the US can go back to selling precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia despite its poor record of avoiding civilian casualties in the Yemen conflict. .The state department has lifted a hold that Barack Obama had put on the sale after the Saudi-led coalition bombed a funeral reception, apparently by mistake, killing more than 100 people. .The state department argued that the precision munitions could improve Saudi targeting, and lawmakers had 30 days to review the reversal. They did come unusually close to blocking it, but time's run out. .The bigger question is whether this administration has a strategy for the Middle East beyond flooding it with weapons. .Arms sales were the centrepiece of President Donald Trump's recent visit to Saudi Arabia. He said his $110bn (£87bn) deal would create American ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" and help the Saudi-led bloc of Sunni countries battle so-called Islamic State (IS) and confront Iran. .Keeping up the tempo, the defence secretary last week signed a $12bn-deal to sell F-15 fighter jets to Qatar. .But that's a bit confusing because Saudi Arabia & Co have accused Qatar of funding terrorists and slapped it with a severe economic and diplomatic boycott, with President Trump cheering them on. .The bottom line, though, is that the Sunni states are not going to use these weapons against Iran directly. .Yes, deterrence and defence are a big part of the military build-up, but the active use of arms will be in messy proxy wars like the one in Yemen. .Which brings us back to the precision-guided missiles. .A resolution of disapproval for the sale was only narrowly defeated in the Senate, 47-53, showcasing growing unease among lawmakers. .There's concern over potential American complicity in possible violations of international humanitarian law, in a conflict that's plunged the country into famine. .It was an unprecedented outcome for a proposed weapons sale to what most senators accept is a strategic ally, albeit one that has its own problematic relationship with an extremist form of Islam. .We saw the beginnings of resistance in September with a similar motion to block a sale of battle tanks to Saudi Arabia, but that was soundly defeated. .The worsening situation in Yemen has changed the minds of some Senate Democrats. .So has the Trump factor. .Chris Murphy, one of the sponsors of the resolution, noted that Barack Obama sold more weapons to Saudi Arabia than all previous presidents combined. .But Mr Obama also curtailed Riyadh's fight for regional dominance and sought to rein in Iran's ambitions with political and diplomatic solutions. .President Trump, on the other hand, is ""definitively taking the Sunni side of the broadening set of proxy wars between the Saudis and the Iranians"", said Sen Murphy, which is ""deeply harmful to US national security"". .Strings attached? .Others talked about the apparent disconnect between the desire to sell more arms in the region, and an articulated strategy on ending the conflicts there. .""It's very confusing to world leaders and members of Congress when the Trump administration does two exactly opposite things"" on Qatar, Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu said at a recent congressional hearing on foreign weapons sales. .Rex Tillerson's latest statement only accentuates the differences: he questioned whether the embargo was triggered more by longstanding political disputes with Qatar than by concerns about its support for terrorism. .Whatever the case, the closeness of the Saudi vote was a shot across the bow for Riyadh, which denies it's primarily responsible for the civilian casualties in the battle against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. .US officials say no conditions were attached to the munitions sale. .Nevertheless someone conveniently leaked to the New York Times a letter from the Saudi foreign minister detailing new safeguards that sound a lot like conditions. .And, as part of the $110bn Saudi arms deal, the state department has approved a training programme contract aimed partly at helping prevent accidental killings of civilians. .The rest of the package could take years to clear its way through congress, bit by bit, since much of it is actually letters of intent for future sales. .Watch for more action from the Senate Resistance.

371,62,20 June 2017,What is behind tension between Eritrea and Djibouti?,".The African Union is sending a fact-finding mission to Eritrea and Djibouti as tension mounts over their disputed border at one of the world's busiest shipping routes. .The AU's move has been backed by the UN Security Council, which on 19 June urged the two countries to resolve their differences peacefully. .The tension has been driven by Qatar's move to withdraw its peacekeeping forces from the border. .The peacekeepers had been in place since 2010 as part of efforts to resolve a dispute over the status of Dumeira Mountain and Dumeira Island, claimed by both Djibouti and Eritrea. .The tiny Dumeira Island lies just off the coast of the two countries, at the southern end of the Red Sea. It is close to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, an important shipping lane for global commerce. .The two countries' armed forces clashed on the border in 2008. Both states later accepted Qatar's offer of mediation and the deployment of peacekeepers, though bilateral relations have remained strained. .The withdrawal of the Qatari peacekeepers appears to be related to the country's current diplomatic dispute with some of its Gulf neighbours, which over recent weeks have imposed a blockade. .On 16 June, Djibouti accused Eritrea of sending its troops into the disputed territory, following the withdrawal of the Qatari peacekeepers, a move that Doha had confirmed two days earlier, though without giving any reason. .Djibouti Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf accused Eritrea of occupying disputed territory on the border, and said his country wanted a peaceful solution but was ready for conflict if necessary. .Both Djibouti and Eritrea have sided with Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Qatar. .A statement issued by the Eritrean Information Ministry on 17 June made no direct mention of Djibouti's accusations of military activity. .""The government of Eritrea has so far refrained from issuing any statement, primarily because it is not privy to and has not, to date, obtained any information on the withdrawal from the party concerned: that is the State of Qatar,"" it said. .Ethiopia - by far the Horn of Africa's largest and most powerful country, which shares borders with both Eritrea and Djibouti - says it backs the African Union move to send a fact-finding mission, and has urged the UN to support the initiative. .The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry on 18 June called on its two neighbours to refrain from ""escalating tensions"" and instead ""resolve differences through peaceful means"". .Aside from the adverse security and humanitarian effects on the two states themselves, any military conflict between Eritrea and Djibouti has the risk of inflaming the much more serious and longer running border row between Eritrea and Ethiopia. .Ethiopia, which fought a border war with Eritrea in 1998-2000, enjoys good relations with Djibouti.

372,63,20 June 2017,The Barclays Four: Who are they?,".Four former top executives of Barclays bank have been charged with fraud over the way they staved off a potential taxpayer-bailout during the global financial crisis back in 2008. .But who are they? We look at the background of the four people involved: .Born in 1956, he studied history at Oriel College Oxford and then became a lawyer. He joined Barclays in 1982 in its then merchant banking division. .He became head of the bank's high street network in the UK and later became the group's finance director from 2000 to 2003. He was then appointed to the post of chief executive in 2004. .He retired in December 2010 but was kept on until September 2011 as a special adviser to the board on regulatory matters. .A profile in the Guardian from June 2007 described his enthusiasm for playing ping pong. .He was well known for wearing red braces at work and, unlike some bosses of very big firms, was affable towards journalists, frequently representing Barclays on radio and TV whenever the bank announced its annual results. .He was also happy to talk openly about the problems of the banking industry in private briefings for journalists. .Born in England in 1955, he studied economics at Heriot-Watt university. .According to the Times, he joined Barclays as a trainee in 1978 and rose steadily to become a top investment banker, reputedly one of the highest paid individuals in the City. .But his sporting life has, until now, been more interesting. He was a top rugby player at Edinburgh Academy, a leading private school. He also ran for Scotland in the 400 metres at the 1974 Commonwealth Games. .The year after, he won silver at the World Student Games. He is the younger brother of the sprinter David Jenkins, who was much more successful on the track, running in three Olympics and, in the 1972 games, winning a silver medal in the 400-metre relay. .Later David confessed to having taken anabolic steroids and was convicted for giving the drugs to other athletes in the US. .Roger left Barclays in 2009 and currently works for the Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual. The SFO says he currently lives in Malibu in California. .Aged 61, he is an American who lives in London. .Educated at the University of Chicago, he joined Barclays in 1996 after an 18-year career with the giant US bank JP Morgan where he started as a bond trader. .He became the head of Barclays Wealth from 2009 to 2013, the division that looks after the accounts and investments of rich personal clients and their families. .He left Barclays in April 2013 after a reorganisation of the bank's senior management that came in the wake of the departure, the year before, of the then Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. .Mr Kalaris went on to launch a private investment management business called Saranac in 2016. .He is aged 58, lives in London, and was a former senior manager for Barclays until he was sacked by the bank last year. .In an employment tribunal, which has been adjourned, his lawyers claimed his dismissal was a direct response to reading the 900 pages of evidence that Mr Boath had given in interviews to the SFO about the Qatar fund-raising. .Barclays charged with fraud in Qatar case .Why Barclays came under SFO fire",372
373,64,20 June 2017,Why has Barclays been charged?,".Barclays PLC and four former executives have been charged with fraud over their actions in the 2008 financial crisis. .The Serious Fraud Office case relates to the billions of pounds the bank raised from Qatari investors, enabling it to avoid a government bailout. .But what happened nine years ago and why have the company's actions been investigated? .There was a global financial crisis in 2008 and the financial markets plunged into chaos when the US government allowed the investment bank Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt. .This was an unprecedented incident and led to a chain of events including the value of shares in other US banks plummeting. .The problems rapidly spread around Western countries with the Republic of Ireland going into recession and three Icelandic banks collapsing, and, in the UK, the government having to rescue several banks including Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. .Barclays decided to go down a different path - and it is that decision that has led to the charges that it now faces. .Barclays decided not to rely on the taxpayer and boosted its coffers by raising £4.5bn in June 2008 and another £7.3bn four months later from a number of investors including state-owned investment fund Qatar Holdings. .The SFO investigation has been looking into exactly what Barclays paid to the Qatari investors for their participation in the October deal. .A total of £346m in advisory fees was paid to Qatar Holding. .Barclays also loaned £2bn to the state of Qatar only weeks after announcing the fundraising deal with the government-backed investment fund. .Under the Companies Act 1985, it is unlawful for a bank to lend itself money - the legal term for which is financial assistance. .Barclays has denied in court documents that the two transactions were linked. .The SFO has charged Barclays PLC, not the bank, and four former employees, including ex-chief executive John Varley, with fraud in relation to the June fund raising. .In addition, Mr Varley and Mr Jenkins have also been charged with the same offence in relation to the October 2008 fund raising and with providing unlawful financial assistance. .The SFO questioned 44 people during its five-year investigation into the case. .The four who have been charged all held senior roles during their time at the bank, but no longer work there. .John Varley, aged 61, was chief executive at Barclays between 2004 and 2011. .Roger Jenkins, 61, was the executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa. .Thomas Kalaris, 61, was chief executive of Barclays wealth and investment management. .Richard Boath, 58, was European head of financial institutions group. .The defendants will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court at 14:00 BST on 3 July. .Messrs Jenkins and Boath have both pledged to defend themselves against the charges, but there has been no comment yet from either of their other ex-colleagues. .Barclays has said it is considering its position and awaiting further details. .However, this may not be the end of the matter as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reopened its investigation into the deal and is understood to be reviewing new evidence which could prompt it to reconsider a £50m fine against the banking giant four years ago, which had been put on hold. .Barclays charged with fraud in Qatar case .Why Barclays came under SFO fire",373
374,65,20 June 2017,Barclays charged with fraud in Qatar case,".Barclays and four former executives have been charged with fraud over their actions in the 2008 financial crisis. .The Serious Fraud Office case relates to the way the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatari investors enabling it to avoid a government bailout. .Former chief executive John Varley is one of the four ex-staff who will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 3 July. .Barclays says it is considering its position and awaiting further details. .""The charges arise in the context of Barclays' capital raisings in June and November 2008. Barclays awaits further details of the charges from the SFO,"" the bank said in a statement. .It is the first time criminal charges related to the financial crisis have been brought against a bank in the UK. .Mr Varley, former senior investment banker Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris, a former chief executive of Barclays' wealth division, and Richard Boath, the ex-European head of financial institutions, have all been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud in the June 2008 capital raising. .In addition, Mr Varley and Mr Jenkins have also been charged with the same offence in relation to the October 2008 capital raising and with providing unlawful financial assistance. .Mr Jenkins will ""vigorously defend"" himself against the charges, his lawyer has told Reuters. .""As one might expect in the challenging circumstances of 2008, Mr Jenkins sought and received both internal and external legal advice on each and every topic covered by the SFO's accusations,"" said Brad Kaufman from American firm Greenberg Traurig. .Mr Boath, who last year took Barclays to an employment tribunal on the grounds of wrongful dismissal, also pledged to defend himself. .He said in a statement: ""The SFO's decision to charge me is based on a false understanding of my role and the facts. I was not a decision-maker and had no control over what the bank did in 2008."" .John Varley would for most have been an unlikely choice as the first former bank chief executive to face criminal charges over the events of the financial crisis. .Avuncular, calm, Mr Varley was one of the City's patricians, often portrayed - rightly or not - as a check on Barclays' hard-charging investment bank, led by Bob Diamond. .Now, along with the bank he once led, he faces two types of charges, both of which relate to fundraisings from Qatar in 2008. .The first charge, conspiracy to commit fraud, relates to ""advisory"" fees paid to Qatar. The second - ""unlawful assistance"" - could be more serious. .It relates to a £2bn loan advanced to Qatar after the fundraisings were negotiated, the implication being that there was a money-go-round at work - Barclays was handing Qatar some of the money it was using to support the British bank. .John Varley, aged 61, was chief executive at Barclays between 2004 and 2011. .Roger Jenkins, 61, was the executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa. .Thomas Kalaris, 61, was chief executive of Barclays wealth and investment management. .Richard Boath, 58, was European head of financial institutions group. .Barclays took £12bn from Qatar in 2008, as banks scrambled to avoid nationalisation. The SFO looked into payments made to Qatar at that time and afterwards. It also investigated whether those payments were correctly disclosed and if they might have been an inducement to Qatar to support the British bank. .The emergency funds allowed Barclays to avoid a government bailout in 2008 at a time when rivals Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were forced to rely on a taxpayer rescue. .Lord Myners tells Today Barclays charge is ""very, very significant"" .The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also reopened its probe into the deal and is understood to be reviewing new evidence which could prompt it to reconsider a £50m fine against the banking giant four years ago. .The FCA imposed the penalty after finding that Barclays had failed to disclose the arrangements and fees it paid to the Qatari investors, but Barclays contested the fine and it was put on hold while the SFO conducted its investigation. .Why has Barclays been charged? .The Barclays Four: Who are they? .Why Barclays came under fire",374
375,66,20 June 2017,Qatar Gulf row threatens cash crisis for Gaza,".In a playground in Sheikh Hamad City, children shriek with delight, while their parents chat in the cool shade of their peach-coloured flats. .This huge housing project - now one of the most desirable addresses in Gaza - was built since 2012 with money from Qatar and named after the former ruler of the wealthy Gulf state. .So far, more than 2,000 Palestinians - mostly low-income families - have moved in. .The complex has a new school, shops, an impressive mosque and plenty of greenery. There is a constant whirr of construction noise as more buildings are erected. .But as the regional crisis over Qatar escalates, Palestinians here - as elsewhere in the impoverished territory - fear the loss of their major donor and ally. .""We're going to be the victims,"" says one resident, Baha Shalaby. ""Everything's going to stop - the money, the support, the infrastructure, the building work."" .In recent years, Qatar has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new homes, a hospital and main roads in the Gaza Strip. It has pledged about $1bn (£780m) more. .It is not yet clear how its projects will be affected by the ongoing row with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries. They are trying to economically isolate Qatar, accusing it of fostering terrorism - a charge the emirate strongly denies. .However, the engineer in charge of fixing Gaza's main north-south road warns of the possible wider implications of any cuts. .""We have hundreds of workers, all supporting families,"" says Hanafi Sadallah. .""Levels of unemployment in Gaza are very high, so if the Qataris end our funding, they'll all just be left sitting at home."" .Just over 40% of Gazans are out of work, according to Palestinian officials - one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. .One of Saudi Arabia's demands has been for Qatar to stop backing Hamas, which runs Gaza. .The Islamist group took over by force a decade ago - ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces, a year after Hamas won legislative elections. .Hamas leaders insist that Qatari help to Gaza has been primarily charitable. .""The houses that were built are not for Hamas, the streets that were asphalted are not for Hamas,"" one senior figure, Mahmoud Zahar, tells the BBC. .""The humanitarian institutions - hospitals and schools, they're also for the Palestinian people. All attempts to hitch Hamas to Qatar are wrong and void."" .Israel says Hamas has also used foreign funding to bolster its military infrastructure, which its blockade aims to keep from strengthening. .To try to prevent any such accusations against its projects, Doha set up its own coordination office in Gaza and deals directly with contractors or works with UN agencies. .Nevertheless, Qatar's initiatives have buoyed Hamas through difficult times - the tight border restrictions imposed by both Israel and Egypt, and three bloody conflicts with Israel. .There has also been political and diplomatic support from Doha. .The emir of Qatar is the only head of state to have visited the Palestinian territory since Hamas has been in charge. .Many leaders of the group - including its former head, Khaled Meshaal, have been living in luxurious exile in Doha. .Now as Hamas seeks to ease pressure on its patron, several have reportedly left at Qatar's request. .Last month, the group also announced a new policy document in Doha, which tempered its long-held position against accepting an interim Palestinian state, and made no mention of its parent organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood. .The Brotherhood has been categorised as a terrorist group by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. .The latest developments concerning Qatar come amid mounting political and economic strain on Hamas. .US President Donald Trump has said that, alongside the so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and Hezbollah, Hamas is contributing to a regional ""humanitarian and security disaster"". .Last week, Israel agreed to a PA plan to cut power supplies to two million people in Gaza that will reduce their daily average of four hours of electricity by 45 minutes. .Hamas accuses its political rivals of plotting with the Trump administration and Israel to unseat it in Gaza. .Many of its members link local and wider regional developments. .""Qatar is being punished for speaking freely and supporting the Arab Spring,"" remarks Hamas parliamentarian, Yahya Musa, at a small rally in Sheikh Hamad City. .""It's being punished for supporting us and the resistance. We stand with our brothers to reject US plans against Qatar and the conspiracy against the resistance."" .As he speaks, children wave Palestinian and Qatari flags, alongside signs reading ""Solidarity with Qatar"" and ""We are all Qatar"". .The Palestinians here are banking on a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

They accuse the emirate of links to terror groups. .The account was restored by early afternoon Qatar time. .Twitter's rules state that an account can be suspended for three main reasons: because it is posting spam, because it has been hacked or compromised, or because it ""engages in abusive behaviour, like sending threats to others or impersonating other accounts"". .It is highly unusual for an account with as many followers, belonging to a national broadcaster, to be suspended. .A senior editor on the website wrote that there had been an ""on going storm of mass reporting"" of the account - of Twitter receiving significant numbers of complaints at the same time. .Accounts for Al Jazeera's different language services, as well as its Arabic-language breaking news account, had remained online. .Saudi Arabia has led moves to isolate the gas-rich emirate since earlier this month.

377,68,16 June 2017,Qatar crisis: Have Saudis gone too far?,".Gulf residents are still in shock. .Qatar, a sovereign Arab state, is being subjected to unprecedented sanctions by its Gulf Arab neighbours, led by Saudi Arabia. .The punishing economic and diplomatic measures have been taken because of allegations that Qatar has persisted in funding terrorist groups and destabilising the region, both of which it denies. .So now airspace has been closed, imports stopped at borders, Qatari expatriates expelled. .The veneer of Gulf Arab unity, as embodied in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), has worn off. .Even if, as expected, the immediate crisis is resolved by talks, the Gulf will never be the same again. .Now there are fears this action may push this region down a new and dangerous path. .The action against Qatar has been initiated by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt - four countries ruled by Sunni Muslim leaderships that see the world through the prism of two major threats to their rule: Iran and political Islam, coupled with violent jihad. .They accuse Qatar of encouraging both strands. .On Iran, the quartet's complaint appears to be excessive. .Qatar shares with Iran the world's largest natural gas condensate field - the offshore South Pars/North Dome Field. .Geography has made them neighbours, they need to get on. .But Saudi Arabia's rulers, encouraged by President Donald Trump's recent visit to Riyadh and his strong condemnation of Tehran, would prefer to see a united Gulf Arab stand against its arch rival Iran. .Qatar, in their eyes, is ""letting the side down"". .On political Islam, it is easier to see why the dynastic monarchies of the Gulf feel threatened by Qatar's actions. .Qatar's ruling family, the Al-Thani's, have long supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which espouses a pan-Islamic caliphate that would ultimately do away with current rulers. .Qatar has backed Islamist movements in Egypt, Libya, Syria and the Gaza Strip. .They have allowed the country's satellite TV channel, Al-Jazeera, to host vocal critics of Arab leaders, although not Qatar's. .The UAE Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, told me he sees the Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat to the region. .On terrorism, the picture is more opaque. .Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse Qatar of funding terrorist groups, notably in Syria and Iraq. .A lot of people say this is a case of hypocrisy, of the pot calling the kettle black. .In a failed bid to topple Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Saudi Arabia has itself funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars to hardline Sunni fighters in Syria, some of which has ended up in the hands of so-called Islamic State. .There is no denying though, that Qatar has had connections to the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front in Syria. .On one of my visits to the Qatari capital, Doha, Qatari intelligence officials personally told me in 2014 how they had successfully brought about the release of hostages held by this group. .That group would naturally have demanded something substantial in exchange. .In April this year it has been reported that a staggering $1bn (£784m) ransom was paid by Qatar to terrorist groups in Iraq, some of it to Iran, in order to secure the release of 26 princes kidnapped while hunting a large game bird called a bustard. .Qatar denies it. .While the action to isolate and punish Qatar reflects a joint view held by several countries, leading the charge is the 31-year-old Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister, Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. .The question many are asking now is whether MBS has gone too far. .Saudi Arabia already has enough trouble on its hands. .Together with the UAE, it's spent the last two years fighting an inconclusive and deeply destructive war in Yemen. .It's coping with a simmering insurgency in its Shia-dominated Eastern Province. .It is still part of the US-led coalition against IS, a group that has already bombed several Saudi mosques and threatened more attacks only this month. .The real long term cost of isolating Qatar may well turn out to be economic. .To attract business and provide jobs for their swelling youth population, the Gulf Arab states need stability and a business-friendly environment. .It is hard to see how this stand-off could do more to damage this. .The longer it persists, the deeper the wounds, not just to Qatar and its tiny, affluent population, but to the entire region. .The Qatar crisis explained .Why Qatar is focus of terrorism claims .Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar? .Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis? .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Qatar: 'There's no evidence' .How the row might affect you .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Five surprising facts about Qatar",377

But under the rules of airline industry body IATA, you must be offered the option of being rebooked onto other carriers. .So if, for example, you are due to fly from London to Dubai, via Doha, Qatar Airways has to find you an alternative - either a direct or indirect flight. .It says it will do that, but it all depends on availability, so potentially you may not travel exactly when planned. .Again, to make these arrangements call +974 4023 0072 or contact your nearest Qatar Airways office. .The airline says things proceed as normal. You can still fly in and out of Qatar's hub in Doha. .So a journey from, say, Singapore to London via Doha is unaffected. .But because Qatar Airways is not using the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain or Egypt it has just a narrow strip to operate in, meaning it is having to take different routes. .On some routes this will add to flight times (as well as Qatar's fuel bill) - though the airline has not yet said how much difference it is likely to make to trip durations. .It's not just Qatar Airways. If you are due to fly in or out of Qatar from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Bahrain then your flight will not be taking off. .Airlines operating these routes include Etihad, Emirates, Flydubai, Air Arabia, Gulf Air, Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) and Egyptair. .All airlines seem to be offering the same options - either a full refund on unused tickets or rebooking onto the nearest alternative destination on its network. .Emirates: You can apply online for refunds or contact your local Emirates office. .Etihad: Passengers should call +971 2599 0000 or visit its website. .FlyDubai: Call +971 600544445, +974 4 4227350/51, contact your travel agent or send a private message to its Facebook page. .Air Arabia: The airline - which operates from two of the UAE's northern emirates - says passengers should call +971 6 5580000 or go to its website. .Gulf Air: Passengers booked on Bahrain's national carrier can call +973 17373737 or visit its website. .Saudia and Egyptair have not issued specific contact numbers. .Given there's no direct travel, you could fly to another location that is not part of the ban, and then go from there. .For example Oman Air and Kuwait Airways are still operating Doha flights so passengers could travel via Muscat or Kuwait City. .Bear in mind though that if you are a citizen of the UAE, Saudi, Bahrain, Egypt, Yemen or Libya you won't be allowed into Qatar, and vice versa, Qataris are being told to leave countries that have cut ties. .There's no fixed end date for this. .Nobody appears to be taking any booking on this route for the next month. Of course there's a chance this will be resolved sooner than this. Or, indeed, that it will go on far longer. .Qatar backs talks to end Gulf crisis .What's behind crisis with Qatar? .Qatar row threatens food and flights .'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts .Qatar hacking row fuels Gulf tensions",380
381,2,14 June 2017,Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar?," .""Thank you Turkey for the milk!"" posted one Twitter user from Qatar, along with a picture taken in a supermarket whose shelves were full of Turkish-brand bottles. .Over the weekend, fresh stocks of milk, yogurt, poultry and juice from Turkey were flown to Doha as the country faced a shortage of fresh produce due to the recent crisis in the Gulf - the worst in the past decade. .On Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the isolation of Qatar as inhumane and against Islamic values, comparing it to a ""death sentence"". .His foreign minister is due to visit the country on Wednesday for talks about the crisis. .As Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt decided to sever all ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism, Turkey's initial reaction was to try to refrain from taking sides and to call for dialogue. .But just two days later Ankara made a dramatic pro-Qatari turn. .The passing of a bill to authorise the deployment of Turkish troops to Qatar was presented to the international community as a clear message: Doha is not alone. .In fact, the bill had been waiting for parliamentary approval for almost two years - long before the Qatar crisis erupted. .The two countries had already signed a military protocol back in 2015, and Turkey had opened a military base in Qatar - its first in the region, currently hosting about 100 Turkish soldiers, but with a capacity of up to 5,000 troops. .On Monday, the Turkish army sent a further three officers to co-ordinate the future deployment. Some reports suggest that Ankara will initially deploy infantry, then a naval force, followed by F16 fighter jets. .Ankara perceives Doha as one of its key allies, especially after Turkey's increasing isolation internationally. .Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani was the first leader to make a solidarity call to President Erdogan after the Turkish coup attempt last year. .There are even reports alleging that a 150-strong elite unit of Qatari special forces was sent to Turkey for close protection of Mr Erdogan after the coup plot. .The governments of the two countries also share similar ideological stances. .Neither classifies the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas as ""terrorist organisations""; both have condemned the military coup in Egypt that toppled Mohammed Morsi in 2013; and both have supported Islamist groups in their attempt to overthrow Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. .They also have the same attitude towards Iran. Both acknowledge that it is one of the key players in the region and try to maintain good ties - contrary to the Saudi demonisation of Tehran. .Qatar has also been investing heavily in Turkey - it ranks seventh in terms of Doha's foreign investments. .Turkish exports to Qatar are valued at more than $420m (£330m), and the emirate is seeking several arms deals with Turkish defence firms. .The value of projects undertaken in Qatar by more than 30 Turkish companies, mainly in the construction sector, has reached approximately $8.5bn to date, according to official numbers. .And with the 2022 World Cup's preparations under way, Turkish contractors are eyeing the country for further investments. .Mr Erdogan has demanded an immediate end to the Qatar crisis, calling on the Saudi king to take the lead to resolve it. .Although taking a pro-Qatari position, Turkey does not want to be perceived as anti-Saudi. .What it wants first and foremost is a diplomatic settlement to restore the relations between the parties. .But if the tension escalates further leading to a military confrontation, or a coup, will Turkey still be prepared to stand by its recently adopted ""brother""?",381
382,3,13 June 2017,Turkey's Erdogan decries Qatar's 'inhumane' isolation," .Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced the isolation of Qatar by several Arab states, describing it as ""inhumane and against Islamic values"". .Last week's decision by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt to sever all ties was like a ""death penalty"", Mr Erdogan said. .Qatar was accused of aiding terrorist groups and Iran - charges it denied. .Mr Erdogan vowed to help Qatar overcome the effects of the crisis, which he said Saudi Arabia needed to resolve. .Turkey has already flown dairy products, poultry and juice to Doha, which began to arrive on supermarket shelves over the weekend. .Morocco, which has said it will remain neutral in the dispute, announced on Monday evening that it would also send planeloads of food to prevent shortages. .The decision was made ""in conformity with Islamic precepts that call for solidarity and mutual aid between Muslim people, notably during this holy month of Ramadan"", according to a foreign ministry statement. .On 5 June, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt announced that they were severing air, sea and land links with Qatar. The three Gulf states also ordered their citizens out of Qatar and gave Qataris in their countries 14 days to leave. .The decision caused turmoil in Qatar, an oil- and gas-rich nation that is dependent on imports to meet the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million and is a major international travel hub. .In a speech at a parliamentary meeting in Ankara on Tuesday, Mr Erdogan said the methods employed by Qatar's neighbours were unacceptable. .""A very grave mistake is being made in Qatar, isolating a nation in all areas is inhumane and against Islamic values. It's as if a death penalty decision has been taken for Qatar,"" he added. .Mr Erdogan dismissed the allegations against Qatar, insisting the emirate had taken ""the most decisive stance"" against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). .""Victimising Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose,"" he said. .He did not directly criticise Saudi Arabia, but said that as ""the elder statesman of the Gulf"" Saudi King Salman should ""solve this affair and show leadership"". .Later, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir insisted that there was ""no blockade"". .""Qatar is free to go - the ports are open, the airports are open,"" he said after meeting US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington. ""What we have done is we have denied them use of our airspace, and this is our sovereign right."" .Mr Jubeir added that Saudi Arabia would send food or medical aid through the King Salman Centre for Humanitarian Aid and Relief if needed. .Mr Tillerson has called for the restrictions to be ""eased"", but President Donald Trump has expressed his support for them despite Qatar hosting the largest US military base in the Middle East. .""We are stopping the funding of terrorism,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""We are going to starve the beast."" .Qatar admits it has backed Islamist groups across the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood. But it denies supporting or funding jihadist groups like IS or al-Qaeda. It also rejects claims that it is too close to Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. .""We still have no clue what is behind these measures,"" said Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani during a visit to Paris on Monday. .""Whatever is related to the collective security of the Gulf countries, Qatar is ready to negotiate... but we have the right to react to these accusations that we are interfering in their internal affairs."" .Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar? .Why Qatar is focus of terrorism claims .The Qatar crisis explained .Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis? .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Qatar: 'There's no evidence' .How the row might affect you .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Five surprising facts about Qatar",382
383,4,13 June 2017,Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims," .The dispute that has seen Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies isolate Qatar stems from allegations that the tiny gas-rich nation is sponsoring extremist groups which are destabilising the Middle East. .This is not the first time Qatar's neighbours have expressed their displeasure over its individualist foreign policy - diplomatic relations were severed for nine months in 2014. .Tensions have arisen from Qatar's support for the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood; its close relationship with groups such as the Taliban and certain al-Qaeda affiliates; and its relationship with Iran, which has most recently led to allegations from Saudi Arabia that the state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera is supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen fighting government forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. .Doha has strongly denied Riyadh's accusations, and said it has taken more robust counter-terrorism measures than some of its neighbours. .Yet this latest row is shining a particular light on the role Qatar plays with its immense wealth. .In April, it reportedly paid a ransom of as much as $1bn (£790m) to a former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria and to Iranian security officials as part of a deal that resulted in the release of 26 royal family members reportedly kidnapped by Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militiamen and of dozens of Shia fighters captured by jihadists in Syria. .Thus it is Qatar's alleged continued funding of radical ideology and extremism that is seemingly the cause of concern this time. .Since 9/11, the United States-led global effort to disrupt terrorist financing has been relentless. Domestic laws and United Nations Security Council Resolutions have been passed; entities and individuals have been subject to national and UN sanctions; and suspected conduits for terrorist funding, such as remittance companies and charities, have been shut down. .But despite all this, the commitment of some key nations, including Qatar, has been repeatedly questioned. .In 2014, then-US Treasury Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen noted: ""Qatar, a long-time US ally, has for many years openly financed Hamas, a group that continues to undermine regional stability. Press reports indicate that the Qatari government is also supporting extremist groups operating in Syria."" .He also drew attention to the ""permissive"" environment in Qatar that allowed fundraisers to solicit donations for extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. .In 2016, Mr Cohen's replacement at the US treasury department, Adam Szubin, noted that despite showing willingness to take enforcement action against terrorist financiers, Qatar had ""a way to go"" and lacked ""the necessary political will and capacity to effectively enforce their counter-terrorism finance laws against all terrorist financing threats"". .In response to these failings, the US has sanctioned several Qatari citizens for financing terrorism. .Yet despite leading the opposition to Qatar's financial activities - and no doubt emboldened by the recent visit to Riyadh by US President Donald Trump - Saudi Arabia has not escaped similar criticism. .Fifteen of the 19 aircraft hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens; diplomatic cables from 2009 published by Wikileaks reflect regular US frustration at the difficulty of persuading the Saudi government to treat terrorist financing donors as a strategic priority; and the country has used its considerable hydrocarbon wealth to propagate its fundamentalist Wahhabi strain of Islam via schools and mosques around the world which have been accused by some of being a source of extremism. .Although a small number of individuals and entities in Saudi Arabia are alleged to have financed terrorism, the country is seemingly on much more supportive ground than Qatar, and is recognised for its efforts. .Indeed, during President Trump's visit, the US and Saudi governments announced the inauguration of a jointly-led regional Terrorist Financing Targeting Centre to counter new and evolving threats from terrorist financing, perhaps reflecting the extent to which Saudi Arabia has, in Washington's view, moved from being a terrorist financing problem to a key part of the solution in the Gulf region. .Yet this apparent commitment by Saudi Arabia to tackle terrorist financing may not be enough. .Although the direct financing of terrorist groups has unsurprisingly been the primary focus of policymakers and security authorities, more recently attention has expanded to include those who fund organisations and individuals who promote radical or extremist ideologies. .Speaking in December 2015 during a House of Commons debate on extending UK bombing of so-called Islamic State from Iraq into Syria, then-Prime Minister David Cameron committed to ""establish a comprehensive review to root out any remaining funding of extremism within the UK... [examining] the nature, scale and origin of the funding of Islamist extremist activity in the UK, including any overseas sources"". .Recent media reports suggest that, whilst completed, this review is unlikely to be made public. .Which brings us back to the current state of Gulf affairs. .The suggestions are that, as before, this crisis will quickly pass. But the increased focus this spat has brought to the financing of terrorism and extremist ideology will endure and, however unreasonable it believes this to be, Doha can expect to remain the centre of intense suspicion. .Tom Keatinge is director of the Centre for Financial Crime & Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).

Three ships carrying 350 tonnes (385 tons) of food are also set to leave Iran. .Qatar's foreign minister says 16% of Qatar's food supplies were transported across its land border with Saudi Arabia, which was closed last week. The crossing was also used for imports of building supplies and electronic equipment. .In a separate development on Monday, Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National reported that the UAE would not deport Qataris married to Emirati nationals. .It came a day after the authorities in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain said they were setting up hotlines to help families with Qatari members. .Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis? .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Trump claims credit for Qatar isolation .Qatar: 'There's no evidence' .The Qatar crisis explained .How the row might affect you .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Five surprising facts about Qatar",384

390,11,9 June 2017,Qatar: Buying Britain by the pound," .It's hard to walk round London and admire the sights without admiring something paid for by Qatar. .From some of the most famous hotels and landmarks to the cranes arcing over the South Bank, Qatar has a substantial finger in a huge number of pies. .The UK is Qatar's single largest investment destination, with £35bn in place and another £5bn on its way in the next five years. .And it is now said that Qatar owns more land in London than the Queen. .The next batch of £5bn is headed for sectors ranging from infrastructure and energy to IT. .However, the pace may be slowing slightly after a rapid acceleration in the last five to 10 years, and Qatar's focus is turning instead to the US, where it aims to invest some $35bn (£27bn). .Both here and in the US, the investments will be largely channelled through the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) the country's sovereign wealth fund, that has a global portfolio worth about $335bn. .And it all comes from gas. .Qatar's oil output is relatively modest. But it is, through happy geological coincidence, situated on top of the South Pars Field, the single largest known natural gas field in the world, which straddles the Gulf. .The property research company Datscha revealed that the QIA owns 879 commercial and residential properties in London. .Of that, about 26 million sq ft is commercial property. .Central to its property empire is the Canary Wharf Group (CWG), which it bought with partners Brookfield Property Partners in 2015 for £2.6bn. .CWG owns some 16 million sq ft in the heart of London, including 20 Fenchurch Street, nicknamed the Walkie Talkie, and the Shell Centre redevelopment on London's South Bank. .The QIA separately bought the HSBC Tower at 8 Canada Square in 2014 for £1.1bn. .It also has a stake in London's Savoy Hotel (through owning 10% of the French hospitality group Accor), and a 95% stake in the Shard. It bought the Harrods department store for a reported £1.5bn in 2010. .Meanwhile, Qatari Diar, the QIA's real estate development unit, is busy converting the US Embassy on London's Grosvenor Square into a luxury hotel, and is building homes at the former Chelsea Barracks which it markets as ""the most coveted 12.8 acres in the world."" .Qatari Diar also has a partnership with the real estate investment company Delancey and the Dutch pension fund asset manager, APG to develop and rent the 2012 Olympic Athletes' Village, known as East Village, and the Elephant and Castle redevelopment. .In all, that's about 4,000 residential units, managed and leased through the Get Living brand. .Another unit of the QIA, Qatar Holding, owns a string of hotels in London - not just any old hotels, but Claridge's, the Berkeley and the Connaught, as well as the Intercontinental in Park Lane, through a 64% stake in Coroin, the holding company which owns the Maybourne Hotel Group. .Across England and Wales, Datscha estimates the rateable value of all the QIA's properties is more than £1bn. Rateable value is not how much the properties are worth - it's based on the rentable value, so it represents the rent that could be charged in a year on all the properties. .Qatari individuals have also pumped money into London real estate. No 1 Hyde Park is a 380,000 sq ft development of some 83 apartments, considered by some to be the most expensive address in Europe. .It is joint owned by the CPC Group and Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, former prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of Qatar. .An investigation by Vanity Fair in 2013 found that 64 of the apartments were held by companies registered in offshore tax havens. .Qatar is also bound into the UK economy through trade. And for Qatar, trade means liquefied natural gas (LNG). .Natural gas makes up about 29% of the UK's fuel imports and of that, about 29% is in the form of LNG, transported in double-hulled, temperature-controlled ships, such as the distinctive ""Dinosaur Egg Carriers"". .Qatar provides nearly all the UK's LNG. It comes through the South Hook Terminal at Milford Haven, which is 67.5% owned by Qatar Petroleum. .Then there are the strategic stakes in some of the country's biggest corporate names. The QIA has bought 22% of Sainsbury's and 20% of London Heathrow airport. .Since July last year, Qatar Airways is the biggest shareholder in British Airways owner IAG, with a 20% stake. .These kinds of investments do not come without a degree of controversy. .The Chelsea Barracks site has had a chequered history after Prince Charles lambasted the modernist design and the whole project was put on ice until 2015. .More serious is the cloud hanging over Qatar's interests in Barclays bank. At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Qatar and Abu Dhabi pumped some £7.3bn into Barclays bank as it attempted to avoid being bailed out by the UK government, Qatar paying £4bn. .But the manner in which Barclays raised the funds is being scrutinised by two UK regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Serious Fraud Office, and there is a separate lawsuit in which the private equity company PCP Partners is claiming £700m from Barclays in allegedly unpaid fees. .Qatar Holding is not under investigation. It still holds 6% of Barclays. .The country has also been making inroads into other areas of UK banking. .In 2009, the Qatari Investment Bank bought 44% of the venerable London stockbrokers Panmure Gordon. .Earlier this year, it made what it called a ""joint bid"" with Atlas Merchant Capital - the private equity firm of former Barclays boss Bob Diamond - to ""take Panmure Gordon private and reposition the company as a key boutique investment bank in the UK market"". .Qatar bid wins Canary Wharf battle .Qatar crisis: What's it about? .Qatar announces £5bn UK investment",390
391,12,9 June 2017,Qatar crisis: The deep diplomatic tensions behind the row," .Sometimes the recipe for a dispute says ""leave to simmer"". This one has been simmering for years. But then suddenly some of the cooks increase the heat substantially and dispute boils over into full-blown crisis. .The underlying tensions between Qatar and three of her Gulf neighbours in particular have been visible for two decades. This is a region largely of absolute monarchs - kings or emirs - who have in common a very firm grip on politics at home, to head off any dissent which could represent a threat to their individual regime survival. .But the emir of Qatar pursues a series of policies which simply don't fit into the rigid orthodoxy expected by most of the others, notably Saudi Arabia, the superpower of Sunni Islam. .His unconventional foreign policy is seen as a threat to Sunni solidarity, particularly because the emir and his ministers promote dialogue and a search for good relations with the rival regional superpower, Shia Muslim Iran. .Saudi Arabia is deeply hostile to that approach and now feels empowered to turn that hostility to action, in the certain knowledge that a new president, Donald Trump, is at Saudi King Salman's side. .The core charge laid against Qatar as justification for this week's new and punitive blockade is the country's alleged funding of religious extremists, including the secret arming of some jihadi groups. .Those are charges rejected by Qatar's government and similar ones have also been levelled in the past at many of those now condemning the country, notably Saudi Arabia. .But the single most powerful motive behind the blockade may be a quite different one: the desire to rein in, or even to close down, one of the emir of Qatar's most cherished projects - the global television news channels of Al-Jazeera. .He sees Al-Jazeera as an agent of positive change across the Arab world, opening up political debate, reporting on the challenges from ordinary people from the street, so evident during the ""Arab Spring"". .However odd, even hypocritical it may seem for an absolute monarch in Qatar, a country devoid of elected politicians, to champion the cause of disaffected citizens demanding change elsewhere, that is a large part of what drives this emir, set on what he regards as a path of Middle East modernisation. .His fellow autocrats see things quite differently, in Egypt as well as the Gulf. There, President Sisi drove the Muslim Brotherhood out of elected government and to near oblivion, branding them as intolerable Islamists. .Al-Jazeera was painted as a propagandist for the Brotherhood. That's a portrayal other leaders who have been challenged by the station are happy to endorse, leaving the broadcaster as now another substantial target of the action against Qatar. .So, how will this crisis end? .There's no sign of any real progress towards a settlement yet, rather the reverse. The rift seems to be both deeper and wider than it was at the start of the week. .Deeper because the accusations being thrown about on both sides are becoming harsher. The United Arab Emirates is amplifying the charge that Qatar encourages extremism. .Qatar, through its Human Rights Council, is saying Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE together are abusing the human rights of all those caught up in the programme of expulsions and flight bans, separating families for whom the borders between Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries have never been closed in this way before. .And it is becoming a wider rift as more and more outside countries weigh in and take sides. .Several member states of the Arab League have lined up behind the anti-Qatar campaign. Equally, both Turkey and Russia are consolidating their positions as friends to Qatar. .Turkey passed a law in near record time this week which would allow an accelerated deployment of Turkish troops to Qatar: something already possible but on a longer timeframe. Russia has invited Qatar's embattled foreign minister for talks in Moscow which Qatar hopes to use to maximise support. .Meanwhile, the emir of Kuwait, playing a customary role as peacemaker within the GCC, faces his toughest task yet, shuttling between the royal courts of Gulf capitals trying to find a way through which somehow curbs Qatar's sovereignty - the demand of others - and does not curb that sovereignty, the insistence of the emir who rules in Doha. .There's no sign yet of any such progress being made. This feels like a crisis which will be maintained at high temperature for some time. .That alarms much of the outside world, fearing even greater instability in the Middle East, and this time instability in the area they normally rely on for dependable, but certainly not democratic, calm. .Trump claims credit for Qatar isolation .Five surprising facts about Qatar .Profile: Qatar Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani .Qatar country profile",391

394,15,8 June 2017,Qatar crisis: Can Al Jazeera survive?," .Qatar's Al Jazeera media network has undoubtedly put the tiny Gulf state on the international map. .It is the showpiece of the oil- and gas-rich nation's efforts to turn its financial largesse into outsized global influence and visibility, a two-decades long effort that includes its successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. .But there are growing fears that the current diplomatic crisis in Qatar could place the high-profile network's future in jeopardy. .Al Jazeera's broadcasting has caused controversy and drawn anger in various Arab states, not least in Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring and the subsequent ousting of the elected president, Mohammed Morsi - a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. .It has already been caught up in the current crisis, with its website blocked by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain in late May. .Those nations all severed ties with Qatar on 5 June, accusing the country of supporting extremism. Saudi Arabia has closed Al Jazeera's offices and withdrawn its broadcast licence, saying it promotes terrorist ""plots"", supports Houthi militias that Saudi Arabia is fighting in Yemen, and has attempted to ""break the Saudi internal ranks"". .Al Jazeera says it is ""not partisan to any ideology, group or government"". .Qatar crisis: What's it about? .Qatar travel: What does it mean for me? .Qatar now finds itself isolated and vulnerable. It denies backing terrorist groups but will be pressed for concessions in order to resolve the tense situation, which left its international airport, a key hub, virtually deserted, and residents stocking up on food supplies. .BBC Arabic's Feras Kilani, in Doha, says sources tell him that media reforms will be a key condition placed on Qatar. Al Jazeera might not be closed but its editorial policies will have to change, he says, while the newer Qatari Al-Araby TV network, based in London, could be shuttered. .""For many years Al Jazeera has been a bone of contention for the Gulf states and Egypt, even before its heyday of rolling news coverage during the Arab Spring,"" writes the Emirati commentator Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi. .He points out that in 2002, Saudi Arabia was angered over coverage of its peace plan for the Israel-Palestinian conflict and recalled its ambassador from Qatar as a result. An ambassador was only sent back in 2008. .In 2014, Qatar promised to stop ""interfering"" in its Gulf neighbours' domestic politics to resolve another diplomatic spat that saw Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain withdraw their ambassadors .This time around, Qatar's neighbours in the Gulf ""will demand the complete shuttering of the Al-Jazeera TV network before any mediation can take place"", Mr Qassemi predicts. .That would have major consequences for the country's media ambitions, and for the network's 3,000-plus staff in Doha and around the world. .Muslim Brotherhood: From rapid rise to sharp decline .Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? .Qatar's ""current crisis represents a new challenge and new circumstances"" for Al Jazeera, said Giles Trendle, the acting managing director of Al Jazeera English. .""But Al Jazeera remains committed to continue its pioneering and courageous journalism around the world in a professional, balanced and objective manner."" .He added that ""only those who want to see one side of the story told"" would consider the network biased towards the Muslim Brotherhood or any other group. .Qatar finds itself in a delicate position, says H A Hellyer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council. .It is perceived as a ""loose cannon"" over coverage of the Muslim Brotherhood, he says, and its relationship with Saudi Arabia's chief rival for regional influence, Iran. .US President Donald Trump, a key ally, has meanwhile praised Qatar's isolation. .The country has little wiggle room, and any deal to bring Qatar's foreign policy closer in line with Saudi Arabia's will probably involve changes to its influential media networks - including Al Jazeera - and possibly the end of Al-Araby Al Jadeed (The New Arab), an outlet part of the same company as Al-Araby, Mr Hellyer writes. .David Roberts, a Qatar expert at King's College London, agrees that Al Jazeera will probably be on the Gulf countries and Egypt's ""shopping list"" of concessions they want from Qatar. .""But this is a negotiation and there is no certainty that Qatar would capitulate on this point,"" he told the BBC. .He says that Al Jazeera Arabic, although it has toned down its coverage, ""is still prickly towards Egypt in particular"". .But the channel did stop ""going after"" Saudi Arabia close to a decade ago - around the time the ambassador was returned. .It has been reported that in late 2007, Qatar's government assured Saudi Arabia that its coverage of the kingdom would be mellowed as it moved to reset relations as Iran's nuclear ambitions grew. .""Orders were given not to tackle any Saudi issue without referring to the higher management,"" a newsroom employee told the New York Times. ""All dissident voices disappeared from our screens."" .Others aren't convinced that the end of Al Jazeera will be a specific demand made of Qatar, but agree its foreign policy will undoubtedly have to change if it wants to bring an end to its current isolation. .This means changes to the tone and coverage of government-funded media networks like Al Jazeera would follow, says Professor Noha Mellor, a pan-Arab media expert at the University of Bedfordshire. .""They might just tone down their media discourse in line with their foreign policy, because [Qatar's] foreign policy will have to tone down, in style and ambition."" .Al Jazeera's Arabic channel was strongly supportive of the 2011 Arab uprisings and it has veered towards an overtly pro-Islamist line amid the upheavals that have engulfed the region since. .With that shift, the channel has come to be perceived as a pillar of Qatar's foreign policy and a reflection of its ambitions in a changing Arab world. .Al Jazeera was at the forefront of tensions that strained relations between Egypt and Qatar after the toppling of Mohammed Morsi in 2013. .In Syria and Iraq, Al Jazeera's coverage of the so-called Islamic State (IS) militant group has differed from other outlets. .In referring to the group, Al Jazeera uses the expression ""the state organisation"", which is not very far removed from what IS calls itself, as opposed to the pejorative Arabic acronym ""Daesh"" used by Saudi media, including Al Jazeera competitor Al-Arabiya. .In 2015, Al Jazeera used the positive term ""Sunni revolutionaries"" to refer to Sunni fighters, including IS militants, who took control of Iraq's key city of Mosul. .Egypt jails al-Jazeera journalists .Al Jazeera network to cut 500 jobs .Al Jazeera America to shut news channel .Trump claims credit for Qatar isolation .Qatar: 'There's no evidence' .The Qatar crisis explained .How the row might affect you .What's behind crisis with Qatar? .Qatar Airways licence revoked .Qatar row threatens food and flights .Five surprising facts about Qatar .'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts .Travellers hit by grounded Qatar flights .Qatar hacking row fuels Gulf tensions .Qatar country profile .Islamic State: Where key countries stand .Qatar isolated by its neighbours .Muslim Brotherhood: From rapid rise to sharp decline",394

400,21,7 June 2017,Trumplomacy: Should Trump be patting himself on the back over Qatar?," .In the sledgehammer world of Twitter diplomacy, President Donald Trump has struck a blow to the carefully crafted House of Cards that is Middle East policy. .Not only did he take sides in a deep and longstanding rift in the Arab world, he took some credit for it. .According to @realDonaldTrump, the president's recent visit to Saudi Arabia paid off with a harder line against extremist funding, rightly directed at Qatar. .In other words, he'd inspired an unprecedented decision by Arab allies to cut ties with another American ally whom they accuse of supporting terrorism. .First of all, to what degree should Mr Trump be patting himself on the back? .Qatar's foreign minister says there is no evidence of support for radical Islam .It's true the diplomatic breach is a huge escalation, but it's based on longstanding tensions. .Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt are angered by Qatar's support for Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which they see as a political threat; annoyed by Doha's brash satellite channel Al Jazeera; and convinced it's open to backing the agenda of Iran, their regional rival. .That suspicion reportedly exploded into fury recently when Doha paid a huge ransom to secure the release of Qatari royal family members kidnapped in southern Iraq by Shia militias connected to Iran. .Much of the money is believed to have made its way to Tehran. It was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"", one Gulf observer told the Financial Times. .Five things you may not know about Qatar .Nevertheless, President Trump's forceful affirmation of Saudi positions during his recent trip, especially its stance against Iran, may have emboldened the kingdom to cut Qatar off. .Qatar Airways passengers in Abu Dhabi vent frustration .At any rate, Riyadh was confident enough to give the US a heads-up only just before it made the announcement, blindsiding officials here. .To be clear, when it comes to terrorist financing, nobody's hands are clean: the Qataris, Saudis and Kuwaitis have all funded extremists in the Syria conflict. .All have pulled back from that under US pressure. But Qatar's dealings are arguably murkier than the others because it likes to see itself as a neutral player that can act as an intermediary, and is thus willing to play both sides. .And to be sure, the US has concerns about Qatari behaviour. .So it is a nuanced relationship, not least because Qatar hosts America's biggest airbase in the Middle East - the nerve centre of its air war against the Islamic State group - to which Doha has contributed billions of dollars. .Which has left the Pentagon, and especially the State Department, in an awkward position: they are accustomed to working in shades of grey rather than the merciless black and white of 140 characters. .Spokespeople didn't reject or affirm the president's tweets. Instead, they pulled out traditional talking points. .Heather Nauert at the State Department praised Qatar's continuing efforts to stop the financing of terrorist groups, but said there was more work to do. .The Pentagon renewed praise of Qatar for hosting US forces, and lauded Doha's ""enduring commitment to regional security"". .It said the feud hadn't affected military operations, but presumably it could if it goes on for too long, and even the White House was calling for a truce. .""The US still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately,"" said spokesman Sean Spicer, at the same time defending the president's use of social media to speak ""straight to the American people"". .The State Department, though, wants to change the subject. .""Let's move off from this social media thing,"" Ms Nauert told journalists peppering her with questions about the impact of Twitter diplomacy. .Tell that to the president. .Are you due to fly to or from Qatar? Will you be affected by the disruption? Let us know by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk .You can also contact us in the following ways:",400

Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" he tweeted. .Kuwait - one of the Gulf countries not involved in the dispute - has offered to mediate talks, and Qatar said it was receptive to dialogue. .In an interview with Qatar's al-Jazeera network, the Qatari foreign minister said Kuwait's emir would travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for talks. .Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera that Qatar was seeking ""a dialogue of openness and honesty"". .Six countries - Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives - cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday. .Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have given Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, and banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar. .The evidence of the rift is clear at Doha's airport, the BBC's James Robbins reports .The states that joined Monday's move against Qatar, a tiny but gas-rich peninsula, include some of the biggest powers in the Arab world. .Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE closed all transport links by air, land and sea. .The UAE and Egypt expelled Qatari diplomats, giving them 48 hours to leave, and Saudi Arabia closed down a local office of al-Jazeera. .Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. .Airlines affected by the airspace restrictions include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. .When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. .On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia revoked Qatar Airways' licence and ordered the company's Saudi offices to shut within 48 hours. .In a country reliant on imported food, residents have started to stockpile. .""People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones,"" one Doha resident, Eva Tobaji, told Reuters. ""It's chaos - I've never seen anything like this before."" .A substantial amount of Qatar's food is transported across the border from Saudi Arabia, which is being closed. That is also an important route for construction materials - needed for the energy industry and for the preparations for the 2022 football world cup. .Qatar's exports are dominated by oil and gas. They are mostly seaborne, so should not be immediately hit, but the general economic disruption could have an impact if the dispute drags on. .That possibility pushed the price of crude oil higher, but only briefly. Qatar is a member of the exporters' group Opec and the dispute could yet undermine the organisation's efforts to raise prices by restricting production. .While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. .Broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. .Wealthy individuals in Qatar are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria - Qatar says this is not the case. .The Financial Times also reports that Gulf allies were angry that Qatar paid a $1bn (£773m) ransom to jihadists and Iranian security officials after Qatari nationals were kidnapped in Iraq and Syria. .Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. .Analysts also say the timing of the diplomatic withdrawal, two weeks after a visit to Riyadh by President Trump, is crucial. .Mr Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia, in which he blamed Iran for instability in the Middle East and urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, is likely to have emboldened Gulf allies to act against Qatar. .In the same week as Mr Trump's speech, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE blocked Qatari news sites, including al-Jazeera.

Everyone's getting a bit panicky. .""Like everything here, there's no warning. You learn to expect the unexpected!"" .Mr Doodson has booked a different flight to Oman, and says it will now take him two days to get to Australia. .As well as ceasing air contact, Saudi Arabia has closed its land borders with the tiny peninsula of Qatar. The move has prompted panic-buying in supermarkets, as about 40% of the desert nation's food is believed to be imported via the Saudi border. .The problem may be exacerbated by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, currently under way, when participants fast during daylight hours and eat only after nightfall. .Supermarket sales tend to spike as local outlets slash prices and offer special promotions. .Mr Doodson said friends have sent him pictures of empty supermarket shelves, while hurrying to stock up on meat and other staples. .The local Doha News website told a similar story: ""Customers could be seen piling their carts high with supplies of milk, water, rice and eggs at several popular grocery stores today, which were even busier than is usual for Ramadan."" .The outlet quoted a shopper at Carrefour in Villaggio Mall, Doha, saying: ""I've never seen anything like it - people have trolleys full of food and water."" .A statement from Qatar's government said that ""marine and air spaces will remain open for import and movement"", and urged shoppers not to worry. .It added that food in Qatar is sourced from around the world, not just the Gulf. .Ron Moonsinghe, who works as a teacher in the UAE, told the BBC he and his wife had booked flights home to the UK via Doha, with Qatar Airways.

Both carriers operate four daily return flights to Doha. .Budget carriers FlyDubai and Air Arabia are also cancelling routes to Doha, with other airlines, including Bahrain's Gulf Air and Egyptair expected to follow suit. .It comes after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt all said they would stop flights in and out of Qatar, and close their airspace to the country's airline, Qatar Airways. .And it is Qatar's flag carrier that risks being the biggest loser. Its flights to places like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Cairo will stop. That is dozens of flights a day. .Qatar Airways passengers in Abu Dhabi vent frustration .Qatar Airways has already said it is cancelling its services to Saudi. It said: ""All customers booked on affected flights to and from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be provided with alternative options, including the option of a full refund on any unused tickets and free rebooking to the nearest alternative Qatar Airways network destination."" .But being banned from large chunks of airspace in the region would also cause a major problem, forcing it to alter flight paths, inevitably adding time to some flights. .And as well as cranking up fuel bills, that could annoy passengers. .Qatar Airways' growth has come through positioning itself as a hub airline, connecting Asia and Europe via Doha. .""If a journey to Europe that used to take six hours now takes eight or nine because it has had to change routes, then that makes it far less appealing and passengers might look elsewhere,"" says Ghanem Nuseibeh, director at advisory firm Cornerstone Global. .British Airways is one of a number of European airlines to fly to Doha. It said on Monday that it will ""continue to offer a full schedule. .Desert states, by their nature, struggle to grow food. And food security is a particular issue for Qatar given the only way in by land is a single border with Saudi Arabia. .Every day hundreds of lorries cross the border, and food is one of the main supplies. About 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come via this route. .Saudi Arabia has said it will close that border and when the lorries stop, Qatar will become reliant on air and sea freight. .""It will immediately cause inflation and that will directly affect normal Qatari people,"" says Mr Nuseibeh. .""If things start costing significantly more, then you're going to see the Qatari people putting increasing political pressure on the ruling family for either a change of leadership or a change of direction."" .He also points out that many poorer Qataris make daily or weekly trips to Saudi to do their grocery shopping as it is cheaper. Clearly a closed border means this will no longer be possible. .A new port, a medical zone, a metro project and eight stadiums for the 2022 World Cup are just some of the major construction projects going on in Qatar right now. .Key materials, including concrete and steel come in by ship but also by land from neighbouring Saudi. .The closure of that border could, as with food - push up prices and lead to delays. .A materials shortage is already a threat that looms over Qatar's construction industry. This risks making things worse. .A lengthy closure of the airspace and land borders would ""wreak havoc on the timeline and delivery"" of the World Cup, says Kristian Ulrichsen, a Gulf expert at the US-based Baker Institute. .The move to end ties bans citizens from Saudi, Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Libya and Yemen from travelling to Qatar, living there or passing through it, according to the Saudi government. People affected have 14 days to leave. .Meanwhile Qataris will have the same amount of time to get out of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. .More significant though would be if Egypt issued a similar ban. According to one recent report about 180,000 Egyptians live in Qatar - with many involved in engineering, medicine and law as well as construction. .A loss of that workforce would pose a problem for both local and international firms operating in the Gulf state. .Nervousness over the unprecedented situation left Qatar's main share index more than 7% lower on Monday amid worries about the investment climate. .Many Gulf firms have a presence in Qatar, including in retail. Those stores are likely to to close, at least temporarily, believes Mr Nuseibeh. .Indeed, we're already seeing business deals begin to crumble - major Saudi football team Al-Ahli has cancelled a sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways. .Qatar isolated by its neighbours .What's behind crisis with Qatar?",413
414,35,5 June 2017,Qatar row: What's caused the fall-out between Gulf neighbours?," .On Monday 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, the UAE, and the internationally recognised Yemeni government severed their diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. .In addition, the states announced that they were suspending air, sea, and land transport with Qatar, while Qatari citizens are required to return home within two weeks. .Qatar's support of the Saudi and UAE-led operations in Yemen is also suspended. .This might seem familiar. These states (aside from Yemen) withdrew their diplomats from Doha in 2014 over a similar set of concerns. That spat was resolved within nine months. But the core issues remain. .On this occasion, though similar motives fuel the dispute, the fact that Qatar's land border with Saudi Arabia - its only land crossing - will be suspended shows a severe escalation, given just how critical this border is for Qatar's imports, including food. .Reports emerged in late May 2017 of a speech given by the Qatari Emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, where he was purported to have criticised America, offered support for Iran, reaffirmed Qatar's support for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and said that Qatar's relations with Israel were ""good"". .Qatar's official news agency then also reported that Qatar was withdrawing its ambassadors from Saudi, Bahrain, Egypt, and the UAE after discovering a ""conspiracy"" against Qatar. Subsequently, Qatari officials furiously denied that there was any truth behind these reports, but the damage was done. .The key problem was that these comments simply voiced out loud what many have long understood as Qatar's true policy positions. .Qatar has long had a tense relationship with the US. On a military-to-military level, the two countries co-operate well generally. But the US has long been angered by what it sees as slanted coverage in the Middle East by Qatar-owned Al Jazeera, Qatar's apparent support for a range of Islamist groups around the region, and lax anti-terrorist financing laws. .Similarly, Qatar has been bold in its support of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood. In May 2017, Qatar used its influence to push Hamas to issue a policy document seen by some as an attempt to soften its extremist image. .But support for Hamas places Qatar deeply at odds with many states, such as the US, who view Hamas as a terrorist organization. And the other Gulf monarchies prefer to deal with its secular rival Fatah as representatives for the Palestinians. .But the problem is that Qatar is just too bold, too often. .The core issue presently is Qatar's support of Islamists around the Middle East region, which emerged quite evidently during the Arab Spring. This is as much a result of the personalised politics of Qatar's foreign policy and elite bureaucracy as it is an active decision by Qatar to support Islamists. .Moreover, Qatar argues vociferously that it does not support Islamists because the state prefers to, but because such groups like the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood enjoy significant public support. .Either way, the UAE in particular, but also Saudi Arabia, do not agree at all with this approach of emboldening Islamist groups around the region. They tried to get Qatar to stop doing this in 2014, but, a few concessions aside, the broad tenor of Qatar's foreign policy approach did not change. .Otherwise, particularly under the leadership of the former Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, Qatar sought to carve out a unique niche for itself and its policies, such as augmenting relations with Israel or Iran, and rejecting the wider consensus of the regional group of the monarchies, the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). .Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Doha from 2002 to 2008 to try to pressure Qatar to curb its individualistic tendencies. This approach broadly failed too. .Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the leaders of this current move, will not want to fail again. And their position is strong, while Qatar's is weak. .Saudi Arabia and the UAE are emboldened. Leading the intervention in Yemen in 2015 displayed a newfound desire to truly lead on matters of regional security. And the UAE has, not least with a decade's operations alongside Isaf forces in Afghanistan, forged a reputation for itself as one of the US's most reliable Arab partners. .Then President Trump unprecedentedly took his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, and signed the largest weapons deal in history. .The only real card that Qatar holds with Washington is that it has, since the early 1990s, hosted a critical US base at al-Udeid. But this may no longer be enough. Other Gulf states may stand ready to replace this key base, though the logistics of this would not be straightforward. .The argument to President Trump may be compelling: with US help, Qatar might be persuaded to evict Hamas leadership from Doha and genuinely cut back on funding Islamist groups. .It seems that the time of Qatar's individualistic foreign policy may be up. .Dr David Roberts is a lecturer in the Defence Studies Department at King's College London.

417,38,20 May 2017,"The Qatari princess, Angelina Jolie and the battle of the pyramids"," .Reports that Hollywood star Angeline Jolie is planning to make a movie about Sudan's history have sparked a row with Egypt, and BBC Africa's Mohanad Hashim says it is about much more than who has the biggest pyramids. .The latest twist in a long-running feud between Egyptians and Sudanese is over controversial claims that a film is to be made in Sudan to showcase the country's contribution to human civilization. .Various media have reported that a Qatari production company would fund the film, which would apparently feature Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Leonardo Di Caprio. .It is meant to promote historical tourism in Sudan by narrating the country's ancient Nubian history. .The claims were so widespread that even the British ambassador to Sudan was caught up in the fray, tweeting on the story: .Sudanese tweeters published memes showing Jolie depicted as a Nubian queen and shared reports of press conferences confirming the Hollywood star and UN ambassador would visit the country in May to scout the film's locations. .An Egyptian TV channel even interviewed Sudanese designer Samar Darwish who was reported to be the costume designer for Jolie. .However, none of this has been confirmed. .The row kicked off in March, when the wife of the former Qatari Emir, Princess Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, visited Sudan as a United Nations ambassador. .Photos of Sheikha Moza's visit to the al-Bajrawyah pyramids, a site that houses several Meroitic pyramids that date from 320 BC - 50 AD, were widely publicised by Qatari-owned Pan-Arab networks. The pictures were widely circulated on social media too. .But across Egypt's TV networks, the visit was ridiculed and criticised. .Qatar's move to invest $135m (£100m) in projects to develop Sudan's archaeological sites is seen by many in Cairo as an attempt to undermine the struggling tourism sector in Egypt and part of ongoing efforts by the Gulf emirate to discredit Egypt and its leadership. .Reacting to the pictures of the princess by the Sudanese pyramids, Azmi Mujahid, a talk-show host on Egyptian Al-Assema TV mocked the Sudanese pyramids. .""All the world's stars have had their pictures taken by the [Giza] Pyramid but Sheikha Moza had a picture next to two [cheese triangles] in Sudan,"" he said. .The barrage of ridicule aimed at the size of the Sudanese pyramids made the Sudanese minister of information weigh in. .Ahmed Osman said: ""Sudan's pyramids were older than Egypt's by 2,000 years"", a claim disputed by archaeologists. .Other Sudanese were quick to point out that their country has a much larger collection of pyramids - 230 in total. .Egyptians have always prided themselves in claiming that ""Egypt is the mother of the world"". .Any visitor to Egypt would recognize the claim made and perpetuated by the official and popular narrative that Egypt is a ""7,000-year-old civilization"". .This is why a hand-written note written by the Qatari princess that Sudan was the ""mother of the world"" fell foul of Egyptian commentators and social media users. .This war of words between the two neighbours shows increasing tension over conflicting positions on issues such as: .Recently, President Omar al-Bashir accused Egypt of ""stabbing his country in the back when it occupied"" Sudanese territory in the mid-1990s. .He was referring to the disputed Halayib triangle, a coastal area on the Red Sea between Sudan and Egypt, which both countries claim. .After the row sparked by Sheikha Moza's visit, many Facebook pages sprang up in Sudan, calling for a boycott of Egyptian products, especially fruit and vegetables, claiming they were contaminated by raw sewage. .Since March, the Sudanese ministry of trade has suspended imports of several items, including ketchup, tomato and fish. .Khartoum's measures follow similar measures taken in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. .Some in Sudan have called for travel restrictions to be imposed on Egyptians. .Although officials from both countries have downplayed the row in public and emphasised the historic ties between the two peoples, Sudan has imposed visa fees on Egyptian men. .Cairo is nervous about Khartoum's position on various issues. .First is Sudan's close ties with Ethiopia, where the newly constructed Millennium Dam could reduce Egypt's share of the Nile waters, which Egypt's rulers have long considered its biggest existential threat. .The second matter is Sudan's ties with Egyptian Islamists and their Qatari backers. .Qatar backs Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi after he deposed the Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi as president in 2013. .Egyptians often depict Sudan as Egypt's southern province, with Egyptians often recounting that both countries were one during the British colonial presence in the Nile Valley. .Sudanese have long complained about racist sentiments displayed by Egyptian commentators ridiculing their country and government. .One reaction to the ongoing row has been the launching of the hashtag #KnowSudan and its Arabic translation in an effort by the Sudanese to raise awareness of their country and its heritage. .Sudanese quest for an African identity .Sudan's youth use poetry to fight censorship",417

They are expected to grow further as Welsh businesses attempt to find new markets outside the European Union. .But Doha airport already attracts much more business than just from those visiting Qatar. .The state airline is a growing hub for the region and further east. Welsh exports to that wider area are significant. In 2016, businesses sold goods and services worth £281m to the Middle East and North Africa and worth more than £1bn to Asia and Oceania. .It is not just about business. Tourism to Doha itself is rising - it grew by 11.5% between 2010 and 2015 and will be under the spotlight as it prepares to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022. .Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh Government in 2013 for £52m following a slump in passenger numbers. .But it has ambitious targets of reaching three million passengers a year and a replacement terminal in the long term. .Roger Lewis, Cardiff Airport chairman, called the Qatar Airlines tie-up a ""game changing announcement"" for the airport and for Wales. .""The benefits of this relationship will be transformational for both businesses and passengers across the south west of England and for Wales,"" he added. .First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will be in Qatar next weekend to discuss potential investment opportunities, added: ""This new route, and the relationship between Cardiff Airport and Qatar Airways, will open-up Wales' links with the rest of the world and deliver new economic, leisure and travel opportunities for Welsh businesses and the people of Wales."" .Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, who recently met senior managers at Qatar Airways to make the case for a service from Wales, added: ""This new route will send a positive message about an outward looking Wales developing international trade and tourism links to the rest of the world."" .Qatar Airlines' flights to Cardiff are among 12 new destinations for the airline, including San Francisco, Kiev and Lisbon, which were announced at a travel show in Dubai. .New terminal plan for Cardiff Airport .Grayling: Cardiff Airport great success .Cardiff Airport 'can complement Heathrow'",419

State media later confirmed that they had landed in Doha. .The group was seized in December 2015 while on a licensed hunting trip near the border with Saudi Arabia. .The hostages were abducted when gunmen swept into their camp at dawn in four-by-four vehicles. .The hunting party is widely believed to include one or several more prominent members of the Qatari royal family, although they have not been identified. .They were hunting the Asian houbara bustard, akin to a small turkey, using falcons trained to home in on their quarry. .Their release is said to be connected to a complex deal in Syria involving the evacuation of four besieged towns, which was announced earlier this week. .However, the interior ministry has not provided details confirming this. .The Guardian newspaper has reported that an Iraqi militia with strong ties to Iran, a key backer of the Syrian government and its ally Hezbollah, was holding the Qatari hunters. .It says the deal involves the Syrian Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham, Iran, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Qatar. .A Qatari royal and a Pakistani man were freed earlier this month. .Also on Friday, a spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham told Reuters that the Syrian government was going to release 500 prisoners into rebel-held territory, as part of a swap deal. .It is an agreement to end the sieges of four towns - two surrounded by pro-government forces, two by rebel and Islamist fighters - in eastern Syria. .Foah and Kefraya are mainly Shia Muslim, government-held towns, close to the border with Lebanon, which have been besieged since March 2015. .Madaya and Zabadani are rebel-held towns in the north-east, which have been besieged since June 2015 by the Syrian army and fighters from Lebanon's Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement. .Conditions have been desperate, especially in Madaya and Zabadani, with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel. International aid deliveries have been infrequent and required careful negotiation. Government air drops have eased the situation in Foah and Kefraya somewhat. .Under the exchange deal, residents of Foah and Kefraya are being bussed to government-held Aleppo, while people in Madaya and Zabadani are being taken to rebel-held areas. .The evacuations began last week, but were held up after a bomb attack hit the convoy of buses from the two government-held towns, killing at least 126 people including 68 children. .Thousands of evacuees from Foah and Kefraya have also been held up at a staging point for 48 hours, but a rebel involved in the operation told AFP that the buses had left after the news of the release of government-held prisoners. .According to AFP, the current phase of evacuations involves 8,000 people from Foah and Kafraya, and 2,500 civilians and rebels from Madaya and Zabadani. .A second phase is to begin in June. .Syria blast 'killed at least 68 children' .Qatari hunters kidnapped in Iraq .Birds of prey take flight - on Airbus .Pakistan seizes 'royal' falcons",420
