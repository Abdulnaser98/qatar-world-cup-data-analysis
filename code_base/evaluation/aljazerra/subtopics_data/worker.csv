On Sunday, that truism came alive in the heart of Buenos Aires. .It was visible on the faces of the young men and women whooping from atop traffic lights, in dancing little girls with the nation’s flags painted on their cheeks, and in elderly men fighting back tears. In the embraces between strangers. The anthems that hovered over the city. The simultaneous pulsating of a sea of people to the drums of victory. .Football is hope, and hope is contagious. .Argentina’s hard-fought World Cup win over France in Qatar has triggered an outpouring of emotions in the South American country. Joy and relief are competing with deep gratitude to the national team led by Lionel Messi who was finally able to hoist the one coveted trophy that had eluded him. It was Argentina’s first World Cup victory since 1986 when Diego Maradona led the country to glory. .“Bien, Argentina, bien,” one man said quietly to himself, as he looked around at the throngs descending on the Obelisco de Buenos Aires – the capital’s iconic landmark – to celebrate the victory. .“It really is a sensation like no other,” said Marilé Oviedo, 32. “It’s happiness. That’s what it is.” .Tens of thousands of people flowed through the arteries of the nation’s capital towards the obelisk, chanting, singing, jumping and dancing under giant flags stretched across the width of entire avenues. .Anthems reverberated off the ornate balconies of Sante Fe Avenue, paying homage to Messi and the spirit of Maradona – who passed away two years ago – who many believe was looking down upon them today. .“Soy Argentino! Es un sentimiento que no puedo parar!” they sang. “I’m Argentinian! It’s a feeling I can’t contain.” .The World Cup final was as dramatic as they come. Argentina dominated play for most of the regulation 90 minutes, until French phenom Kylian Mbappé sunk two goals within a minute to draw his side level. A thrilling period of extra time followed, in which each side managed to score a goal, leading to the excruciating penalty kicks and the brilliance of Argentina keeper Emiliano “Dibu” Martinez in stopping two shots. .Messi had said before the tournament that this would be his last World Cup, although after this victory he told an Argentinian media outlet that he wasn’t done with the national squad just yet. .The victory set off a wave of euphoria across Argentina, where people have been struggling with an economic crisis and inflation at nearly 100 percent this year. The World Cup was, for many, a necessary reprieve from an otherwise brutal 2022 that had left people disillusioned and exhausted. .Near the obelisk, people climbed on top of bus shelters, scaled the foliage of a giant BA sign, set off firecrackers and sung the de facto Argentina World Cup anthem, Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar (Boys, now we’re excited again) on loop. .The phrase “World Champions” was projected on the obelisk, and a giant banner in the form of a jersey was unfurled down the resplendent Teatro Colón opera house. In Messi’s hometown of Rosario, neighbours gathered around his childhood home with flags and horns. .President Alberto Fernandez said he had no words to describe the moment, except to say, on Twitter: “Always together, always united”. .The team was also congratulated by leaders around the world on Twitter. “Your joy crosses the Andes,” wrote Chilean President Gabriel Boric. “This will be remembered as one of the most thrilling football matches!”  tweeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. .The team will return to Buenos Aires on Monday, where crowds are expected to gather again to welcome their heroes – much like they did when the team won the Copa America tournament last year. .Arrangements are under way for official celebrations although local media are reporting that the team will avoid the obelisk and the presidential palace out of safety concerns because of the sheer number of people who will likely want to join in. .“We’re seeing an incredible effervescence, a display of pure joy,” said Mario Guarella, 80, who came out of his apartment on Santa Fe Avenue to get closer to the thousands of people marching to the obelisk. “It’s the culmination of all that sacrifice and effort.” .His eyes welled up with tears, talking about what it meant to his country to have won the trophy. “I’m feeling unity that I hope can serve to end the divide in our society,” he said. “The light blue and white is bringing us together, like it always has.” .María José Zeni, 43, with her toy poodle Carlitos in her arms, said she cried for almost the entire game. “We always have to suffer in order to enjoy it even more,” she said, standing on Santa Fe Avenue. “I’m happy for Messi, for the team, and for all Argentinians. We always have to struggle for things. Finally, this is some joy.” .Rodrigo Ronchetti, 40, was out with his family, marvelling at the endless stream of people hoping to get to the obelisk. He was quite certain his family wouldn’t make it there – crowds had started gathering the previous night in anticipation. .In a stroller, his daughter Amanda, not even a year old, squirmed in her Argentina jersey onesie. “Best day of her life,” he said, smiling. .Though Messi said he isn’t done playing for the national side, there is a sense among many Argentinians that the end of an era is near. .“I don’t know if we’re ever going to see someone like that again,” said Rubén Barrionuevo, 42, watching from the sidelines in Buenos Aires. He took comfort in the fact that the next generation is in the wings. .“There are lots of kids on the little neighbourhood pitches that play really well. One day, someone is going to come out of there.”"

They always make us suffer.” .France had reduced many Argentinian fans to a bundle of nerves at multiple points throughout the game. .At the end of the first half, many were gearing up to celebrate as Argentina led France 2-0 and clearly dominated the match. .But that early happiness turned to anxiety as France caught up, with Kylian Mbappe scoring three times to erase the comfortable lead that Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria had given La Albiceleste. The final score after extra time ultimately saw both teams tied at 3-3. .In the end, Argentina managed to pull out a 4-2 victory on penalties, a nail-biting affair that will surely be cemented in history as one of the most thrilling finals on record. .“I can’t believe it! It was difficult, but we did it, thanks to Messi,” Santiago, 13, who celebrated the win with his family in Buenos Aires, told Reuters. .The World Cup victory comes to a nation battered by an economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation, pushing many to the brink financially and much of the population into poverty. .“It was an incredible game, at times anguishing,” said 46-year-old Diego Aburgeily, who celebrated the win in the Buenos Aires suburbs. .“This team made people fall in love with them for the first time in decades.” .The last time Argentina made a World Cup finals appearance was in a losing effort to Germany in 2014. .When Argentina’s Gonzalo Montiel buried their fourth – and winning – penalty in the back of the French net, fans screamed, threw their hands in the air and hugged. .“It is an immense joy after so much tension,” lawyer Nicolas Piry, 46, said. .For some, Messi’s World Cup victory will put to rest one of the most hotly contested debates in football – who’s better: Messi or Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo? .Ronaldo, for all his accolades, has never won a World Cup – and he exited the tournament in Qatar after his team suffered a devastating semifinal loss to Morocco. .Messi may not play in the 2026 World Cup, but the 35-year-old said he also won’t immediately retire from the Argentinian national team."

That was thanks to three breathtaking goals from France’s Kylian Mbappe, who almost singlehandedly staged his side’s unthinkable comeback. .The drama of the match had left French fans sitting on the edge of their seats. .“To come back from a two-goal deficit is incredible,” said Romain Balthazar, a 22-year-old engineering student who visited Paris with friends to watch the final. “We came to experience this on the Champs — it’s fabulous.” .Just once has a team ever come back from two goals down in the World Cup final, and that was West Germany’s 3-2 win over Hungary in 1954, which remains the only time a team has overcome such a deficit in the tournament final. .France fans will take solace though in the awe-inspiring performance by Mbappe, who slid past Lionel Messi to earn the well-deserved Golden Boot trophy on Sunday as the World Cup’s top player. He netted eight goals over the course of the 2022 tournament. .French President Emmanuel Macron, who had travelled to Doha for the second time in a week to support Les Bleus, said he, too, was “very sad and disappointed”. .Macron had consoled and addressed the distraught team in the locker room after the game. . .“Les Bleus made us dream,” Macron tweeted after the match. .Disturbances were reported in Paris as dejected fans clashed with some of the approximately 14,000 riot police deployed across the country for the final. Minor skirmishes were also reported last week when police fired tear gas in the aftermath of France’s semifinal win over Morocco. . .Meanwhile, Argentina supporters in Paris gathered at the country’s embassy, located a short walk from the city’s iconic Arc de Triomphe monument. .“It’s an incredible feeling, with this finale for Messi, because we haven’t won since Maradona,” said 30-year-old Argentinian expat Alejandro Gomez. .In the southern city of Marseille, fans in the historic port district were also left reeling after the match. .“They played incredibly well, and didn’t disappoint, but penalty shots are always like Russian roulette,” said Laurent Bergerot, a 44-year-old engineer. .“It came down to chance but we fought until the end.” .In Bordeaux, Anthony Brebis, wearing a French flag on his shoulders matched by red, white and blue paint on his face, made a harsh assessment of the national side: “We have a young team that didn’t have enough experience to hold out for more than 90 minutes.” .French fans in search of redemption will now have to wait for UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany, the next big tournament in which Les Bleus will compete."

Aires to ‘Barwargento’,The Barahat Al Janoub apartment complex was renamed ‘Barwargento’ by Argentinian supporters who have brought a touch of home to Qatar.,".Al Wakrah, Qatar – The enticing smell of chargrilled meat fills the air, Argentinian music blares from portable speakers and a game of cards ends with high-fives and smiles. .This is a routine sight at the sprawling apartment complex in Al Wakrah City, southeast of Doha, that Argentinian football fans have turned into a little piece of home. .Barahat Al Janoub, or Barwargento as its current occupants call it, may be more than 13,000km (8,078 miles) from Buenos Aires or Rosario but fans who live here have not let distance get in the way of their pre-match customs and extended post-match celebrations – of which there have been many for Argentina’s supporters. .The biggest was after Argentina’s semifinal win over Croatia. . .Mattias, who arrived in Qatar from Argentina at the beginning of the World Cup, said he kept singing and dancing until the early hours of the following morning because it was a “once-in-a-lifetime moment” for him. .“We don’t know if we will watch Argentina play another World Cup final so we wanted to make the most of the occasion and celebrate until we collapsed,” he told Al Jazeera outside his apartment in Barwargento. .Videos posted on social media showed a fan playing music from his electric keyboard as dozens gathered around him to sing some of their most famous football songs and shake their arms in the signature rhythmic back-and-forth motion. .“The culture of singing songs before and after matches originates from club football in Argentina and we just change the lyrics of the songs to suit the national team and players,” Mattias explained. .Music is not the only part of Argentinian culture the fans have brought with them to Qatar. Pre-match singing and post-match celebrations are always paired with a group barbecue because all the singing and jumping require energy, Mattias says. .Be it some chicken and vegetables cooked by a few friends, or whole lambs shared among large groups, some kind of grilling has to be done to complete the list of Argentinian match-day rituals. .Tatiana Quartucci, who travelled to Qatar from Rosario, said barbecues go along with every special occasion back in Argentina. And no occasion can be more momentous than a World Cup final. .“On Sunday, we will all dress up in our Argentina shirts, gather in the centre and have a big barbecue to last us until the end of the match,” Quartucci said. .Free shuttle buses arranged by tournament organisers will transport the fans to Lusail Stadium. If videos posted before Argentina’s earlier knockout games are anything to go by, the buses will shake with the ferocity of singing and dancing fans all along the 45km (28 miles) journey. .“We start singing before boarding the buses and don’t stop until we reach the stadium,” Mattias said, adding that the singing resumes inside the stadium before and carries on in Barwargento until after sunrise. .According to the Argentinian embassy in Doha, at least 35,000 Albiceleste fans have made the long journey to Qatar. While some left after the first few matches, most stayed to rally around their team in the knockout stages. .Argentinian flags hang from balconies, lamp posts and even large rubbish bins in every corner of the Barwargento apartment complex. Some of these flags have images of Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi printed on them, while others simply indicate which part of Argentina the fans have come from. .“We have brought our towns, villages and football clubs with us to show that all of Argentina is behind the team,” Mauricio, a fan who travelled from Argentina’s southernmost city of Ushuaia, said while holding up his island’s flag. .Mattias, who comes from Rosario, admitted that nerves will start jangling once the countdown to the final approaches but it will not stop him from belting out “Vamos Argentina” at the top of his lungs as he boards the bus on Sunday afternoon. .“We are here in big numbers and we are here to win the World Cup,” he said with a raised fist. .While brightly-coloured buses in tournament livery will transport the fans, they’re hope “La Scaloneta” will take Lionel Messi and his team to the promised land. .In recent years, under the leadership of coach Lionel Scaloni, the Argentinians got a new nickname – La Scaloneta, a combination of “Scaloni” with the word for van or bus (camioneta) “the Scaloni Bus”, or the bus driven by Scaloni. .Barwargento has its own La Scaloneta – a small white van with images of Diego Maradona and Messi on the back. A large Argentinian flag is draped over one corner while the front is painted in the blue and white of the country. .La Scaloneta, according to Mattias, represents the dream of millions of Argentinians. The driving force behind the dream is coach Lionel Scaloni. .“Scaloni has taken the team to unprecedented success since taking charge in 2018, and we are sure that he is the one who will drive us to glory,” he said."

major changes in Latin America, as 2022 brought elections, scandals and one major sports triumph. .Politically, a leftward swing has continued to shake up governments across the region, with some experts calling the trend a new “pink tide”. Colombia elected its first left-wing leader, and in neighbouring Brazil, former union leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva defeated far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro to become the country’s next president. .Meanwhile, myriad crises have continued, with Haiti falling further into insecurity, and El Salvador accused of widespread human rights abuses in its crackdown on deadly gang violence. .In the world of sport, there was at least one positive note to end the year, with Argentina winning the World Cup championship — marking the first time in 20 years that a Latin American team has brought home the trophy. .Here are the stories that defined 2022: .Lula beats Bolsonaro in Brazil’s presidential election .Hailed as his party’s “phoenix”, Lula saw a remarkable reversal of fortunes in 2022, securing a narrow victory in Brazil’s run-off election against current right-wing president Bolsonaro. .The election came just more than a year and a half after a Brazilian Supreme Court judge quashed all corruption convictions against Lula, who spent 580 days in prison. .The left-wing leader, who previously served as president from 2003 to 2011, promised to be an antidote to the Trumpian Bolsonaro, running on a platform of economic and social justice in response to widespread inequality and poverty in Brazil. .During a raucous reception at the United Nations COP27 climate conference in Egypt, Lula also pledged to reassert Brazil – home to large portions of the Amazon rainforest – as a global leader in environmentalism. He is set to be inaugurated on January 1. .Overlapping crises in Haiti have only worsened over the last year, with the country’s top diplomat to the US openly appealing for controversial foreign intervention. .Following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, armed gangs have taken control of large swathes of the country. .In November, Ulrika Richardson, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in the country, told reporters that gangs were using sexual violence to “instill fear and to punish and to terrorise the local populations”. She estimated that 60 percent of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince had fallen under gang domination. .The insecurity has crippled aid delivery to the country, where half the population faces acute food shortages, according to the World Food Programme, and where cholera cases have spiked at the year’s end. .It was the progressive overhaul that was not. .Championed by left-wing President Gabriel Boric, the proposed constitution would have replaced the current charter — adopted during the rule of military dictator Augusto Pinochet — with a document that places greater emphasis on social rights, the environment and gender equality. .But the new charter was soundly rejected by Chileans in September, with 61.9 percent voting against adoption and 38.1 percent voting in favour. .While many support the concept of a new constitution, critics said September’s proposal lacked a clear structure and overreached in key areas. In December, legislators from both the country’s left and right agreed to begin drafting another attempt. .A quicksilver series of events on December 7 saw Peru’s President Pedro Castillo attempt to dissolve Congress, get impeached and end up behind bars. .It all played out in just a few hours, capped by the swearing-in of Castillo’s former vice president, Dina Boluarte, to the top job. In the process, Boluarte became Peru’s first female president. .Unrest among Castillo’s supporters quickly grew, sparking protests, and clashes with police and military left over 20 people dead. .To diffuse the tension, Boluarte appealed to Peru’s Congress to move general elections up from 2026 to 2023. An initial attempt failed to gain enough votes in the legislature, but on December 20, the opposition-led Congress tentatively approved a constitutional reform that would make it possible to move the election forward. The plan must still be ratified by a two-thirds majority. .At least 15 media workers were killed in Mexico in 2022, according to an Associated Press tally, making it the deadliest year for journalists in three decades. .Mexico was second only to war-torn Ukraine in the number of journalists killed during the year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), with observers citing the prominence of criminal gangs, complicity of local officials, and government inaction for the rise. .The violence was punctuated in December by a brazen attack on Ciro Gomez Leyva, one of Mexico’s most prominent radio and television reporters, according to CPJ. He survived the Mexico City attack thanks to bulletproof armour on his vehicle. .“I’m Argentinian! It’s a feeling I can’t contain,” sang revellers in the country’s capital of Buenos Aires after the national team, led by superstar Lionel Messi, defeated France to win the World Cup, international football’s biggest event. .It was the first time since 1986 that Argentina took home the World Cup trophy — and the first time in decades that any Latin American team triumphed in the final. .Fans wearing the colours of Argentina’s blue-and-white flag descended upon Qatar, this year’s World Cup host, underscoring the team’s uniquely international reach. .But it came down to a nailbiter, with 23-year-old French striker Kylian Mbappe nearly swiping the championship with a Herculean hat trick in the waning minutes of the match. .With France and Argentina tied at three goals apiece, the tournament champion was crowned through penalty kicks. But the trophy ultimately came home to the house that Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona built. .A leftward trend across Latin America continued with the June presidential victory of Gustavo Petro in Colombia. .Petro, a former rebel fighter who ran on a platform of profound social and economic change, became the first left-wing president in a country that has long marginalised the left for its perceived association with years of armed conflict. .Meanwhile, Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, became the country’s first Afro-Colombian female vice president. .In early December, residents of Soyapango, a densely populated municipality on the outskirts of San Salvador, woke up to 10,000 police and military personnel on the streets. .It was the latest move in a controversial gang crackdown by president Nayib Bukele. In March, the government imposed a state of exception that suspended some civil liberties and led to the mass incarceration of nearly 60,000 Salvadorans. .Rights groups have documented an array of abuses since the crackdown began, including violations of due process, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and deaths in custody. .Shocking video captured a man pointing a gun at the head of Argentina’s Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner outside of her Buenos Aires home in September. .The attacker pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Fernandez de Kirchner, who was under investigation for corruption at the time, survived unscathed. The gunman, meanwhile, was arrested. .In early December, Fernandez de Kirchner was sentenced to six years in prison on charges that she fraudulently awarded public works contracts to a family friend in Patagonia, a stronghold for her political career. .She remains in office and has said she plans to appeal the conviction. .Panama’s National Migration Service said in October that 151,582 migrants and refugees had crossed the Darien Gap, an inhospitable stretch of mountainous jungle between Columbia and Panama, since January. .The number set a new record, surpassing the 133,726 crossings recorded in 2021, with the increase attributed to the economic fallout of COVID-19 and an uptick of people leaving Venezuela. .The 106km (66-mile) trek can take more than a week, with many bound for the US border. There, they often met with expulsion under Title 42, a policy invoked under former US President Donald Trump that allows border agents to turn away most people crossing the border as a COVID-19 prevention. .In mid-December, Title 42 was set to expire. But in response to a request from mainly Republican lawmakers, the US Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments over whether states can challenge ending the policy. It will remain in place until at least February, when the case is scheduled."

Having resided off and on in the coastal town of Zipolite in Mexico’s southern Oaxaca state since the start of the pandemic, I had already amassed a good quantity of Mexican football shirts, and I watched the games at a café on the beach, where a television had been set up on a table in the sand. .A traditional Mexican blanket was hung to deflect the glare of the sun, and an altar was erected below the TV comprising burning incense, a green candle bearing the image of Jesus Christ, an enlarged photograph of Mexican goalie Guillermo Ochoa, and assorted good luck charms. A small audience would gather with the beer the Mexican TV commentators in Qatar had encouraged us to imbibe on their behalf, and the 90 minutes would pass in animated camaraderie, with plenty of hollering and colourful Mexican swear words. .Little did we know that, upon the elimination of the Mexican team, Morocco would replace Mexico in our hearts – in my case rather literally. With the help of a laundry pin, a piece of paper, and red nail polish, I amended the MEXICO emblazoned across the chest of one of my jerseys. The letters OROC took the place of EXI, and I was ready to go. .The match viewings on the Zipolite beach became even livelier, and much beer was spilled as Morocco defeated Spain and then Portugal. The Moroccan team awakened feelings inside me I didn’t know I had – sentiments that under normal circumstances I would have resisted as unforgivably cheesy, but that I now fully embraced. I lived for Morocco – and, from my plastic chair on the sand, I squealed, yelped, convulsed, and dug my fingernails into the arm of the man next to me, in accordance with every development on the football field. .In a sport from which capitalism has done its best to purge any vestige of joy, Morocco had put the magic back in the game. By winning against former European colonisers, celebrating solidarity with Palestine, and generally emanating pure humanity, the Moroccan players made it clear that the 2022 World Cup was about something much more than scoring goals. And this, in turn, made us all feel like we were part of something much bigger than ourselves. .When Morocco lost to France on December 14, I commenced crying at minute 80 of the match and didn’t stop for two hours, as the defeat had apparently also triggered the release of all pent-up emotions for the year. With the World Cup officially over on December 18 and the Mexico-Morocco jersey retired to the heap of clothes on my couch, it was time to transition into Christmas mode – the problem being that nothing seemed very festive any more. .Until now, Christmas had always been an occasion of cosy nostalgia for me, despite my abandonment of religion decades ago when my Catholic middle school teacher in Texas informed me that my dog wasn’t going to heaven. This year, however, the holidays just weren’t cutting it in terms of warmth and fuzziness, as all the magic seemed to have been consumed by the World Cup. I placed a dilapidated lit-up Santa Claus in the middle of my kitchen counter in Zipolite in the hopes of provoking some sort of holiday spirit, but all I could think about was Morocco. .Call it the post-World Cup Christmas blues. .Of course, for many of the world’s World Cup enthusiasts, the comedown from the tournament entailed not so much a return to the tedium of daily existence as a return to daily torment. Consider Lebanon, which is currently contending with a full-blown economic apocalypse, a ruling elite hellbent on the destruction of everything minus their own power, and the perennial predations of neighbouring Israel – to list but a few aspects of the contemporary Lebanese predicament. .A Lebanese friend of mine in Beirut religiously followed the World Cup matches, some of them transmitted with a three-minute delay on account of Lebanon’s eternal technical difficulties. He reported that, following the final showdown between Argentina and France, people were “celebrating here like Lebanon won”, with convoys of vehicles waving Argentinian flags clogging the streets of the Lebanese capital. .Judging from past Lebanese reactions to international football outcomes, the same spectacle would have undoubtedly ensued no matter which country won the World Cup – just with different flags. Now, with the palliative of the beautiful game over for Lebanese football fans, it’s back to a reality of national self-combustion. .For Palestinians, too, football has been known to provide a welcome distraction from Israeli military persecution and butchery – except, obviously, when Israel does things like massacre Palestinian children playing football on the beach. This year in Qatar, the Moroccan team’s decision to place the Palestinian cause front and centre – in defiance of the Moroccan government’s own normalisation with Israel – bumped the World Cup up to a whole new level of special. .Meanwhile back in Mexico – where life for the average Mexican is hardly all fun and games, either – football offers many people a fleeting escape from a national landscape of US-inflicted neoliberal wreckage and a bloody US-sponsored “war on drugs” that amounts to a war on the poor. .And with the post-World Cup Christmas blues now upon us, we might take solace in the fact that we only have to wait 3.5 years for the next one – which, mercifully, will not take place right before Christmas. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

People held up banners of Messi and late icon Diego Maradona, played instruments or climbed lampposts or bus stops. .“It’s crazy, it’s incredible, it’s the best thing that can happen to you in life,” said Matias Gomez, 25, a metalworker. .“It is an enormous joy to see all these happy people, all together, one with the other, holding hands, giving each other hugs, kisses. We are all one today.” .The Argentinian capital has been in party mode since the dramatic victory over France in Sunday’s final in Qatar, which has helped mask economic woes in the South American nation battling one of the world’s highest inflation rates. .The victory, in a penalty shootout after a whipsaw game, made the country world champions for the first time since Diego Maradona hoisted the trophy in 1986 and the third in total. The government made Tuesday a national holiday to allow fans to celebrate the win. .The players, after spending a few hours at the Argentinian Football Association (AFA) facilities near the airport, left on an open-top bus with signs saying “World Champions” and three stars to mark the country’s trio of trophies. .The players danced and cheered with fans who circled the bus. Police were having to hold people back to allow the vehicle to move forward on its slow journey towards the centre of town. .Earlier Messi, 35, who has burnished his reputation as one of the world’s greatest players, sent out a message on Instagram saying “Good morning!” with a photo of him sleeping in his room at the AFA complex next to the golden trophy. .Messi has said the final, in which Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties after the scintillating extra time ended with 3-3, would be his last match in the World Cup, though he intends to play a few more games for the national side. .At times, it has felt that the whole country has been partying through the night from Sunday onwards in the southern hemisphere summer, the joy of victory infecting everyone with cars regularly blaring their horns in celebration."

Maradona’s second goal in that match is widely considered one of the greatest ever: He took possession of the ball in Argentina’s half, then dribbled past a series of England players and their goalkeeper to score, leaving opposition players on their knees or with hands on hips. .Many years later, Maradona termed the victory a “revenge” for the war in his autobiography, I am The Diego. .Matus, who attended the 1986 World Cup as a 19-year-old, said Maradona did more than just win a trophy for the country. “I saw him weave his magic on the pitch, but his real power was in uniting the nation after the [Falklands] war,” Matus said with a quivering voice. .According to Matus, Maradona was a leader of the entire nation and united all Argentinians after years of economic struggle, military dictatorship and societal discord. .“He invoked a sense of pride in being Argentinian that we had forgotten, and he is the reason this blue and white shirt became so popular,” Matus said while pointing to a sea of Argentine shirts in the crowd in front of him. .For most fans who have travelled to Qatar, the love and reverence for Maradona have been passed on from the previous generations. .Mauro, who has travelled from Cordoba in central Argentina, has been wearing a worn-out Maradona shirt to every match in Qatar. “My father bought it during the 1986 World Cup and passed it on to me,” he said. “Along with the shirt, my father passed on his love for Diego and taught me that Maradona fought for all the unfortunate people in the world.” .Every time fans make their way to an Argentina match, Maradona’s name is on their lips when they sing their football anthems, his face is emblazoned on their banners, and his number is printed on their shirts. .“He’s in our hearts, our soul, our blood,” Matus said while patting his chest, and added: “Maradona is Argentina, and Argentina is Maradona.”"

If the Albiceleste end up beating France in the World Cup final in Qatar on Sunday, tens of thousands of Argentines will flood the Avenida 9 de Julio – where the monument sits – as is the tradition, dancing to bongos, car horns and anthems they have been belting out for weeks. .“We’re here because Argentina is going to win,” said a confident Iglesias, 46, holding her infant daughter, also dressed in Messi gear. “We know that it’s going to be a huge party.” .Argentina has been vibrating with this kind of energy ever since it beat Croatia in the semifinal last week and earned a berth in the final at Lusail Stadium against Les Bleus, as the French side are known. .Few places on earth are as fixated on football as this country of 47 million people. The sport is part of its cultural identity: It’s a calling card around the globe; a way to measure greatness in the midst of chronic economic crisis; a fountain of joy and talent. .Jose Alberto, Iglesias’ son who is only two World Cups old himself, already knows how much the tournament means. One World Cup ends and the countdown to the next one begins, he said, standing in front of the obelisk. .Argentinian fans have had high expectations for the team led by superstar Messi, himself chasing the one trophy that has eluded him throughout his illustrious career. After a shocking opening loss to Saudi Arabia, the maestro went back to conducting a symphony on the pitch. And with every victory, every step closer to the goal, the crowd at home revelled in the splendour they saw on television – and for those who went to Qatar, in the flesh. .Now, hours away from the final match, the excitement and tension are at a fever pitch. .“Maradona, Maradona, Maradona sells,” said a merchant on Corrientes Avenue, the city’s theatre district, hawking jerseys that seem to be in endless supply. “If you’re younger, you look for Messi,” she added, or Julian Alvarez, the 22-year-old striker who emerged as a star during the tournament with four goals so far. .“That passion, that communion, that thing of celebrating the goal with the person that you have beside you, even though you don’t know who they are, or what they think, or where they come from,” said Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta. “We’re all together behind the same passion.” .A grandmother who joined in raucous celebrations in a suburb of Buenos Aires has become an online celebrity, dubbed “Abuela lalalala”; while a still from video of Messi calling a Dutch player “fool” after the tense quarterfinal against the Netherlands soon graced t-shirts sold at street corners. .On the streets, the enthusiasm is infectious, with people singing Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar (Guys, we’re excited again) a catchy song by La Mosca Tsé that has become the de facto Argentina World Cup anthem. .The city of Buenos Aires organised “banderazos” – events for people to cheer on the team, dance and wave their Argentina flags – at 15 points across the capital in the days before the final. The idea? Players more than 13,300km (8264 miles) away in Qatar should be able to hear the collective “scream” of the fans backing them. .The passion has also shows in superstitious rituals known as cabalas, in which people repeat a set of game-viewing behaviours that they’ve come to associate with victories. Fans have been watching games with the same people, sitting in the same seats, wearing the same clothes, and eating the same food – all meant to increase the chances of victory. .The World Cup has even summoned the sorcery of self-described witches in Argentina, who have banded together to use candles, orations and other rituals to send positive vibes in the direction of the team. They have also warned against practices that are meant to interfere with the French players, saying those could backfire on Argentina. .“It’s incredible to see what Argentina generates during the World Cup,” said Miguel Angel Bogado Gomez, who was selling World Cup souvenirs next to the obelisk. “Even Brazil, which has an incredibly high level of football, doesn’t end up doing what Argentina can on an international level with a ball and its jersey.” Even that hyperbole – Brazil have won five world Cups to Argentina’s two – only underscores the near-mythical status Argentina’s football players enjoy. .The 56-year-old craftsman, who sells his woodburning art, had a selection of Maradona- and Messi-themed art pieces. At his age, Gomez said, he has come to understand that “not everything turns out the way you want” but he’s so invested in this World Cup that the thought of having victory slip out of the team’s grasp filled him with anxiety. “At this time tomorrow, we could be champions,” he said. .Iglesias and Jose Alberto are convinced too. She described the World Cup as a “joyful” month that “brings unity” that she has seen through the messages she exchanged with friends and family in other parts of Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where she is originally from. Support for the Argentina squad has spread across the region, with people in Chile, Colombia, and even Brazil – a football rival – pulling for the team that’s representing South America in the final. .“I’ve carried Argentina in my blood for a long time, since I was young in Venezuela, and my dream of coming to live here came true,” she said. “The faith I’ve had with football, I’ve always had with Messi.” .For Elias Draganczuk, 38, the World Cup has been a distraction for a country ravaged by high inflation and seemingly endless economic gloom. “This is the opium of the village,” he said, looking out from a shaded perch near the obelisk. “Every four years to spend millions and millions on this when this is a country that doesn’t have potable water [in some parts],” he said, shaking his head. .Even though he hasn’t surrendered to football fever, he knows where his allegiance lies. “I’m Argentinian,” he said with a laugh. “Obviously I want them to win.”"

A shock in the opening game against Saudi Arabia sent fans, who had been betting on some joy amid economic turmoil at home, reeling. .The spirits are higher again, however, as the side has shown progressively stronger performances, with flashes of brilliance from Messi and his teammates. .“Nervous” is how Matias, 15, one of the boys playing in the gym at Eros, summed up his feelings. .“I feel like Argentina can get to the final. I won’t say win it all, because I don’t want to jinx it, but we can get there,” he said. .It is difficult to overstate how big football is in Argentina. A pastime enmeshed so closely with national identity, the glory days of Maradona are a touchstone that no one will let go of. .Despite the painful inflationary crisis that has battered people’s wallets, Argentinians are among the highest ticket-purchasers for the tournament. Aerolineas Argentinas, the national carrier, launched a special flight to Qatar in time for the quarter-final which was sold out. .A livestream on Twitch by former footballer Sergio Aguero with Messi and other members of the team garnered 250,000 viewers. .“Whatever happens, for me you are all phenomenal people,” Aguero told the group. “Your victory always makes me very happy because it’s also mine.” .There is also the superstition that accompanies the World Cup. .Argentinians replicate behaviour that they come to associate with winning games. The boys at Eros all had theirs: Matias wears the same shorts and socks that he had during the wins. Santiago goes to the same restaurant and sits in the same chair with the same people for every game. .The World Cup is a unifying force in Argentina, Viviana Vila, a veteran sports journalist, said. .“It’s the only moment in which we are all brought to a standstill to live through the same emotion,” said Vila, who became the first Argentinian woman to do TV commentary during a World Cup in 2018. .“It might be joy, or it may be sadness. But for two or three hours, we will all live through the same emotion.” . .She added that the team has many things going for it beyond, of course, counting the best player in the world among its ranks. .“They are a group of players who are completely capable of facing these circumstances with a coaching team that is skilled, world class, young, and low profile.” .After their abysmal failure of the last World Cup in Russia, where Argentina lost to eventual winners France in the last 16, the momentum now is on Argentina’s side, she said. .“This is the best Messi,” she added. “The most mature. It’s a fantastic team. The truth is that you have to play each game. There’s not much more we can say about it.” .Back at Eros, a big Argentina flag drapes over the liquor cabinet in the clubhouse restaurant, as fans whir in the oppressive heat of December. .Murals of Maradona adorn the club’s 80-year-old façade. A crowd of locals that has gathered here to cheer at every Argentina match will be back again on Friday, said club member Marcelo Krimer, 39. .“Football represents everything that is good,” he said, noting that he means specifically the sport, not the national and international governing bodies that run it “like a mafia”. .At Eros, families find community and support. They often have to force people to leave at night by turning the lights off. .“This is gold for childhood,” said Krimer, looking around at the boys playing in the gym. “It helps us forget about everything. I always say that coming to the club, to this space, it’s like removing your brain and putting it in a bucket of ice,” he grinned. “Then you leave and return to your life, your family, your job.” .For Jorge del Rio, 70, the club is an oasis in a concrete jungle. He has run a football school for children at Eros for 30 years. In a city like Buenos Aires, “the potrero” – the Spanish word for pasture, or rural pitch – where people like Maradona cultivated their skills, has all but disappeared, he said. .“We used to play on the street, and a car would pass by every now and then,” he said. “You can’t do that any more.”"

you judge others.",".United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently came out against a ban on rainbow armbands at the World Cup tournament in Qatar, which various European team captains had intended to sport in support of LGBTQ rights and against discrimination. Blinken flagged the ban as “concerning” and a restriction on “freedom of expression”. .The secretary’s scolding came on the heels of another rather “concerning” development on the world stage: a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in the US state of Colorado that killed five people and wounded 18 others. This, in a country that fancies itself the global role model in terms of respect for freedom of expression, human rights, and all that good stuff – and yet where it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to exercise their right to not be massacred at nightclubs, elementary schools, places of worship, shopping malls, and so on. .In 2016, the US witnessed its worst mass shooting in history when 50 people were killed in an attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. .This year, an independent UN human rights expert found that LGBTQ rights in the US are “under a concerted attack” and being “deliberately undermined” by state governments. Add to this landscape the institutionalised racism and discrimination that constitutes “freedom” in the US, and it seems US officials might have slightly more pressing matters to attend to on the home front than World Cup armbands. .Indeed, as this year’s World Cup host, Qatar has come under intense US and European fire on the issue of gay rights as well as migrant worker exploitation (not to mention the violation of the apparent human right to drink beer in sports stadiums). After all, Orientalism dies hard – and what better backdrop for the release of pent-up Western chauvinism than a football tournament in a bona fide Middle Eastern desert, enduring Orientalist symbol of Arab backwardness and resistance to progress? .The point of calling out Western criticisms is not to contend, crassly, that the Gulf emirate is categorically beyond reproach. It is, rather, to highlight the massive hypocrisy that is on display when countries that continue to commit more human rights abuses than Qatar could ever dream of decide to unilaterally award themselves the moral high ground. .It’s kind of like when the US rails against oppressive government behaviour in Cuba. The critiques are not necessarily invalid in and of themselves, but they command zero moral traction given the US’s superior track record of oppression, including its barbarous 60-year embargo of the island and its operation of an illegal prison and torture centre on occupied Cuban territory in Guantánamo Bay. .As the old saying goes, look in the mirror before you judge others. .Navid Zarrinnal, a scholar of Iran and the Middle East at Stanford University in California, remarked in an email to me that “Western supremacist attitudes and cultural imperialism” are being showcased at the World Cup – “disguised”, as usual, as “advocacy for human rights”. This arrangement naturally makes it difficult for Western states and NGOs to “prioritise self-reflection over their saviour anxieties”. .The people who are “parachuting into Qatar to lecture them about gay rights”, Zarrinnal said, are ignorant of the long history of homosexuality in the Arab world, which is “reflected in their poetry, visual art, and social history”. He continued on to describe how Western powers, now with their footballers at the vanguard, have instead reduced the panorama to a simplistic narrative of repression – salvation from which depends entirely on whether Arab homosexuality can be “molded into the same LGBTQ identities they have in their own countries”. .On the eve of the World Cup kickoff, Gianni Infantino, the Italian president of FIFA, delivered a rambling speech, which – a couple of patronising detours into Orientalism notwithstanding – took some valid hits at Western hypocrisy: “I think for what we Europeans have been doing in the last 3,000 years, around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people”. .He also slammed the selective denunciation of migrant worker abuse in Qatar when Western firms had long been content to profit from labour conditions in the country – which he contended had improved considerably in the context of the World Cup – and when Europe’s own lethally xenophobic anti-migration policy is to blame for thousands upon thousands of refugee deaths in the Mediterranean Sea and beyond. (Of course, European racism and xenophobia can be selectively curtailed in the interest of football; there weren’t many Brits complaining when 21-year-old Nigerian British footballer Bukayo Saka scored two of the goals in England’s first World Cup match this year.) .As for what the US has been doing around the world for much less than 3,000 years, this includes killing Native Americans, enslaving Black people, and serving as the architect of a global capitalist system predicated on vast inequality, the mass trampling of rights, and the subjugation of workers. .Even as the US violates everyone else’s borders to sow military and economic havoc, it furiously fortifies its own – a practice that, as in Europe, has rendered US-bound migration a frequently deadly undertaking. Not that life is a peach for those who successfully cross the border, many of whom perform services crucial to the US economy and yet are drastically underpaid, demonised by society, and utilised as political scapegoats. .In other words, it’s all pretty “concerning”, to borrow Blinken’s term. Just as it’s concerning that a country that has bombed countless human beings to bits feels qualified to sermonise on any matter relating to human rights. .Writing recently at the Guardian, David Wearing – a University of Sussex lecturer and the author of AngloArabia: Why Gulf Wealth Matters to Britain – observes that much of the discourse surrounding the current World Cup is driven by “racist caricatures” pitting an enlightened West against an irreparably uncivilised Middle East. This “self-serving mythology”, Wearing notes, obscures regional history and legitimises Western interference (civilised bombing, anyone?) – it also “externalises and circumscribes the blame for human rights abuses… while preserving a narcissistic sense of western innocence”. .Wearing concludes that the 2022 World Cup, far from being a phenomenon “alien” to the West, is in fact a “representative example of the world that western power built”. And as concerned parties remain up in arms over the perceived contravention of Western values at the tournament, it’s high time to bust out that proverbial mirror. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

Gundogan also has a Turkish family background. He was subsequently jeered by German supporters during a World Cup warmup game. .The abuse of Ozil, in particular, increased after the tournament, helped by incendiary statements from Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff and the federation president at the time, Reinhard Grindel. .Grindel later said he should have given Ozil more support. .After playing in Sunday’s game at Al Bayt Stadium, in which Germany and Spain drew 1-1, Gundogan said he just wanted to focus on football from now on. .“Honestly, my point of view is: now the politics are finished,” Gundogan said. .“The country of Qatar is very proud to host the World Cup, also the first Muslim country, and I come from a Muslim family. So the Muslim community is proud. So I think now it’s just about football.”"

It does not fit in our times and it is not appropriate towards people,” Faeser said during a visit to a German Football Association event in Doha before the game. .Fans should also be allowed to “openly” show pro-LGBTQ symbols, Faeser told reporters, adding that supporters should “make a decision for themselves” about whether they wanted to wear them. .The criminalisation of same-sex relations in Qatar, the tournament’s host country, has been a long-running controversy in the build-up to the World Cup. .Qatar has repeatedly stated that everyone is welcome to attend the tournament. The government has also accused critics of “double standards” and of engaging in an “unprecedented campaign” unlike that faced by any other host country. .Moments after the team photo, the German Football Association tweeted it with the message: “It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. .“Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position.” . .German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said earlier in the day in Berlin that FIFA’s decision to bar captains from wearing the armbands was “very unfortunate”. .“The rights of LGBTQ people are non-negotiable,” Hebestreit told a press conference. .Security staff at the World Cup have ordered spectators to remove items of clothing featuring rainbow logos. .Underlining tensions at the tournament over the issue, Belgium player Jan Vertonghen said on Tuesday that he was “afraid” to talk about human rights. .Vertonghen, speaking on the eve of Belgium’s opening game against Canada later on Wednesday, said he did not feel comfortable. .“I’m afraid if I say something about this I might not be able to play tomorrow,” the defender said. .“It’s an experience I’ve never felt in football before. I feel controlled. I’m afraid to even say something about this. .“We’re just saying normal things about racism and discrimination and if you can’t even say things about it, that says it all. .“I want to appear on the pitch tomorrow, so I’ll leave it at that.”"

Leon, 62, and her husband, Tato Lenoce, 65, opened the bar a year and a half ago after being forced to close their previous bar during the pandemic because they were behind on their rent. .Today, it is in many ways a mirror to the brutal economic pain that millions of people in Argentina have endured over the past year and a bit – and to the dreams that many harbour as the national men’s team prepares for its first match at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. .The jerseys and football paraphernalia that adorn the bar’s walls are mostly donated, just like the pots and pans the couple cooks with and the mismatched cutlery resting on tables covered with white tablecloths. Leon and Lenoce pooled their resources to get the place up. They bought a large flat-screen television to broadcast World Cup games – they had to forego air conditioning. Now they wait, with their customers, for a month they hope to remember – never mind the humidity that Argentina’s capital is notorious for. .“I hope with all my heart that we win,” said Leon. “To give people a little bit of joy. People have really been struggling because of the economic situation we’re in.” .A prolonged economic crisis has eviscerated the value of the Argentinian peso and sent the annual inflation rate soaring to 88 percent in October. Argentinians are praying for reprieve, even if temporary, in the form of football glory. . .Ever since their captain, superstar Lionel Messi, led them to the Copa America win last year, expectations have been mounting that the country might finally clinch its third World Cup after years of disappointments. .The jerseys are everywhere. Bakeries are opening before dawn on Tuesday for the team’s inaugural match against Saudi Arabia – which will be at 7am local time – screens on public buses are playing clips of epic moments in the national squad’s history and it seems like, everywhere you look, there is a likeness of Messi or the iconic Diego Maradona, who died in November 2020 of heart failure and pulmonary oedema. .At a recent sold-out concert of British rock band Coldplay in a football stadium in Buenos Aires, fans broke out in an impromptu serenade to Messi, while for weeks, a frenzy over collectable World Cup stickers dominated social media. . .Criticism of Qatar as a host for the World Cup has not figured prominently in Argentina, where, for the most part, the focus is on the country’s team and its prospects. .“Argentinians have to think about how we’re going to win the World Cup with Messi,” President Alberto Fernandez said while in Bali, Indonesia, for the G20 summit earlier this month. “We have a great team and a great coach.” Lionel Scaloni, Argentina’s coach, was also in charge during the Copa America win in 2021. .Indeed, it’s hard for Daniel Rodriguez to think of anything other than the World Cup these days. Like many of his compatriots, the 50-year-old has his passion for football etched on his skin – literally. A tattoo of the local club he supports, Atlanta, is hidden under the blue and white national jersey he is sporting on a Saturday morning in La Paternal as he waits for his wife with his 10-year-old daughter. .He lowers his voice to reveal his allegiance since the neighbourhood is the home of Atlanta’s rival club, Argentinos Juniors, which was also Maradona’s first club. “For Argentinians, football means a lot. We wake up with football, we eat football and we dream of football,” he said. .At the auto parts manufacturer where he works, all eyes will be on the television set for games that fall during work hours, he said. Rodriguez is optimistic about the team’s chances, even if his predictions are measured. “As all football fans say, one step at a time.” .Alejandro Wall, an Argentinian sports journalist who has written several books on football and Maradona, said a few factors make this tournament stand out. .There is consensus over the strength of the team representing the country. It is also expected to be Messi’s last World Cup – his last shot at the coveted trophy. In Argentina, “football absorbs everything”, Wall said, even if it will not change the stark realities people are living. .Speaking from Qatar, he said he has been personally touched by the ties that bind his squad to fans from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan he has met. .“It’s the Third World united. Or countries colonised versus countries that were colonisers. I think there’s something along those lines that is happening here, too,” he told Al Jazeera. “It’s lovely to meet an Indian fan who has an Argentina jersey and is sending you good vibes.” .Back near La Paternal, there’s a different vibe – a spiritual one – that football fanatics come to soak up, at a permanent memorial dedicated to Maradona. .Diego Vannucci, Maradona’s godson – his father and the player’s agent were friends – is now caretaker of the space that sprung up on a quiet residential street in the wake of the football legend’s death. Located in what used to be lawnmower storage for the Argentinos Juniors’ stadium – just outside La Paternal – it is covered in jerseys, posters, photos, signs, piles of rosaries and other memorabilia and is dripping in love for one of the country’s favourite sons. .There are three rows of church pews where fans sit in contemplative silence, staring at a large mural of a young, smiling Maradona. Vannucci points out recent additions to the memorial, left by visitors: A red poster of Maradona’s Argentinos Junior days; a Mexican 20 peso note; a small card from Fiorito, the soccer star’s hometown. .For many in Argentina, this World Cup will be different simply because of the absence of Maradona who was more than a player. It is his larger-than-life personality that will be missed, suggested Vannucci. .“It feels empty, that’s the only way to describe it,” said the 45-year-old. “You know that Diego is not here. But on the other hand, you can feel him, accompanying us.” .To the final, Argentina will hope."

European teams ditch ‘OneLove’ armband World Cup plan,U-turn comes after FIFA threatens to hand out yellow cards to players taking part in the initiative.,".Seven European teams have abandoned plans for their captains to wear rainbow-themed armbands at the World Cup after FIFA threatened to issue yellow cards to any players who did so. .The climbdown came just hours before England’s Harry Kane, the Netherlands’ Virgil van Dijk and Wales’ Gareth Bale were due to wear the “OneLove” armbands in Monday’s group-stage games. .Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and Germany had also originally planned to take part in the campaign, which backers said was aimed at promoting inclusion. .But the seven football associations said in a joint statement that they couldn’t sacrifice success on the field for the initiative, which had also been widely viewed as a protest against laws in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. .“FIFA has been very clear that it will impose sporting sanctions if our captains wear the armbands on the field of play,” the associations said in a joint statement. .The European plans were in breach of World Cup regulations and FIFA’s general rules on team equipment at its games. .“For FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA,” the governing body’s equipment regulations state. .The associations said they had written to FIFA in September to notify the Switzerland-based organisation of their plans involving the “OneLove” armband but had not received any response. .They added they had been prepared to “pay fines” that would typically apply to breaches of kit regulations, but could not put their players “in the situation where they might be booked, or even forced to leave the field of play”. .The risk of getting a second yellow, which would see a player sent off the field for the rest of the game and banned from the next, is particularly tricky in a tournament where teams play only three games before the knockout rounds begin. .“We are very frustrated by the FIFA decision, which we believe is unprecedented,” the football associations’ statement said. .The developments attracted swift and scathing criticism from groups representing the LGBTQ community and rights groups. .“More than disappointing that @FIFAWorldCup and @FIFAcom silence & deflection means European captains face starting games with yellow cards for trying to highlight issues around human rights,” 3LionsPride, a group representing England fans, tweeted. .“Their basic rights to freedom of speech & expression being crushed by FIFA.” . .England’s Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) said it felt contempt for FIFA. .“To paraphrase FIFA president Gianni Infantino – today LGBT+ football supporters and their allies will feel angry,” it said, citing his monologue on the eve of the tournament aimed at media criticising the decision to stage the World Cup in Qatar. .“Today we feel betrayed. Today we feel contempt for an organisation that has shown its true values by giving the yellow card to players and the red card to tolerance.” .Amnesty International said FIFA was failing to uphold its own values and responsibilities. .“Sport does not happen in a vacuum and these are issues on which FIFA should be leading, not cracking down on,” Steve Cockburn, Amnesty’s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said. .“Agreements on armbands, and better protections for LGBTI communities, should have been reached a long time ago. We applaud the courage of teams and players who have spoken out about human rights and we hope they continue to do so,” he added. .FIFA launched its own captain’s armband campaign ahead of the tournament to promote different causes for each round. .On Monday it said had brought forward its own “No Discrimination” from the planned quarter-finals stage in order that all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear its own armband during the tournament. .“This is in line with Article 13.8.1 of the FIFA Equipment Regulations, which state: ‘For FIFA Final Competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA’,” the football governing body said in a statement. .Some, including former England footballer Stan Collymore, called for the national sides to disregard FIFA’s position and instead make a stand and have their captains wear the armbands. . .But German Football Association president Bernd Neuendorf said it was unfair for the players to shoulder the responsibility for any potential consequences if they decided to wear it anyway. .“We are witnessing a case with no precedent in World Cup history,” Neuendorf said. .The criminalisation of same-sex relations in Qatar has been a long-running controversy in the build-up to the World Cup. .Former Qatari international footballer and World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman sparked outrage earlier this month after calling homosexuality “damage in the mind” during an interview with a German media outlet. .Qatar has repeatedly stated that everyone was welcome to attend the tournament."

World Cup is evidence, as is the legacy of Maradona and Garrincha.",".A week or so before the kickoff of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, I was walking in the coastal city of Zihuatanejo in Mexico’s southern Guerrero state when I passed a group of children playing football with a plastic Coca-Cola bottle. They were as gleefully animated as any group of children playing football anywhere, while the Coke bottle was, I thought, regrettably appropriate in a world governed by corporate toxicity. .It was particularly appropriate, perhaps, given that Coca-Cola and football go way back. The company, which has been an official World Cup sponsor since 1978, entered into a formal association with FIFA in 1974 – although its logo has saturated World Cup events since 1950. The partnership was initially ostensibly meant to promote youth development programmes, since there is clearly nothing better for youth development than ingesting sticky brown liquid that is bad for human health. .Of course, that alliance is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of global capitalism’s efforts to suck the soul out of football and eradicate any remnants of primordial joy by monetising and commodifying everything on and off the field. Given the deluge of corporate propaganda that we call “sponsorship”, the uninitiated football spectator would be forgiven for thinking Adidas was a football team – or that matches are waged between Emirates and Etihad airlines. .And there’s nothing like sponsoring football’s biggest competition to improve one’s international branding. Chinese firms have also caught on – they’re leading in spending for the Qatar World Cup. .In his book, El Fútbol a sol y sombra (Football in sun and shadow), first published in 1995, the renowned Uruguayan writer and die-hard football fan Eduardo Galeano remarked how every footballer had become an “advertisement in motion”- though not everyone was happy with that arrangement. In the mid-1950s, he recalled, when the prominent Montevideo club Peñarol had endeavoured to impose company advertising on its shirts, 10 members of the team had obediently taken to the field with the updated jerseys while Black player Obdulio Varela had declined: “They used to drag us Blacks around with rings in our noses. Those days are gone.” .To be sure, it’s never just fun and games when obscene quantities of money are involved. Take the case of Horst Dassler – the son of Adidas founder Adi Dassler, himself charmingly a former member of the Nazi Party – who in 1982 started a company called International Sports and Leisure, which promptly acquired exclusive marketing and TV rights to FIFA operations, including the World Cup. This was done by paying bribes to then-FIFA President João Havelange – the same Havelange who had graciously appeared alongside Argentine dictator Jorge Videla during the 1978 World Cup in Buenos Aires. .That dictatorship was ultimately responsible for murdering or disappearing some 30,000 suspected leftists in a seven-year dirty war that was green-lit by – who else? – the United States, which was always eager to have more maleficent right-wing regimes on board in its quest to make the world safe for capitalism. .In 1998, Havelange was replaced by Sepp Blatter, who has also been accused of rampant vote-buying and manipulation of financial data and who, according to Galeano, made Havelange look like “a Sister of Charity”. Galeano died in April 2015, a month before the US Department of Justice sensationally busted fourteen FIFA officials and corporate executives on corruption charges, with US Attorney General Loretta Lynch lamenting that the individuals had “corrupted the business of worldwide soccer to serve their interests and enrich themselves”. .But as the US well knows, corrupt self-enrichment and corporate impunity are business as usual in capitalism – which has also produced a “gentrification” of the sport itself, as researchers have shown. A study published by the Royal Society in December 2021 found that the “excessive monetisation of football” had led to increasing inequality between teams in major European leagues and a growing predictability of match outcomes. Even as those responsible for the sport’s governance claim to be globalising football, in reality, the process replicates the inequality endemic to corporate globalisation. .Indeed, the very spirit of professional football has been corrupted by the conversion of the sport into an industry – resulting in a regimented and technocratic game that aims to turn players into robots. As Galeano put it, this approach to football “forbids all fun”; in the interest of maximised productivity and increased profit, it “negates joy, kills fantasy, and outlaws daring”. Magic, after all, is not profitable. .Mercifully, however, there have always been folks who refuse to get with the programme. In Galeano’s view, Brazilian footballer Mané Garrincha, born into poverty in Rio de Janeiro in 1933, was hands-down the player who brought the most happiness to audiences in the entire history of football, turning the game into an “invitation to a party”. So much for the doctors who pooh-poohed the prospect of any athletic future for “this misshapen survivor of hunger and polio… with the brain of an infant, a spinal column like an S and both legs bowed to the same side”. (Capitalism won in the end, and Garrincha died, poor and alone, in 1983.) .Argentina’s football virtuoso Diego Maradona, also from the wrong side of the tracks, defied boundaries, too – including by denouncing the tyranny of television in sport, advocating for labour rights in football, demanding financial transparency from football clubs, supporting the Palestinian cause, and generally driving the powers that be up the wall. On the field, he continued injecting old-school magic into modern mediocrity until he was expelled from the 1994 World Cup. .Meanwhile, more recent resistance to football’s descent into soulless, money-driven depths was seen last year, when furious fans in the United Kingdom helped force the collapse of a Super League scheme designed to further line the pockets of elite club owners. .Sure, capitalism has certainly scored a major goal with professional football. .But the sport remains a source of popular passion and an affirmation of collective identity for countless people, on sports courts, grass pitches and dirt patches from Mexico to Mozambique – far from the billions of dollars swirling through the football industrial complex. .As the 22nd World Cup kicks off in Qatar today, Galeano would no doubt have criticised the whole televised spectacle. And yet he would have no doubt watched it on his TV, beer in hand, hoping for a glimpse of forbidden fun – a moment of unadulterated brilliance and beauty. Because as with the kids kicking the Coca-Cola bottle around Zihuatanejo, there’s something about football that capitalism just can’t kill. .The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

our captain will be wearing the OneLove armband,” Eriksen said. .“What the consequences will be I don’t know, but we’ll see.” .Denmark sporting director Peter Moller described the timing of FIFA’s announcement as “a little bit strange”. .“We think the [armband] that we are playing with,” Moller said, “is an even stronger statement.” .Denmark had asked football governing body FIFA to wear shirts carrying the slogan “Human rights for all” during training sessions, but the request was denied because it is a “political message”, according to the federation. .England’s Three Lions are also believed to be ready to support the “OneLove” campaign and are understood to be seeking clarity on whether the rainbow armband and the FIFA ones can be worn together. .The United States team have also shown their support with a rainbow-coloured logo inside their training facility."

I would also implore all politicians to refer to official specialised organisations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) … when sourcing accurate information,” he said. . .In February 2021, the Guardian newspaper reported that 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in the country since 2010, when Qatar was awarded the World Cup. .The Qatari government has stated that these figures, provided by the respective countries’ embassies, included deaths of people not working on World Cup projects. It said, “The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population.” .The government said there were 37 deaths between 2014 and 2020 among workers directly linked to the construction of World Cup stadiums, of which three were “work-related”. .Last month, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said his country faced an “unprecedented campaign” of criticism in the lead-up to the event, which raised questions “about the real reasons and motives” behind the campaign. Senior Qatari officials have also denounced the “hypocrisy” of people calling for a boycott of the World Cup to protest against alleged human rights in the Gulf country. .French publication Le Canard enchainé recently sparked outrage after publishing a cartoon depicting Qatari footballers as terrorists. The caricature was blasted by social media users as “blatant Islamophobia” and “racism”. .On Monday, al-Marri said: “The slanders and allegations against Qatar began to take a different turn in adopting hate and racist rhetoric with the aim of offending the Qatari people and their national team.” .He added: “We will not accept hate speech and systematic racism towards our people, our country and our team, and we call on international human rights organisations to take firm stances against anyone who engages in this attack.” . .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been in the spotlight since it was awarded the tournament, leading to calls for teams to boycott the tournament altogether. .The country faced widespread criticism from human rights groups for its previous use of the kafala system – under which workers are tied to an employer whose consent they need to change jobs in the form of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) – a law that rights activists have argued tied their presence in Qatar to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .The need for a NOC to change employment was scrapped in August 2020 amid other landmark changes, including the introduction of a minimum wage. Qatar also introduced a minimum wage and new regulations on working in heat, as part of a labour reform process that it said was launched before it was awarded the World Cup. .In his speech on Monday, al-Marri said critics of Qatar were purposely ignoring the country’s labour reforms because “they do not serve their misleading stories”. .The ILO, in a report released this month, said Qatar had made progress in its labour reforms but challenges in their implementation remained. It said the changes have improved the working and living conditions for hundreds of thousands of workers – estimated to form 85 percent of Qatar’s population – though additional efforts were needed to ensure that all workers could benefit. .The World Cup kicks off on November 20, with the opening match seeing the hosts take Ecuador in Al Bayt Stadium. The final will take place on December 18. ."

We think that the human rights are universal, and we stand by this view,” Jensen said on Thursday. .“FIFA has a different assessment, and sadly we had to take that into consideration”. .The decision comes a week after FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Secretary-General Fatma Samoura sent a letter to all 32 World Cup teams urging them to “focus on the football” in Qatar and not let the sport “be dragged into every ideological battle that exists”. .The letter was a response to the protests made by several World Cup teams over the treatment of migrant workers and human rights in Qatar. .Denmark had earlier announced a “toned-down” kit ahead of the World Cup with a third all-black kit which it said represented the “colour of mourning”. .The Danish manufacturer Hummel issued a statement which said it did not wish “to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of people their lives”. . .Hummel received criticism after the announcement for manufacturing about a third of its apparel in China, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh, where human rights and labour laws have been called into question. .Qatar’s World Cup organising committee had previously responded to Denmark’s World Cup kit, saying Qatar had used the tournament “as a catalyst to drive change” and had reformed its migrant worker laws. .Jensen said that despite FIFA’s rejection of the proposed training kit, the DBU would continue its efforts to raise concerns. .Jensen said he had travelled to Qatar three times in the last 10 months, where he had met migrant workers who had told him that the dialogue they had conducted “makes a difference”."

The reality is that the world is looking forward to this celebration. Over 97 percent of the tickets have been sold. Among the 10 countries that bought the most tickets, we find European countries like France,” Al Thani, who is also the deputy prime minister, said. .Qatar is the first country in the Middle East to host the football World Cup but it has faced a wave of criticism since it was awarded the tournament in 2010. In particular, its treatment of migrant workers and its human rights records have been under the spotlight, leading to calls for teams to boycott the tournament altogether. .The country faced widespread criticism from human rights groups for its previous use of the kafala system – under which workers are tied to an employer whose consent they need to change jobs in the form of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) – a law that rights activists have argued tied their presence in Qatar to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .The kafala system was abolished in August 2020 in Qatar amid other landmark changes, including the introduction of a minimum wage. .Several Gulf countries have, in recent years, enacted reforms to their kafala systems, which were once prevalent across the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. .Responding to a query on why it took so long for Qatar to abolish the kafala setup, considering all the stadiums had been built by 2020, Al Thani said such reforms “take time”. .“This is true for any country – it is not unique to Qatar. Of course, there are still flaws and we are determined to fix them,” he said. .However, the deputy prime minister said there was a “double standard” in “systematically” blaming the Qatari government for the problems facing labourers, while in Europe, “the slightest incident is blamed on the company”. .“I think there are some people who don’t accept that a small country in the Middle East is hosting such a global event,” he added. .In the interview, Al Thani said Qatar was a “very welcoming country” and that the “entire world is welcome in our country”. .“All we ask is that fans respect our laws, just as we are expected to respect yours when we visit you,” he added. .The deputy prime minister said there would not be confrontations between security forces and fans unless certain behaviours put people in danger. “That is the only situation in which they would intervene.” .When asked what policy Qatar would adopt if players were to speak on non-sporting issues, Al Thani said they “will be free to do so, we will never stop anyone from expressing themselves”. .Several participating teams have highlighted the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar, including Denmark, Australia and England. .Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister said Qatar will continue to host sports tournaments in the future to help “unite” people. .“Our ambition is to do things that bring people together and unite them. Sport is an important tool to achieve this goal. Our country is ready to host major sporting events. The World Cup is just one example of this,” he said. .The World Cup will take place from November 20 to December 18."

It said, “The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population.” .The government said there were 37 deaths between 2014 and 2020 among workers directly linked to the construction of World Cup stadiums, of which three were “work-related”. .Denmark recently announced its players would wear a “toned down” kit during the World Cup, with Danish manufacturer Hummel saying it “does not wish to be visible” at a tournament that “has cost thousands of lives”. .“We support the Danish national team, but that isn’t the same as supporting Qatar as a host nation,” it said. .Khaled al-Suwaidi, a senior member of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, responded to Denmark’s announcement, saying the country has used the World Cup “as a catalyst to drive change” and has reformed its migrant worker laws. .The Australian national team recently released a video criticising Qatar for its human rights record and calling for the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships, which are strictly prohibited in Qatar. .The tournament’s organisers praised the Australian players for “using their platforms to raise awareness for important matters”. Still, they added, “No country is perfect, and every country – hosts of major events or not – has its challenges.” . .The captains of nine teams will wear rainbow armbands to support the LGBTQ community. .World Cup organisers have said everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome while also warning against public displays of affection. .Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp recently stated that he believed it was “not fair” to expect players to make political statements. “The decision [to hold the tournament in Qatar] was made by other people, and if you want to criticise anybody, criticise the people who made the decision,” he said. .In a recent television interview, the German minister for sport, Nancy Faeser, appeared to question whether Qatar should stage the tournament due to the alleged mistreatment of migrant workers and the LGBTQ community. .She later said her remarks had been “misinterpreted“, adding, “It is important to support the country of Qatar in groundbreaking reforms.”"

In August 2020, Qatar announced changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for a no-objection certificate (NOC) to change employment. .The announcement was the latest in a series of labour reforms which it said were part of a process launched before it was awarded the World Cup. .The ILO, in the report, added that Qatar’s labour ministry has approved about 350,000 applications by migrant workers to change jobs in the two years since these reforms were introduced. .The report added that many workers still face hurdles in leaving jobs and moving to new ones, including retaliation from their employers. .Workers have also told Al Jazeera of the difficulties in switching jobs, from cancellation of residency permits and threats of deportation by private sponsors and false absconding cases registered against them. .In March last year, Qatar became the first country in the Gulf to adopt a minimum wage that applies to all workers. .The new legislation ensured all employees receive a minimum monthly wage of 1,000 Qatari riyals ($275), as well as a minimum allowance of 300 riyals for food and 500 riyals for housing, unless their employer provides both. .ILO said 280,000 people saw their salaries rise to the new minimum threshold – termed inadequate by workers and rights groups – since the new legislation was introduced. .Last month, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said his country faced an “unprecedented campaign” of criticism in the lead-up to the World Cup. .“Since we won the honour of hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been subjected to an unprecedented campaign that no host country has ever faced,” Sheikh Tamim said in a speech. “We initially dealt with the matter in good faith, and even considered that some criticism was positive and useful, helping us to develop aspects of ours that need to be developed. .“But it soon became clear to us that the campaign continues, expands and includes fabrication and double standards, until it reached a level of ferocity that made many question, unfortunately, about the real reasons and motives behind this campaign.”"

India was briefly suspended for the same reason in August this year. .FIFA confirmed the letter to Reuters news agency but refused to comment further. There was no immediate comment from the TFF. .The letter from Kenny Jean-Marie, FIFA’s director of member associations, to the general secretary of the TFF Wajdi Aouadi reminded the association of its obligation to act independently and avoid undue influence by third parties. .“Any failure to comply with these obligations may result in the imposition of penalties under the FIFA laws, including suspension of the relevant association,” it said. .The team has never made it out of the group stages. At Russia 2018, it registered only its second win in the World Cup and its first since 1978 after defeating Panama 2-1."

The conditions there are abominable and many have lost their lives.” .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of the tournament in 2010. .The country said it has carried out several labour reforms in the run-up to the mega event that takes place in November and December next year. .In August last year, Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for a “no-objection certificate” – an employer’s permission to change jobs. Earlier this year, a new minimum wage law was also introduced. .In a poll published by the VG newspaper last week, nearly half of Norwegians (49 percent) are in favour of a boycott, while only 29 percent are against. . .Feeling the pressure from grassroots campaigns, the NFF referred the matter to an extraordinary congress which on Sunday brought together its eight-member executive committee and representatives of 18 districts and hundreds of professional and amateur clubs. .Discussions revolved around the findings of an expert committee which, with the exception of two members representing fans, had already also come out against a boycott. .Rather than a boycott, the committee had recommended 26 measures to consolidate and further the gains made in Qatar. .Norway’s national squad has already protested conditions in Qatar but stopped short of calling for a boycott. .Before recent games, Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland, captain Martin Odegaard and their teammates wore t-shirts with slogans like “HUMAN RIGHTS On and off the pitch”. .FIFA argue that awarding the hosting of the World Cup to Qatar has opened the door to social progress. .“We know there is still work to be done, but we need to recognise the significant progress achieved in a very short time,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in May. ."

Cup?,"Ahead of qualifiers, Norway, Germany and Netherlands footballers have protested Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers.",".Footballers are staging on-field protests in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers to highlight Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record that have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of next year’s tournament. .A media report published earlier this month alleged that 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since 2010 when the country was awarded hosting rights of the 2022 tournament. .Qatar responded by saying that “the mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population”. .There have also been protests against harsh working conditions, especially during the summer when temperature often goes past 40C (104F), wage abuse – including on a World Cup stadium site – and lack of rights afforded to migrant workers, who comprise about 95 percent of Qatar’s population. .Qatar’s government told Al Jazeera it has made several reforms over the years around working conditions and labour rights. .The Netherlands national team wore t-shirts emblazoned with the words “Football supports change”. .Norway players wore shirts stating “HUMAN RIGHTS” and “On and off the pitch”. .The German team lined up in black shirts, each with one white letter to spell out “HUMAN RIGHTS” but its football association said it was opposed to boycotting the World Cup. .On Sunday, Denmark players will “dare to make stand in favour of human rights”. .Last week, Amnesty International sent a letter to FIFA President Gianni Infantino, calling on world football’s governing body to use its leverage with the Qatari authorities to help end the abuse of migrant workers. .In August 2020, Qatar announced landmark changes to the labour law, including scrapping the need for an NOC – employer’s permission to change jobs – that rights activists said tied workers’ presence in the country to their employers and led to abuse and exploitation. .The announcement was the latest in a series of labour reforms carried out by the country in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup. .In response to the report earlier this month, Qatar’s World Cup organising committee said it has “always been transparent about the health and safety of workers”. .“Since construction [of stadiums] began in 2014, there have been three work-related fatalities and 35 non-work-related deaths,” a representative said. “The SC [organising committee] has investigated each case, learning lessons to avoid any repeat in the future.” .Earlier this month, Qatar’s Government Communication Office (GCO) told Al Jazeera the country “has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs… to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective”. .“We have improved health and safety standards for workers, strengthened the capacity of labour inspectors… increased the penalties for companies that violate the law,” a recent GCO statement said. .FIFA’s disciplinary code states players and federations can face disciplinary action in cases of “using a sports event for demonstrations of a non-sporting nature”. .However, the organisation said it will not be opening a case against the protests by Germany and Norway players. .“FIFA believes in the freedom of speech and in the power of football as a force for good,” a FIFA spokesperson said. .Last week, Infantino said Qatar has made social progress because of becoming the World Cup host. .England manager Gareth Southgate said the English Football Association and Amnesty have been in talks. .Germany midfielder Joshua Kimmich said the boycott calls have come “10 years too late”. .“It wasn’t allocated this year, but a couple of years ago. One should have thought about boycotting back then,” said Kimmich. .“Now we need to take the opportunity and use our publicity to raise awareness about things. But it’s not just down to us footballers … we should work together.” .Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said it would be a mistake for teams to boycott the World Cup in the wake of player protests."

The committee said owed wages continued to be paid. .QMC was in February taken off the stadium project in and banned from working on World Cup projects until further notice, it said. .“Since construction began in 2014, we have made significant progress and achievements in the area of workers’ welfare. There will always be challenges to address and we are committed to overcoming them,”
the committee said in a statement. .The committee said it was “unacceptable” for workers to suffer hardship and that it was fully committed to the ethical treatment of workers. . .Qatar’s government communication office said QMC had been financially sanctioned and its operations suspended until all outstanding salaries were paid. .The company has since been sold and actions by the new owners to rectify “the neglect of the previous owner”, including renewing residency permits and health insurance, are being overseen by the labour ministry. .“The State of Qatar does not tolerate the unscrupulous treatment of workers,” it said. .Steven Cockburn, Amnesty’s head of economic and social justice said: “Although recent payments will provide some welcome relief for workers, Qatar’s World Cup organisers told us they had known about the salary delays since July 2019. .“This raises the question of why Qatar allowed workers to continue working for months without pay,” he added. .Amnesty accused FIFA of failing to take human rights abuses linked to the 2022 World Cup seriously. .FIFA told Amnesty it contacted the Qatari authorities once it became aware of the investigation, and is now working to ensure that outstanding payments are made."

Cup organising committee but other employers could improve protections.,".Improved safeguards and working hours are needed to further protect labourers in Qatar from the effects of heat and humidity, the United Nations said, as it published new research. .Qatar has come under scrutiny for conditions faced by its hundreds of thousands of migrant workers as it prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. .The risks of Qatar’s heat and humidity were again thrust into the spotlight at the recent World Athletics Championships in Doha when women’s marathon runners collapsed because of the conditions, despite the race being staged at midnight. .Humidity hovered around 73 percent and the temperature was 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit) for much of last month’s race. .The study, commissioned by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and Qatar’s labour ministry, praised measures taken to reduce the effects of heat on 4,000 workers at one World Cup stadium project. .It concluded that while the heat mitigation steps taken by the body responsible for delivering the football showcase were “moderately to highly acceptable”, other employers in Qatar could improve protections. .The head of the UN agency’s Qatar project office, Houtan Homayounpour, said the project was working with the government to turn the study’s recommendations into “improved legislation”. .“We have a scientific basis on which to propose adjustments to the prohibited working hours during summer, and it is clear that heat stress mitigation plans must recognise the right and enhance the ability of workers to self-pace,” he said in a statement. .The law currently states that work on exposed sites must stop between 11:30am and 3:00pm during the summer months. .Researchers from the University of Thessaly reviewed more than 5,500 hours of work as part of their research, the largest ever study of its kind and the first in the region. .“The research examined different strategies for mitigating heat strain, focusing on hydration, work-rest ratios and clothing,” the statement said. .Workers on the stadium project, run by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) organising the World Cup, mitigated conditions through frequent breaks as well as access to shade and water, according to the study. .The researchers recommended companies in Qatar introduce heat stress alleviation plans and annual health check-ups as well as make adjustments to summertime working hours and empower employees to take responsibility for their welfare. .Projects run by the SC are acknowledged by human rights groups to generally offer their workers better protections and rights than schemes not under the supervision of the World Cup organisers. .On Thursday, Human Rights Watch called on Qatar to “thoroughly and urgently investigate” worker deaths following the publication of research linking cardiovascular fatalities in the country to heatstroke. .“The sudden and unexpected deaths of often young and healthy migrant workers in Qatar have gone uninvestigated by Qatari authorities, in apparent disregard for workers’ lives,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW. .“Qatar cannot claim to uphold migrant workers’ rights as long as it ignores urgent and repeated calls for lifesaving reforms that protect workers from the heat.” .The study, published by Cardiology Journal in July, probed the “relationship between deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure”, according to HRW. .Government spokesman, Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al-Thani, said in a statement: “Qatar has worked relentlessly for years … to ensure the wellbeing and safety of all workers” and that “to suggest otherwise is false and misleading.” .“Our work with international organisations and partners has resulted in Qatar leading the region on workers’ health and safety.” .He added that summer working hours had been “strictly implemented” and more than 300 work suspension cases were ordered in summer 2019."

issues after report says hundreds of workers returned home ‘penniless’.,".Doha, Qatar – There have been renewed calls for Qatar to address and review its treatment of migrant workers after a new Amnesty International report revealed that “hundreds of migrant workers” have been forced to give up on “justice” and return home “penniless” since March 2018. .Qatar and its labour laws have been under the spotlight ever since the country was named the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Its government has pledged to resolve labour disputes in the run-up to the tournament. .In the report published on Thursday, Amnesty said it followed the “search for justice of more than 2,000 people working for Hamton International, Hamad bin Khaled bin Hamad (HKH) and United Cleaning after the companies stopped paying their wages for several months, citing financial difficulties”. .The companies then ceased operations and ended the contracts, prompting at least 1,620 of these workers to submit complaints to the Committees for the Settlement of Labour Disputes. .“While some of them were eventually given part of what they were owed by their employers in exchange for dropping their cases, most went home with nothing,” said the report. .The committee received more than 6,000 complaints last year, according to the report which added that most of them had not been resolved at the end of the year. .“Despite the significant promises of reform which Qatar has made ahead of the 2022 World Cup, it remains a playground for unscrupulous employers,” said Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty International’s deputy director of global issues. .“Migrant workers often go to Qatar in the hope of giving their families a better life. Instead, many people return home penniless after spending months chasing their wages, with too little help from the systems that are supposed to protect them.” .In a statement to Al Jazeera in the wake of the Amnesty report, Qatar’s Government Communications Office said, “Qatar has made substantial progress on labour reforms and it continues to work with NGOs, including the International Labour Organization, to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective.” .“Any issues or delays with our systems will be addressed comprehensively. We have said, from the outset, that this would take time, resources and commitment,” the statement said. .In August, there were calls for Qatar to completely “remove the power imbalance between employees and the employers” after at least 5,000 workers took to the streets to protest salary delays and working conditions. .Employees of Iskan and Tashgeel, working on construction projects throughout Qatar, staged peaceful strikes on August 4 and 5 near their accommodation camps in Shahaniya, just over 30km outside the capital, Doha. .Protesting workers, mostly from Bangladesh, told Al Jazeera that in addition to poor living conditions, they had not been paid for four months, the companies had failed to renew their work permits – making their status in Qatar illegal – and were not given the required letters that would allow them to switch employers. .Under Qatar’s “kafala” (Arabic word for sponsorship) system, migrant workers must obtain their employers’ permission – a no-objection certificate (NOC) – before changing jobs, a law that rights activists say ties them with their employers and fuels abuse and exploitation. .“We protested for six hours in order to demand our rights and salaries that amount to 1,200 Qatari riyals [$329] a month,” one of the Iskan workers, who was part of the protest, told Al Jazeera. .“We have to look after ourselves. The reason we came to Qatar was to earn money and support our families back home,” said another worker. “What’s the point of being here if we’re not getting that?” .The government said an investigation was launched following the protests and, in addition to authorised signatories of the two companies being arrested, the “outstanding salaries of all workers were paid in full”. .“The findings of the investigation confirmed that salaries had been delayed following a period of negative cash flow at both companies, caused by non-payments elsewhere in the supply chain,” a government statement said. .The Iskan workers interviewed by Al Jazeera confirmed the payment but said there were deductions and the company still owed them money. They said they were “glad that the government intervened and got us our dues” before adding that there were “pending issues that needed resolving”. .The workers said no officials from the company came to visit the camps following the protests. .Iskan and Tashgeel did not respond to requests for comment from Al Jazeera on the allegations. .Both the companies are also providing the workforce for the construction of the 2022 World Cup stadiums. Tournament organisers told Al Jazeera that 203 workers from the two companies “currently engaged on FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 projects were not part of the strike action taken”. .But it did not confirm whether those employees had unpaid dues. .“The Government of Qatar places the utmost importance on strengthening the rights of its guest workers and ensuring that all companies respect these rights and adhere to Qatar’s labour laws,” added the government statement issued last month. .In response to an earlier Amnesty International report warning that Qatar was “running out of time” to stamp out labour abuse, the gas-rich peninsula in the Gulf promised to treat labour reforms as “a journey and not an end in itself”. .Last year, Qatar announced it was abolishing the need for exit permits for non-domestic migrant workers. It also did away with the need for an NOC if the migrant worker completed the contract duration or finished five years in the event of an undefined time period in a contract. .However, rights groups have demanded wholesale reforms, including the abolishment of the kafala system. .“I don’t think Qatar has gotten far enough [with the labour reforms],” Hiba Zayadin, Gulf researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera. “What’s needed to really see improvements on the ground is the abolishment of the kafala system. .“The introduction of minor reforms is not able to tilt the power imbalance between the employee and the employer. This allows employers to have several tools at their disposal that they can use to keep workers in those conditions.” .In the Asian Town area of Qatar’s industrial area, a security officer told Al Jazeera his colleagues staged a small protest demanding their overtime payments which were held back for three months. .He said all his colleagues worked 12-hour shifts every day, amounting to 72 hours a week. Qatar’s labour laws stipulate a maximum 48 hours of work a week without overtime, reduced to 36 hours during the holy month of Ramadan. .“To ask for your right in this country is to have your ticket back home issued,” he said. “I was promised a higher salary in my country but was told to sign a different contract when I arrived in Qatar. I had taken a huge loan to pay the agent back home in order to get this job, so I had no choice but to sign it.” .Other migrant workers that Al Jazeera spoke to shared similar concerns, including salary delays, unlawful termination and stories of poor accommodation where “five to six people shared a room and there was no place to even walk”. .Qatar’s labour ministry has welcomed workers to lodge their complaints with it, but the majority finds it risky to take that course for fear of serious repercussions from their employers. .“There’s definitely a lack of faith in the system and in the available avenues,” Zayadin said. .“Which is why the government needs to address the NOC issue. Once you reduce the tools for an employer to retaliate, the workers will be less afraid of coming forward as their immigration status will not be connected to the employer they’re are complaining about.” .*No workers wanted their names published in the story. ."

And while Amnesty acknowledged Qatar had undertaken a reform process, it added that work still needed to be done. .Qatar, a gas-rich peninsula in the Gulf, has said that it was committed to labour reforms, adding that “lasting changes” take time. .“Far from seeing time as running out, the Government of the State of Qatar understands further change is needed and we remain committed to developing these changes as quickly as possible, while ensuring they are effective and appropriate for our labour market conditions,” the statement further said. .“Practical, efficient and lasting change takes time and that is what we have committed to.” .The statement also added that the government “penalised or banned” almost 12,000 companies in the country for violating its labour laws. .Last year, Qatar amended its residency law to allow most migrant workers to leave the country without an exit visa, a move that was termed a “huge step” by the International Organization for Labour (ILO). .According to the head of the ILO Project Office in Qatar, Houtan Homayounpour, great progress has been made with regards to labour reforms in the country but the work is far from finished. .“There are remaining milestones to be achieved, such as the removal of the exit visa for domestic workers, a non-discriminatory permanent minimum wage, the removal of the NOC requirement, to name a few,” Homayounpour told Al Jazeera. .“These are in line with the agreed priorities with the government as a work plan for 2019.”  .Although the Amnesty report focuses on conditions of the nearly two million migrant workers in Qatar, not just the 30,000 on direct World Cup projects, Amnesty said FIFA had an “ongoing responsibility” to prevent abuse. .In response, football’s governing body welcomed Qatari labour reforms in recent months and its continued work with “stakeholders”. .In late 2017, a number of contractors working for Qatar 2022 launched an initiative to partially reimburse workers, assigned to some World Cup projects, recruitment fee they had been unlawfully charged in the country of origin. .Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary-general of the World Cup 2022 organising committee, said it was the organisation’s belief that “this World Cup can be a catalyst for change, both in Qatar and in other parts of the world”. .“Unethical recruitment is a global issue and an area many countries struggle to manage. All too often, the very people who have left their home to provide for their families are the ones exploited,” said al-Thawadi.  ."

of migrant workers,Trade unions urge Gulf nations to follow Qatar’s lead as UN’s ILO dismisses complaints over foreign labour treatment.,".The UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO) has dismissed complaints about the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and welcomed the nation’s commitment to improve their plight. .The rights body announced on Wednesday its decision to not follow up on earlier complaints about the treatment of foreign labour in the Gulf nation.  .As part of a new draft bill, Qatar announced plans to introduce a minimum wage and allow the monitoring of labour practices by trained inspectors last month.  .Issa Saad al-Nuaimi, Qatar’s labour minister, said that a support fund would ensure overdue wages were paid to workers. .“The ILO welcomes the commitment of Qatar to engage in substantive cooperation with the organisation for the promotion and protection of workers’ rights, and looks forward to the successful implementation of the cooperation programme over the next three years,” ILO Director General Guy Ryder said. .In reviewing complaints lodged in 2014 over Qatar’s failure to maintain a legal framework sufficient to protect the rights of the migrant workers, ILO welcomed the “positive change” in the country.  .“The transformation of this complaint into a real commitment by the government of Qatar to make positive change on the ground for all workers is a very encouraging development,” said Luc Cortebeeck, chairperson of ILO’s Governing Body.  .“We celebrate this moment for Qatar and its two million migrant workers,” he added. .Qatar has come under scrutiny for its treatment of foreign workers from countries such as India, Nepal and Bangladesh, as it is in the process of building new infrastructure in the run-up to hosting the 2022 football World Cup. .To provide legal protection to workers, Qatar has signed 36 bilateral agreements with countries from which it draws most of its foreign workforce. .Labour minister Nuaimi welcomed ILO’s decision to cancel the complaints.  .“This [decision] clearly states the degree to which Qatar is committed to the international labour standards,” he told Al Jazeera. “It also proves how Qatar is caring for labour and their rights.” .Al Jazeera’s Jamal Elshayyal, reporting from the Swiss city of Geneva, said Wednesday’s development was a “major breakthrough in the region”. .“Much of these countries particularly in the GCC depend heavily on the work and the essentially the blood, sweat and tears of millions of workers,” he said. .Last year, the Qatari government introduced a new labour law aimed at making it easier for migrant workers to change jobs and leave the country. .The law was implemented to ease the requirements of the work sponsorship system, known as Kafala, which currently requires all foreign workers to obtain their employer’s consent to travel abroad or switch jobs. .General-Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, Sharan Burrow, who was one of the most vocal critics of Qatar’s policies over the past few years, urged other Gulf nations, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) “to follow the lead of Qatar”.  .“This is a historic day,” she told Al Jazeera. “We look forward to a world cup now with worker’s rights we can all support.”   .In response to ILO’s announcement, rights group Humanity United stressed that migrant workers in Qatar were still vulnerable to exploitation, and that the ILO should keep watching over their plight. .“Despite the decision close the complaint against Qatar, migrant workers are still vulnerable to forced labor and exploitation because of legal and social structures,” Rola Abimourched, manager of investments at Humanity United, said in a statement. .“We believe no real improvement can happen for these workers until the Qatari government removes restrictions on workers’ mobility, improves complaints mechanisms and ensures workers do not face retaliation for reporting violations, and protects all workers, including those not covered by the labor law, such as domestic workers. .“The technical cooperation agreement between the ILO and the Qatari government is encouraging, but there will be no progress for workers until these promises are turned into actions,” she added. .Abimourched urged the ILO, its governing body, and key member states to monitor the situation in Qatar “to ensure that the government fully implements the reforms it has committed to and takes additional steps to protect all workers”. .There are an estimated two million migrant workers in Qatar. The majority hail from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan."

The objective is to provide legal protection to workers.  .The agreement was signed on Wednesday following a meeting between the Qatari labour minister and heads of diplomatic missions in Qatar. .The Arab Gulf state has come under scrutiny for its treatment of foreign workers from countries such as India, Nepal and Bangladesh, as it is in the process of building new infrastructure in the run-up to hosting the 2022 football World Cup. .The Belgium-based International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) welcomed the new measures, describing them as a “breakthrough”. .“Following discussions in Doha, there is a clear government commitment to normalise industrial protections for migrant workers,” said Sharan Burrow, ITUC’s general secretary, in a statement on their website on Wednesday. .“These initiatives have the support of the ITUC, and we hope that implementation will also be supported by the ILO with its technical expertise. Much remains to be done, but these steps open the way for workers to be treated with dignity and for their lives and livelihoods to be protected,” she added. .Last year, the Qatari government also introduced a new labour law aimed at making it easier for migrant workers to change jobs and leave the country.  .The law was implemented to ease the requirements of the work sponsorship system, known as Kefala, which currently requires all foreign workers to obtain their employer’s consent to travel abroad or switch jobs. .The 2016 law established the creation of state-run “grievance committees” to which workers can call on if employers deny them permission to leave the country. .To prevent delays in workers’ salaries, a mechanism called the “Wage Protection System” was introduced in 2015. As part of this mechanism, companies are required to transfer the salaries of all employees through an electronic system to the employees’ accounts in one of the state’s recognised financial institutions. ."

Some 800,000 work in the construction sector. .Breaking with tradition by starting in the Gulf state’s much-cooler winter, the 2022 edition of the FIFA World Cup will take place from November 21 to December 18. ."

That number is set to increase to 36,000 within the next two years. .Qatar has come under international criticism for the treatment of its migrant labour force ever since being chosen to host the 2022 World Cup. .Earlier this year, Amnesty International accused Qatar of using “forced labour” at a World Cup site, the Khalifa International Stadium. .In October, it was revealed that Anil Kumar Pasman, a 29-year-old Nepalese labourer, had died after being struck by a truck at Al-Wakrah stadium, the first “work-related” death announced by Qatar’s World Cup organisers."

They withhold salaries up to six months,” he said. .Still, Ashish is optimistic about one aspect of the new law. .“Even if it’s difficult to seek a no-objection letter from my employer, as long as the new company I’m applying to is ready to give me a visa, I can exit Doha and come back in five to 10 days,” he said. .Amnesty International said in a statement that the new law would “barely scratch the surface of an abusive system”. .The UK-based rights group called on Qatar to abolish exit permits altogether and ban passport confiscation, as leaving those mechanisms in place leaves workers “at serious risk of human rights abuses”.  .Amnesty International has been among the vocal critics of the country’s labour laws, calling for improvements that would specifically target working and living conditions of construction workers. .“We urge the international community not to draw any definitive conclusions until there has been time to see the new law in action,” minister Nuaimi said. .Qatar is building hotels, a port, a financial district and several football stadiums linked by desert highways as part of a $200bn construction boom funded by natural gas revenues that have declined since global oil prices fell in mid-2014. .A workforce of 2.1 million foreigners outnumbers Qatari citizens by about 10 to one. Unions and labour protests are banned. .The UN’s International Labour Organization will issue a report in March 2017, determining whether Qatar is taking sufficient steps to prevent forced labour."

abuse,Living conditions and delayed salaries among concerns raised but Qatar says reforms are being implemented.,".Workers in Qatar renovating a stadium for the 2022 World Cup have suffered rights abuses two years after the tournament’s organisers drafted worker welfare standards in the wake of criticism, Amnesty International said. .According to a report released on Thursday, dozens of construction workers from Nepal and India were housed in squalid accommodation and barred from leaving the country by employers in Qatar who confiscated their passports. .The Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, the organisers for the 2022 World Cup, told Al Jazeera that “the conditions reported were not representative of the entire work force on Khalifa [the stadium where the workers were interviewed]”. . .Between February and May 2015, Amnesty says it interviewed 132 workers involved in the rebuilding of the Khalifa stadium, a sporting complex in Doha that is set to host one of the knockout games of the tournament. .The report said staff from one labour-supply firm threatened to withhold pay and report workers to police to exact labour from migrants, which the group called “forced labour”. .When Amnesty International researchers returned to Qatar in February 2016, some of the workers had been moved to better accommodation and their passports returned by companies responding to the findings. .“The abuse of migrant workers is a stain on the conscience of world football,” said Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty. .“For players and fans, a World Cup stadium is a place of dreams. For some of the workers who spoke to us, it can feel like a living nightmare.” .Many of the points raised in the report have already been addressed, according to Qatar’s Government Communication Office, and the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy confirmed that two of the contractors named in the report “are no longer eligible to work on future projects”. .“We are concerned by a number of allegations contained within the report,” a statement from the Government Communication Office said.  .“The Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs intends to investigate the contractors named in the report,” the statement said. .READ MORE: FBI to probe Russia and Qatar World Cup bids .Hassan Al Thawadi, Qatar’s 2022 committee chief, said Amnesty had highlighted “malpractices” faced by some of the 5,100 construction workers building stadiums, a figure set to increase sevenfold to 36,000 in the next two years. .“We’ve always recognised that we don’t have a magic wand that could fix the matter from the very beginning,” Thawadi told reporters in Doha on Monday, calling the World Cup a “catalyst for change”. .“We’re resolving gaps day by day.” . .Following persistent criticism from rights groups of its ‘Kafala’ sponsorship laws, Qatar last year introduced electronic payment of salaries and created an appeal process for workers if employers do not sanction their leaving the country. .The sponsorship system, variants of which are used across the Gulf, binds workers to their employers by requiring them to get permission to change jobs or leave the country. .READ MORE: Qatar rebuffs England FA criticism over 2022 World Cup .“Amnesty International’s investigation was limited to just four companies out of more than 40 currently engaged on Khalifa International Stadium,” said a Qatar 2022 committee statement sent to Al Jazeera. .“The conditions reported were not representative of the entire work force on Khalifa. As a result of the Supreme Committee’s continued enforcement and monitoring efforts, many of the issues raised had been addressed by June of 2015, months before the publication of Amnesty’s report. .“In June 2015 – seven months before Amnesty contacted us – Nakheel Landscapes had undergone a comprehensive rectification process, and are one of the most compliant companies on site. Eversendai, although having gone through a significant rectification process, have been banned from subsequent World Cup projects until they can demonstrate sustainable improvements.” .Qatar was awarded hosting rights for the World Cup six years ago, a move that was heavily criticised not only due to the alleged human rights violations in the country but also the extreme summer heat that would make it impossible for the tournament to take place in the traditional months of June and July. .Last year, FIFA  confirmed that the World Cup will be moved to ‘cooler months’ and the final of the tournament will be played on December 18, Qatar’s national day. .Swiss authorities announced a criminal investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups last May,  the same day that US authorities indicted nine FIFA officials and five business executives on corruption charges. .The organisers have repeatedly denied all allegations of bribery and corruption during the bidding process."

Last year the government made promises to improve migrant labour rights in Qatar, but in practice, there have been no significant advances in the protection of rights.” .The report rated Qatar’s response to nine migrant labour rights issue, saying only “limited progress” had been made in five items while the authorities have “failed to make any improvements” in the other four. .“The lack of a clear roadmap of targets…leaves serious doubts about Qatar’s commitment to tackling migrant labour abuse,” said Qadri. .“[FIFA] has yet to demonstrate any real commitment to ensuring Qatar 2022 is not built on a foundation of exploitation and abuse,” he added. .Qatar disagrees .But Qatar’s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs said in a statement that “significant changes have been made over the last year to improve the rights and conditions of expatriate workers”. .“The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MOLSA) appreciates the work and effort involved in this latest report on the State of Qatar by Amnesty International, but we disagree with a number of its claims,” the statement said. .“No one should be in any doubt that we are committed to effective and sustainable change. MOLSA will continue working closely with NGOs, international organisations and the business community to deliver this commitment.” .The oil-rich nation unveiled proposed labour reforms one year ago including the replacement of a contentious sponsorship law, known as “kafala”, in which workers need their employer’s permission to change jobs. .It was also announced that an exit permit law requiring workers to obtain an employer’s consent to leave Qatar would also be reformed. However, Amnesty said there had been “no progress whatsoever” on these items. .Earlier this month Abdullah bin Saleh al-Khulaifi, the minister of labour and social affairs, said he was “90 percent” certain the kafala system would be replaced by the end of 2015. .He added that the wage protection system would be up and running by mid-August as well as improvements to workers’ accommodation."

gathering information on migrant workers’ accommodation.,".A journalist and crew from the British broadcaster BBC were detained in Qatar earlier this month while gathering information for a report on migrant workers. .Mark Lobel, the BBC journalist, has said that he and a cameraman, a translator and a driver were arrested in Doha while gathering additional material for a report on accommodation for low-paid migrant workers. .They spent two nights in jail and their equipment was confiscated. .Qatar has said the group was detained because they trespassed on private property, “which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries.” .The BBC crew had been invited to Doha by the Qatar government to see new accommodation provided for migrant workers, in a tour arranged by the Qatar World Cup organising committee, which answers to FIFA, the international body responsible for the organisation of football’s major international tournaments, notably the World Cup. .The Qatar government says “the press tour for reporters from the UK, Europe and the region … was designed to provide a better understanding of the challenges Qatar is facing – and the progress it is making – on the issue of migrant labour”. .Rights groups have criticised the working and housing conditions of labourers constructing new buildings in Qatar in the run-up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. .FIFA has said it will investigate the incident. .“Any instance relating to an apparent restriction of press freedom is of concern to FIFA and will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves,” FIFA said in a statement on Monday. .For his part, Lobel said in a story published by the BBC News website, the BBC team was en route to film a group of migrant workers on a quiet stretch of road in Doha when, “suddenly, eight white cars surrounded our vehicle and directed us on to a side road at speed”. .Lobel said he and his crew were frisked by security officers and taken to headquarters for questioning, before being transferred to a prison, where they spent two nights. .They were later allowed to join the organised press trip to which they had been invited. .Presence ‘no secret’ .In a statement, BBC said: “We are pleased that the BBC team has been released but we deplore the fact that they were detained in the first place. Their presence in Qatar was no secret and they were engaged in a perfectly proper piece of journalism.” .The BBC also requested a full explanation and the return of the crew’s equipment. .The Qatar government has said it had invited the reporters to see some substandard accommodation as well as some of the newer labour villages, and had arranged interviews with the minister of labour and social welfare and other authorities. .“Perhaps anticipating that the government would not provide this sort of access, the BBC crew decided to do their own site visits and interviews in the days leading up to the planned tour. In doing so, they trespassed on private property, which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries,” the statement said. .“The journalists who took part in the press tour were given an opportunity for a comprehensive look at the problems Qatar is facing and the progress the government and the private sector are making to address those problems.  .“They saw some of the worst labour villages and some of the best. The BBC was meant to be part of that tour and would have been if they had not chosen to break Qatari laws.” .The Qatar government statement continued: “Once the BBC reporter and his crew were released from detention, we tried to help them get the basic elements for the story they had missed.” .“While the full programme could not be duplicated, a separate one-on-one interview with the minister of labour and social welfare was arranged and they were able to tour a modern labour village. .“By trespassing on private property and running afoul of Qatari laws, the BBC reporter made himself the story. We sincerely hope that this was not his intention. Moreover, we deeply regret that he was unable to report the real story, which is that the government and the private sector are making significant progress in efforts to improve the lives and the labour conditions of guest workers in Qatar.”"
