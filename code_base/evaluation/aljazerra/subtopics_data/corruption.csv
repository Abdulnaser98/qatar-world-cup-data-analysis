Qatar 2022 football world cup organisers, claims he was targeted for his stance towards migrant workers.",".Doha, Qatar – The court of appeal in Qatar has upheld a guilty verdict handed out to a former 2022 FIFA World Cup official for bribery and misuse of funds but reduced his prison sentence from five years to three years. .Abdullah Ibhais, a former media manager at the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), the body delivering next year’s World Cup, was arrested in 2019 and sentenced to five years in April 2021. .He was released pending appeal but was arrested again last month before launching a hunger strike “as a final resort” to clear his name and “demand a fair trial”. .Ibhais, a Jordanian national, claimed he was targeted for speaking out in favour of migrant workers who went on strike in August 2019. The SC, however, rejected those claims and termed them “ludicrous, defamatory, and absolutely false”. .“Misappropriation of state funds is a serious crime in Qatar, and this is reflected in the court’s decision,” said a Qatari official, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera following the appeal hearing on Wednesday. .“The case of Mr Ibhais followed all the proper legal procedures and protocols. Mr Ibhais was convicted following the careful examination of an abundance of strong and credible evidence against him for soliciting bribes to influence the outcome of a state-funded procurement process.” .Ziyad, Ibhais’s brother, told Al Jazeera that the family was “planning to appeal, although we have very little faith in the Qatari so-called legal system”. .Ibhais was not present in the court when the judge upheld the guilty verdict on Wednesday. .His family told Al Jazeera in a statement that Ibhais’s absence was “meant to deprive Abdullah from being seen with the effects of hunger strike apparent on his body … this is a part of the continuous attempts to silence Abdullah”. .In 2019, the SC launched the investigation after a complaint was received “from a third-party participant in a tender for the award of a contract related to the management of social media platforms on behalf of the SC”. .“The complaint was supported with audio and visual documentary evidence,” the SC statement added. .SC officials told Al Jazeera that following the investigation “a number of SC employees were issued with written warnings” while two, including Ibhais, were suspended. .Ibhais’s family claimed that neither any evidence nor the internal investigation was produced in court hearings, adding that his earlier requests to view documents and charges against him were repeatedly denied. .However, the SC said the evidence and documents were handed over to “relevant public authorities for further investigation” which also marked the stage where “SC’s involvement in the case ended”. .Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers and its human rights record have been under the spotlight since it was awarded the hosting of the 2022 World Cup. .While the Kafala system, which tied down a worker to a private sponsor, was abolished in a landmark ruling last year, workers in the country have still complained of facing problems, including false absconding cases and non-payment of salaries, while attempting to switch employers. .In August 2019, about 5,000 construction workers went on a strike citing unpaid salaries and poor working conditions, including workers who had previously worked on two World Cup stadiums. .While reporting on the strike, Al Jazeera spoke to protesting workers who said that in addition to poor living conditions, they had not been paid for up to four months, the companies had failed to renew their work permits – making their status in Qatar illegal – and were not given the required letters that would allow them to switch employers. .Leaked WhatsApp conversations on an SC “Crisis Comms” group, published by Norwegian website Josimar, showed discussions taking place among SC officials on how to handle media coverage of the strike. .The conversations, confirmed to Al Jazeera to be authentic by the SC, showed Ibhais showing apprehension following suggestions that SC denies any World Cup workers were involved in the strike. .In the group, Ibhais said he visited the workers along with a colleague and confirmed World Cup workers were also affected. .“We need to fix and then do the PR part,” he was seen saying in a separate conversation with Fatima al-Nuaimi, communications executive director at the SC. .In a voice note on the group, Hasan al-Thawadi, secretary-general at the SC, was heard telling the “comms and workers welfare” departments to “come up with a narrative to clarify and explain on how we address this situation, to clarify and explain we have taken steps beyond any other institution, any other organisations to ensure speedy payments for workers”, Josimar reported. .“That needs to be clarified, figure it out, if it’s a delay of a month, then put a narrative on it, put a spin on it,” he was heard saying. .Ibhais claims that the internal investigation launched weeks later was due to his stance on the strike and the affected workers. .His family told Al Jazeera that following the investigation, Ibhais was arrested from the office by state security, adding that he was denied legal assistance while in detention. .“When he asked for a lawyer, he was told ‘we will break the leg of any lawyer who enters this building’,” his family claimed. .However, a Qatari official said Ibhais “received legal advice and representation throughout the process in accordance with Qatar’s laws”. .Ziyad added that “faced with the prospect of not being able to see his family and threatened with force, Ibhais confessed to something he didn’t do”. .“He said he was trying to take bribe in return to awarding a tender but then changed his mind. The tender was not awarded in the end. He’s facing all this for a crime that did not take place.” .The SC has said Ibhais’s allegations following his conviction and sentencing that “the SC conspired against him because of his views on migrant workers are ludicrous, defamatory, and absolutely false”. .“The SC’s work culture promotes and encourages staff raising issues and grievances, and particularly on the subject in question (Workers’ welfare).” .In a joint statement released earlier this month, Fair Square and Human Rights Watch said that  “an analysis of a Qatari police report and witness statements show that the SC handed over highly sensitive and apparently unsubstantiated and vague allegations that Ibhais was engaged in activities aimed at ‘harming the state or its security’.” .The statement added that Ibhais told the two organisations in September that “interrogators used the subsequent initiation of a State Security investigation to coerce him into confessing to the lesser charge of bribery and misuse of state funds”. .“Increasingly it appears that Abdullah Ibhais is in jail because of suspicion and paranoia, not any evidence of wrongdoing,” Nick McGeehan, director of FairSquare, said in a statement."

The indictment, published by a federal court in Brooklyn, accuses media rights handlers and a company from Uruguay of wire fraud and money laundering among other allegations. .According to the prosecutors, representatives working for Russia and Qatar bribed FIFA executive committee officials to swing votes in the crucial hosting decisions of world football’s governing body. .“Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy [organisers of World Cup 2022] strongly denies the allegations contained within the court papers made public in the US on 6 April 2020,” it said in a statement sent to Al Jazeera on Tuesday. .“They are part of a long-standing case, the subject of which is not the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. Despite years of false claims, evidence has never been produced to demonstrate that Qatar won the rights to host the FIFA World Cup 2022 unethically or by means that contravened FIFA’s strict bidding rules. .“The SC maintains that it strictly adhered to all rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process and any claim to the contrary is baseless and will be fiercely contested.” .In a statement, FIFA, world football’s governing body, said it supported all investigations into “alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing” and noted it had been accorded victim status in the US criminal proceedings. .“The FIFA Ethics Committee has already imposed sanctions, including life bans, on football officials mentioned in this process,” said a FIFA spokesman. .“As far as FIFA is concerned, should any acts of criminal wrongdoing by football officials be established, the individuals in question should be subject to penal sanctions.” .The indictment states that the three South American members of FIFA’s 2010 executive – Brazil’s Ricardo Teixeira, the late Nicolas Leoz of Paraguay and an unnamed co-conspirator – took bribes to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 tournament."

His counsel William Bourdon insisted Platini had not been arrested but rather underwent “a hearing as a witness in the context desired by the investigators”. .Platini was suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in 2015 for receiving a “disloyal payment” of $2m from then-FIFA President Joseph Blatter. .Platini is one of France’s most famous sportsmen and football stars. He led France to victory in the 1984 European Championship and played in two World Cup semi-finals."

Qatar has denied the allegations.  .Several blockading countries have launched well-funded media campaigns targeting Qatar.  .A French news website recently reported the FBI in the United States and Brazilian prosecutors were investigating an alleged transfer of $22m from the Gulf state to the former chairman of Brasil’s Football Federation, days after Qatar was awarded the tournament. .The investigation into alleged bribery of FIFA officials started in 2015 and is still ongoing. .“I am not aware of this investigation by the FBI. As far as we are concerned, the FIFA case is closed,” said Marri. .Speaking to Al Jazeera, Marri said he had a mandate from the Qatari leadership to fully cooperate with foreign investigators. .“Qatar is a state of law,” said the attorney-general. “On our side, we remain fully cooperative with international authorities who may wish to approach us to discuss these cases. However, we haven’t received any requests for cooperation so far.” .On November 27, the former president of Colombia’s soccer federation, Louis Bedoya,  testified in a court hearing in New York City that a sports marketing executive told him up to $15m in bribe money was available for South American officials from Qatar ahead of the FIFA executive committee vote for the 2022 World Cup. .Bedoya, also a former member of the FIFA executive committee, was testifying in the trial of three former South American football officials, with whom he said he discussed potential bribes during a conversation with an intermediary in Madrid in 2010. .In 2016, Bedoya pled guilty to corruption charges and was handed a lifetime ban from the FIFA Ethics Committee. .“We cannot pass a judgment [on Qatar] as court hearings in New York are still ongoing,” said Eduardo Vetere, vice president of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities based in Vienna. “We have to wait [for] the conclusion of the trials.”"

governing body held in Zurich as part of double investigation.,".The US is seeking to extradite seven officials of FIFA, world football’s governing body, who have been arrested in Switzerland for conspiracy and corruption. .The officials, arrested by Swiss authorities in Zurich on Wednesday, are among 14 people named in a 47-count indictment that was unsealed in federal court in New York City. .The arrested include a Jeffrey Webb, FIFA vice-president, and Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice-president. .The 14 officials and executives were charged over a bribery and kickback scheme involving $150m that spanned a 24-year period. . .The officials were in Zurich for the FIFA Congress, which is scheduled to elect a new president on Friday. .FIFA has confirmed that Sepp Blatter, the current president who is seeking a fifth term in the office, has not been arrested. .“FIFA executives and others corrupted the process, they did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament,” Loretta Lynch, US attorney general, announced at a news conference in New York on Wednesday. .US officials revealed that the 2010 World Cup, the first time Africa hosted the global event, was awarded to South Africa based on bribes received by some FIFA officials. .Separate from the US indictment, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) issued a statement on Wednesday saying it had “opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 Football World Cups”. .Documents seized .OAG said it had seized data and documents from FIFA’s IT systems as part of its investigation. .“It is suspected that irregularities occurred in the allocation of the FIFA World Cups of 2018 and 2022,” the OAG statement said. .“The OAG and the Swiss Federal Criminal Police will be questioning 10 persons who took part in voting on the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as members of the Executive Committee in 2010.” .However, a FIFA spokesperson maintained on Wednesday that the two World Cups were scheduled to go ahead as planned – in Russia and Qatar. .Last November, just hours after a FIFA judge cleared Russia and Qatar of corruption in their winning World Cup bids, American lawyer Michael Garcia, who led the investigation, said he would appeal the decision to close the case because it was based on “materially incomplete and erroneous” information. .FIFA confirmed after Wednesday’s arrests that the meeting in Zurich and the elections would go ahead as planned. .Blatter is widely tipped to be re-elected. .Jordan’s Prince Ali al-Hussein is the only person standing against Blatter following the late withdrawal of Portugal’s Luis Figo and Dutch Michael van Praag. .“One thing [arrests] has nothing to do with the other and the election will take place as planned,” Walter de Gregorio, FIFA spokesperson, said. .He called the arrests a “difficult moment” but said it would not derail Blatter’s re-election bid. .He said that Blatter was “not dancing in his office” following the arrests but remained “calm” and was prepared to cooperate fully with investigators. .Gregorio confirmed that while “it was a difficult moment” for football’s governing body and that it was “the damaged party”, FIFA welcomed the investigation process and would cooperate fully with the authorities. .“FIFA initiated this process last November when it lodged a complaint with the federal attorney,” Gregorio said. .“We provided all the information requested by them, including the Garcia report, as this is all in our own interest. .“FIFA is suffering under the circumstances and it’s certainly a difficult moment for us.” .In New York, meanwhile, Kelly Currie, the acting US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, confirmed that it was “the beginning of our efforts, not the end”. .“This sort of bribery in football has been going on for decades,” he said. .“Jeffery Webb used his position in various roles, a position of trust to solicit and collect bribe from sports marketing executives who needed his support to get contracts.” .Lynch, the US attorney general, said that extradition of the defendants to the US will be the next step, adding that the authorities were “trying to apprehend the remaining defendants”."

But aspire to deliver it – doing it voluntarily however tough the path is – and it can do wonders to the reputation of an individual or organisation. .But does Fifa realise this? .We were on sadly familiar ground when we returned to Zurich for another Executive Committee meeting. The agenda doesn’t even reflect the big issue, as so often in the past. Not so much an ‘elephant in the room’ as the entire Zurich zoo (located next door) at Fifa HQ – the world cup bidding corruption report. .If Fifa wants to somehow, finally, restore its reputation and shift the spotlight to some of the good work and good people at the organisation, this is the time to bury the ghosts. Not next year, not in 2018 or 2022 but now. .Can the world governing body not really see what the public thinks of the delivery of this corruption report? And the assertion that it will not be made public? .The report is like a hot potato being thrown around. For those seeking the truth, it is like being kept on hold then passed around a call centre. .Garcia’s desire .Everyone is playing by the rules but why are these rules in place? .Michael Garcia’s role was of an investigator. A thankless task when so many of the corrupt figures from the Executive Committee resigned before properly facing the music. .Garcia, to his credit, wants the report made public. But his powers ceased when he handed it to the FIFA Ethics Committee, specifically Judge Eckert. .No one is questioning his right to take his time pouring over thousands of details before coming to his conclusions. But this is where things start to get unsatisfactory for those demanding transparency. .A simple question: does Eckert have the power to act against bidding nations? Or more pertinently, hosting nations. Could he change the outcome? .“That is not our job,” Eckert said when explaining his powers, or supposed lack of, at FIFA HQ. “We will not make any recommendations.” .Questions asked of FIFA .You don’t need a long memory to recall this same Ethics Committee handing out a succession of lifetime bans, with the notorious 2011 presidential election at the core of the corruption. .But this was about individuals. With individuals, the Ethics Committee does have powers. How convenient for Fifa, some might conclude, that its independent Committee can’t tackle bid committees. .And if Eckert cannot act, who can? This will end up back at the FIFA Executive Committee… spring of 2015 at the earliest. .Now does FIFA seriously consider this acceptable? Is it acceptable to them even? .But the question of reputation is a subtle one. They have a ‘problem with communications’ that needs addressing urgently. .Is this my accusation? Absolutely the contrary. There are smart, clever, likeable, underrated people quietly working wonders in their communications department. . .This is the verdict delivered by Fifa’s VP Jeffrey Webb and Michel D’Hooghe at the Soccerex event in Manchester earlier this month. .This is not about people or a department. This is about transparency of an organisation and confusing messages coming from the top. .No one can stop Blatter holding an Ethics Conference at FIFA HQ, which is rather like Manchester United and Van Gaal holding a seminar on defensive excellence in September. And no one can stop him saying Fifa is transparent. .But Mr Blatter, please, we beg of you, if you are reading this, do not treat the public like idiots. .I’ve defended you on-air when imperfect English mangled a message. That’s not a crime but don’t even try the transparency claim. The only transparent thing at Fifa is the glass in the lifts. .If it suits you politically, for 2018 and 2022 controversy rumble on indefinitely, consider the reputation all damage each passing day. .This, sir, is your big opportunity. Demand transparency. Challenge the rules in your own house and publish the report. .This column was first published on Inside World Football where Lee Wellings represents Al Jazeera."
