Wouldnt it be great if they were compensated for it?
Just metres away, hundreds of young men board flights to Qatar and other Gulf states every day, hoping to earn enough to look after the families they leave behind. About 400,000 Nepalis work in Qatar and many toiled for years on its preparations for the World Cup.
For some the deal has worked out. They earned a regular if low wage, which meant they could afford to send their children to better schools, buy land or rebuild their house. For others, the World Cup has left a bitter legacy.
Millions celebrated Argentinas victory at the Lusail stadium on Sunday, but not Thagendra Adhikari. The stadium is very beautiful. Its well designed. But I have a lot of bad memories from there, says Adhikari, who spent more than two years helping to construct the 80,000-seat arena. Whenever I see that stadium on the screen, I feel bad. I was abused and exploited there. I, and many workers, received unfair wages. I love football, but I still cant forget my dark days in Qatar.
Adhikari says he was forced to pay 115,000 rupees (£715) to a recruitment agent in Nepal to secure his job, which left him mired in debt. He says the agent promised a salary of 1,200 rials (£270) a month but he was only paid 750 rials (£170), forcing him to put in countless hours of overtime to make up the difference.
I like football, Im a big Lionel Messi fan, but this World Cup hasnt touched my heart because thousands of workers like me in Qatar were not treated well, says Adhikari. We workers have shed blood, sweat and tears to make the World Cup happen, but we werent paid properly for it.

Naresh Shrestha, a construction manager who also worked on Lusail stadium, has a very different view. I am proud that I was part of the construction of that iconic stadium. The Nepali team [of workers] did very well, he says. The World Cup has very much improved working conditions in Qatar. Some rules were changed to benefit workers. Its very good now.
But there is often a huge gap between the experience of skilled professionals like Shrestha, and low-wage workers like Bipin Magar*.
When Magar set out for Qatar in 2021, he expected to be there for at least two years. Already in debt in Nepal, he says he took out more loans to pay a recruitment agent about 135,000 rupees (£840) for the job in Qatar. He spent eight months working on Stadium 974, the temporary arena that won praise for its innovative design, before he was suddenly sent home. Thousands of other low-wage workers, like Magar, were sent back against their wishes, and often still in debt, as companies were ordered to wrap up construction projects before the start of the World Cup.
Magar is caught in a spiral of debt, and has now returned to Qatar  once again paying his own way  in a desperate attempt to repay what he owes. He has bad recollections of his time working on the stadium. He says whenever the local World Cup organising committee came for inspections his employer would tell them not to say anything negative. Only the workers who were not likely to raise problems were put in front of the inspectors.
However, now back in Qatar, he is working on other constructions projects under far worse conditions. Weve had to work in extreme temperatures, but we didnt have easy access to water. At first, I didnt even have a bed or pillow. We would sleep on the floor. Workers like me have it tough, says Magar.
Despite playing a part in constructing the stadiums, Magar found no joy in watching the matches. My friends enjoyed the games, but I couldnt. When you go through financial problems, its very difficult to be find happiness in this type of thing. I have my own problems to focus on, he says. Nothing works out as you expect here.

delegation from the three host countries of the 2026 World Cup  Canada, Mexico and the United States  met with dignitaries in the coastal city of Doha to hand over responsibility for the 2026 edition of the tournament.
The delegation, represented by Canadas transport minister Omar Alghabra, US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Mexican Football Federation president Yon de Luisa, were photographed receiving a ceremonial ball from Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani, president of the Qatar Olympic Committee. The symbolic gesture signaled the closing stages of one of the most controversial sporting events in modern history  an event marked by show-stopping soccer, appalling human rights abuses, and dystopian displays of wealth and luxury.
And despite accusations of bribery, abuses of migrant workers, and the criminalization of same-sex relationships, the wealthy Gulf peninsula succeeded in hosting the worlds most popular sporting event, culminating in a thrilling match between France and Argentina that will be remembered as one of the best tournament finals in decades.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Now, following back-to-back World Cups hosted by autocratic regimes in Russia and Qatar, the 2026 edition will signal the quadrennial tournaments return to democratic nations for the first time since 2014. While this may be a cause for relief and celebration for some, it is vital that sports journalists continue to apply the same critical lens theyve applied to Qatar to other host countries.
For years, journalists at the Guardian, among others, have been at the forefront of reporting on the intersection of politics at the World Cup in Qatar. From investigative pieces uncovering the exploitation of migrant workers and the resulting death toll to thoughtful pieces reflecting on the ways authoritarian states stand to benefit from hosting prestigious sports events, the reportage has helped breathe new life into sports journalism, rightfully demanding that reporters expand their coverage beyond what takes place on the pitch.
However, the work should not end there.
While it was easy to find fault in Qatar given its autocratic nature and well-documented human rights abuses, it is essential that those same journalists approach all future international sports events, including those in the Western world, with a similar critical lens in order to avoid the perception of hypocrisy, orientalism and journalistic posturing.
For example, the 2024 edition of the Uefa European Championships is scheduled to take place in Germany, a country that is currently in the midst of a socio-economic and energy crisis. Germany has also seen a rise in far-right extremism with nearly 24,000 far-right crimes recorded by police in 2020 alone. Official government reports have also found more than 300 cases of far-right extremism in Germanys top security agencies, further emphasizing the problem.
Looking ahead to the 2026 World Cup  a tournament spanning 16 cities across three countries  there is no shortage of concerns worthy of critical journalism. The vast majority of the games will take place in the United States, a country that has withstood a tempestuous few years marred with an attempted insurrection, a marked increase in mass shootings, longstanding racial injustice towards Black Americans and people of color, and increasing legal regulation of gender minorities, including women and transpersons. Surely those subjects warrant coverage in the context of the 2026 World Cup.
It is also worth noting that while a portion of the critical coverage of this years World Cup shed light on Qatars criminalization of homosexuality, we, as journalists, would be remiss not to mention that the United States has seen a significant increase in attacks on the LGBTQ+ community. Back in May, US president Joe Biden warned of disturbing setbacks and rising hate and violence targeting LGBTQ+ peoples. Bidens warning came amidst a slew of anti-LGBTQ+ bills being introduced in state legislature throughout the country, and only months before a mass shooting occurred at a LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs left five people dead.
Meanwhile, under a new directive from Texas governor Greg Abbott, families with trans kids are fleeing the state after facing child abuse investigations for providing gender-affirming care.
The United States is also not above criticism when it comes to the role the country plays in propping up authoritarian regimes around the world. This includes Qatar, a country that hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East and which Biden officially designated as a major non-Nato ally in a presidential declaration. The US even approved a $1bn arms deal with Qatar during the US mens national team World Cup match against Iran  an incident that went sorely underreported.
North of the border in Canada, the situation is not much better. The second-largest nation in the world is currently reckoning with its colonial past and its systemic intergenerational oppression of Indigenous peoples, including the notorious residential school system, which involved the Canadian state forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families and communities and sequestering them in residential schools usually thousands of miles away from their home. These schools were rife with physical, sexual and emotional abuse, and have been described as sites of cultural genocide. The last of these schools was shut down in 1996.
In May 2021, a mass grave of 215 children was found at a residential school in British Columbia, one of the two provinces that will host matches at the 2026 World Cup. And despite its stated commitment to reconciliation, the Canadian government is yet to label its past treatment of Indigenous people as genocide.
Canada is also under scrutiny for its treatment of migrant workers under the countrys Temporary Foreign Worker program. Recent reports suggest that workers are poorly paid and abused while also being denied the rights afforded to Canadian residents and citizens. After years of reporting on Qatars migrant workers crisis, many sports journalists should now be adequately equipped to apply their skills to other societal contexts, including the West.
There are countless examples of concerns worthy of extensive reporting ahead of the 2026 tri-nation World Cup. And while each of the three host countries has repeatedly restated its commitment to human rights and democratic freedoms, it is crucial that sports journalists continue to hold their governments accountable. This is especially true as sports continue to have significant geo-political and socio-economic influence.
Over the past decade, I have made a career of reporting on the intersection of sports and politics around the world. My reporting spans more than two dozen countries in six continents, covering everything from the beautiful game to the sweet science. Consequently, that experience has helped shape my understanding of the role that sports play in the modern political landscape. However, the most recent edition of the World Cup was the first time I felt the topic was part of a prevailing narrative rather than a one of niche consideration. I would like to believe that this profound shift is not a temporary one and that we will not return to the worn-out cliché of keeping sports out of politics.
If we want the legacy of this World Cup to be a watershed moment in how we report on the intersection of sports and politics, it is vital that journalists continue to reflect and report on that intersection at the next World Cup and other future global sports events in democratic countries.
We have crossed the Rubicon. There is no turning back now."

But Great Britain has no moral or legal high ground here.
In its most recent (2021-22) statistics, the enforcement agency, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), recorded 123 worker fatalities alongside 80 work-related fatal injuries to members of the public. It also published an estimate of 13,000 deaths as a result of work-related ill health. Other data  for example, from the UN or the Hazards Campaign  estimates total deaths caused by work at between 37,000 and 61,000, each year, every year. Yet these attract virtually no enforcement (let alone media or political) response.
While the HSE does not break down enforcement data by fatality distinct from other outcomes of violations of law  the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is a criminal statute  it does publish the fact that in 2020-21 it secured a grand total of 185 convictions for all offences. Convictions have been in freefall since 2010, when there were 730, even if the latter figure is a pinprick in the context of tens of thousands of deaths. Such data bears witness to an old trade union adage  if you want to kill someone and get away with it, first set up a company, then employ them. Steve TombsEmeritus professor, Open University
While much has rightly been made of Qatars record on LGBT rights and the exploitation of migrant workers, as well as the corrupt fashion in which the tournament was awarded, there were some good things about holding it there. One of them was the massive attendance of fans from African countries such as Senegal and Morocco, who made the competition the spectacle it was. If the World Cup had been held in the UK or in other European countries, many of those fans would not have been admitted because of exclusionary immigration policies.
In future, perhaps the World Cup should only be held in places that are both human rights-compliant and where people from all over the world can freely attend.Christopher BertramProfessor emeritus, University of Bristol

But Qatar is not the victim,"When Nasser al-Khater, Qatars World Cup chief, was asked two weeks ago about the recent death of a migrant worker, his response was both shocking and revealing. Were in the middle of a World Cup and we have a successful World Cup. And this is something you want to talk about right now? I mean death is a natural part of life, he said, before going on to offer condolences to the family of the deceased.
First, a sense of outrage and indignation that anyone would challenge Qatars narrative about the World Cup and then a callous indifference for the workers who made it possible.
In recent weeks, that outrage, stoked by the Qatari authorities, has been seen in numerous articles calling western criticism of Qatars human rights record racist, hypocritical and orientalist.
Most chillingly, we have seen Qatars talking points repeated by Eva Kaili  at the time a vice-president of the European parliament  who was charged along with three others last week, in connection with allegations that Qatar used gifts and cash to influence decision-making. Kaili and Qatar deny any wrongdoing.
The World Cup in Qatar is proof, actually, of how sports diplomacy can achieve a historic transformation of a country  [the International Labour Organization] said that Qatar is a frontrunner in labour rights, said Kaili in a debate on the countrys human rights record the day after the World Cup kicked off. Still some here are calling to discriminate them, they bully them and they accuse everyone that talks to them or engages of corruption.
And yet it is the second part of Khaters response that explains much of the criticism. The casual dismissal of a workers death illustrates what I have seen time and again in almost a decade of reporting on the treatment of Qatars low-wage migrant workers  that for the most part, the Qatari authorities just dont appear to care.
The real scandal of this World Cup is not that the criticism of Qatar is racially motivated, but that the men who built this tournament have been subjected to a labour system based largely on racial discrimination.
That was clear to the former UN special rapporteur on racism, Tendayi Achiume, who in 2020 released a damning report highlighting serious concerns of structural racial discrimination against non-nationals. Achiume said a de facto caste system based on national origin exists in Qatar, according to which European, North American, Australian and Arab nationalities systematically enjoy greater human rights protections than south Asian and sub-Saharan African nationalities.
This discrimination is embedded in family housing only zoning regulations that effectively prohibit most migrant workers from living in certain parts of the country and has played out for all to see when low-wage workers have been barred from entering some parks, shopping malls and public spaces.
It is evident in the different wages paid to different nationalities  Nepalis and Bangladeshis are often paid less than Indians or Filipinos for doing the same work, for example. A recent report by human rights group Equidem found that almost half the workers interviewed who were employed on World Cup stadiums reported nationality-based discrimination.
And it is most obvious simply in the way low-wage workers are treated. Twelve years after Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, tens of thousands of workers remain housed in appalling accommodation and are still forced to pay extortionate recruitment fees for their jobs, often in return for a basic wage that equates to just £1 an hour.
Wage theft appears rampant and arguably got worse in the months leading up to the World Cup, when thousands of workers were sent home, many still in debt, as companies wrapped up construction projects.
The Qatari government has said it has taken wide-ranging actions to create safe conditions for its migrant workers and regulations have been put in place to limit labourers exposuer to the searing summer heat. But the authorities have done little to investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers, and countless families have been left without answers or compensation from their loved ones employers. As Nirmala Pakrin, the widow of a worker who died while employed on a World Cup stadium, said to me recently: They are making millions  [so] why cant they even give us a little compensation?

Geoffrey Otieno, a Kenyan worker who was detained in Qatar for speaking out on workers rights, recently wrote about how incensed he was by attempts to dismiss criticism of the treatment of migrant workers as racist, saying: As a black African worker who made the 2022 World Cup possible, nothing  including the abuses to which I was subjected, and those that I witnessed  has been more infuriating  In Qatar, migrant workers are an expendable commodity.
Qatar, and its supporters, argue that the country has introduced meaningful reforms, chiefly the dismantling of the abusive kafala system and the introduction of a minimum wage. But these only came into force 10 years after Qatar won the right to host the World Cup. And on the ground, little seems to have changed. The stories I heard from workers in Qatar last month are almost the same as those I heard when I began my reporting in 2013.
It would be oversimplistic to say exploitation in Qatars labour system is based solely on race. Like everywhere, race, class and the profit motive combine to marginalise the most vulnerable. But Qatars unique population  95% of the workforce is from overseas  its vast wealth and the attention it sought by hosting the World Cup have exposed and amplified these divisions.
The Qatari authorities are not solely to blame. The day-to-day abuses endured by many low-wage workers are mostly meted out by other migrant workers, typically  according to many workers I have spoken to  managers from India and Egypt. As one worker told me: The Qatari people are very good, but they have left the country in the hands of people who dont value human beings.
Responsibility also lies with powerful Qatari business owners who appear to be untouchable. Its a hierarchical system here where no one lower would dare try to do something against someone higher than them, a construction manager with years of experience in Qatar told me, by way of explaining how influential Qataris can act with impunity.
And then there is Fifa, and scores of foreign companies and individuals who seem to have turned a blind eye while pocketing enormous profits and salaries. A 2018 British government press release claimed British firms were likely to secure deals worth £1.5bn in the run-up to the tournament. Fifa earned a record $7.5bn in the four-year cycle leading up to this World Cup and yet has still failed to agree to a fund to compensate workers who have suffered and the families of those who have died.
Ultimately the responsibility to protect migrant workers lies with governments, and by that standard the Qatari authorities have largely failed. To call this out is not racist, its anti-racist."

It was admitted that between 400 and 500 may have died working on infrastructure projects during that period. The actual figure could be far higher and may never be known. Notoriously, the Qatari authorities have not bothered to do the work necessary to come up with an exact number.
This Sunday, with a memorable France v Argentina final in prospect, those workers and their families need to be remembered too. Fifa, footballs governing body, continues to ignore calls for a dedicated compensation fund for the migrants killed or injured in Qatar. It should think again. There is still time to make some partial amends for the mistake made in 2010 when  after a deeply suspect bidding process  Fifa awarded the World Cup to a super-rich oil state with a poor human rights record and draconian anti-gay laws.
During the tournament, Fifa has responded to protests by outlawing displays of defiance such as the wearing of rainbow armbands by players. But suggesting that politics should be kept off the pitch  as Arsène Wenger, now a Fifa technical director, regrettably chose to do  makes no sense at all. It was a particularly unprincipled instance of political powerplay (and alleged corruption) which created the sporting problem in the first place. Players such as Englands captain, Harry Kane, threatened with on-field sanctions if he wore the armband, were placed in an invidious position by those who run the game.
As the weeks have passed, the football and the compelling narratives it has generated have taken centre stage. So much has been fabulous to watch. At 35, Lionel Messi has scintillated and astounded, dragging an average team to the brink of glory. He stands within touching distance of a World Cup winners medal to complete arguably the greatest career in football history. Romantics will be on Messis side on Sunday.
This was the first edition of the tournament to be held in the Middle East  in itself a hugely welcome development. It tilted footballs centre of gravity away from Europe and towards the global south in exhilarating fashion. For the first time, all five African sides competing won at least one game. The fans of Ghana, Senegal and Cameroon  along with their Argentinian and Welsh counterparts  were stars in their own right, filling stadiums and Dohas new metro with marvellous colour and noise. And then there was Morocco. The first African and Arab team to reach a World Cup semi-final were both a revelation and a source of continental and cultural pride. The Atlas Lions were passionately backed in cafes and squares from Dakar to Gaza. The sight of the Moroccan winger Sofiane Boufal dancing with his mother on the pitch, after the teams quarter-final victory against Portugal, moved millions.
Sportswashing is only an option because sport  and particularly football  can fire the imagination of people and nations through these kind of moments. Association with something so uplifting and unifying, so suggestive of a global community celebrating its diversity, is a good look. By spending a record $220bn, tiny Qatar sought to position itself as the best friend of the worlds favourite game. But it should not have been given the chance.
Advocates of engagement will point fairly to labour market reforms introduced as union organisations and NGOs shone a spotlight on the abuse of migrant workers. But those 400-500 admitted deaths will shadow all future reflections on this tournament. It was a great World Cup, but its drama unfolded in the wrong place. To subvert and repurpose Bill Shanklys famous joke: football is not more important than matters of life and death."

Instead, newspapers found themselves being contacted by Britons such as George Pascoe?Watson, a former political editor of the Sun, challenging the premise of their story and offering a more pro-Qatari viewpoint.
Pascoe-Watson is a senior partner at Portland, a high-end London-based public relations and lobbying company founded by Tim Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair. It is one of many British?based firms who benefited from spinning on behalf of the Qatari government before the World Cup, pushing the Gulf nations case in the media, and arguing against negative coverage.
Because while England once again failed to win the World Cup, Londons lobbyists and lawyers working on the competition have done their best to ensure a fortunes coming home.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws.

Theres been a very well?organised and well-resourced campaign in place, said Nicholas McGeehan, a longtime campaigner on migrant workers rights in the region. Arguments have been constructed very effectively to deflect attention from fair and proportionate criticism.
One of the reasons for the heavy presence of British PR representatives is that criticism of Qatars bid  whether the alleged corruption (denied by Qatar) involved in securing the hosting rights, the treatment of migrant workers, or its lack of LGBTQ+ rights  has been led by UK newspapers such as the Guardian and the Sunday Times. While German and Scandinavian news outlets have also investigated these issues, it is the English-language media which are easier to read around the world.
Portland declined to comment on the nature of its work in Qatar, although it has an office in Doha and has been working on various Qatari-related contracts since at least 2014. Early challenges included dealing with the detention of a BBC journalist in the country and helping to set up a blog that criticised opponents of the country hosting the tournament. But as time progressed, journalists reporting on the World Cup preparations said the efforts to improve Qatars image in the British press became smarter and more subtle.
In particular, they receive pushback from representatives of Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the World Cups organising committee. He is a Qatari national who attended sixth-form college in Scunthorpe before studying law at the University of Sheffield and is said to take British criticism personally. One British reporter who has dealt with Thawadi claimed: Hes absolutely convinced that hes this liberal guy who really cares about workers rights and conditions. Hes mortified that the world would think of him as just another uncaring Qatari. He phones his PR people in fury each time theres a negative headline about whats happening in Qatar being down to him. And he may be less worse than the vast majority of the Qatari elite, because they dont care about migrant workers.
With UK newspapers often uploading their stories to their websites around midnight, newsdesks became used to Qataris on a different time zone waking up in the early hours of the morning and demanding alterations.
One Briton who played an important role in the World Cup press operation is Richard Conway, who as a BBC Sport correspondent in 2018 produced an upbeat report on the preparations for the Qatar World Cup while riding a camel across the desert. A few months later he left journalism to form his own PR agency and has been working exclusively on the Qatar World Cup for several years. Journalists who have dealt with him say he has adopted a hands-off approach, acting as an informal conduit and enabling conversations by inviting critics of the World Cup and prominent newspaper journalists to off-the-record meetings with senior Qatari officials at London hotels.
Many Britons also work for the Qatari division of Teneo Blue Rubicon, a PR agency that has worked hard to promote the country, while journalists who have written critically about the country have also received legal letters from the law firm Carter Ruck. Neither company returned a request for comment on the nature of their work in the country.

One of the gripes among Qatari officials is that they have received criticism for adopting similar tactics to regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Guardian has previously reported on extravagantly funded events held in London where MPs and former footballers received large fees from an unknown source, all with the intention of building opposition to the Qatar World Cup. The organiser of that event also approached the former Conservative election chief Sir Lynton Crosby  whose company already conducted work for Saudi Arabia  and discussed a £5.5m influence campaign to strip Qatar of the right to host the World Cup.
Those nations also spent tens of millions of pounds on lobbying campaigners aimed at western politicians and media outlets, with Qatar feeling they had the right to fight fire with fire.
Despite this, theres little doubt among Qatars critics that the decision to host the World Cup has ultimately transformed the countrys global standing in the media. Low expectations and ethical concerns were ultimately dialled down in media coverage as the football began. Paid influencers have flooded TikTok with upbeat stories from Doha.
And according to McGeehan, who now runs the FairSquare NGO, one of the most effective tactics during the tournament has been to argue that criticism of Qatar is Orientalism, or anti-Arab: A good PR person understands how that is going to play well with particular audiences who are sensitive to charges like that. It led to people who would normally be considered as allies in this to essentially engage in the counter-debate, rather than the debate what the issues are."

With the month-long tournament ending on Sunday when Argentina play France in the final, the failure of Fifa and football associations to deliver positive change for workers has been decried this week by a number of charities and NGOs.
Now the international players union Fifpro, the Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) have taken action into their own hands by developing a digital platform to provide employment support. They call it to date the only initiative made by and for the migrant workers and say it follows consultations with as many as 1,000 individuals.

As part of a shared vision over the last few years, [we] have been seeking ways to help ensure a positive and sustainable impact for communities and people involved in the delivery of major football events, the unions said in a joint statement. As it stands [our] call for better implementation and monitoring of recent labour reforms and the establishment of a Migrant Workers Centre in Qatar remains unanswered.
With the Fifa World Cup coming to a close on 18 December, International Migrants Day, Fifpro, BWI and IDWF remain committed to supporting the advancement of migrant workers rights and conditions.

With workers in Qatar unable to organise their labour, and information commonly denied them by employers, there is little awareness of what rights are available to workers and how recent changes in employment law, including the abolition of the kafala system, has affected them. The app will attempt to provide users with easy-to-understand actionable information in seven languages: English, Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, Filipino, Hindi and Nepali. It will also provide migrant community groups who speak these languages with access to training content and educational resources.
Although a digital resource will not provide physical sanctuary, an idea integral to the proposal for a migrant workers centre in Doha, the app is a rare sign of a constructive approach to dealing with the issue of legacy after the World Cup moves on from Qatar.
The creation of a legacy fund to remedy workers for injuries, or compensate the families of those who had died, was another key demand by the international community that has not been met. This week a group of agencies, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, attacked Fifa for rolling back on what had been perceived as a commitment to such an idea.
Fifa can still do the right thing by channelling the legacy fund towards workers and their families, supporting a genuinely independent workers centre and working with Qatar to ensure that every worker can access the compensation that they deserve, said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty Internationals head of economic and social justice."

Wahls wife, Dr Céline Gounder, said Wednesday that an autopsy was conducted by the New York City Medical Examiners Office.
Grant died from the rupture of a slowly growing, undetected ascending aortic aneurysm with hemopericardium, she wrote on her husbands website, referring to the wall that surrounds the heart. The chest pressure he experienced shortly before his death may have represented the initial symptoms. No amount of CPR or shocks would have saved him. His death was unrelated to Covid. His death was unrelated to vaccination status. There was nothing nefarious about his death.
Wahl, who was 49, was stricken in the media tribune of Lusail Iconic Stadium in Qatar early Saturday during extra time in Argentinas quarterfinal match against the Netherlands. Emergency workers immediately attended to him and treated him for 20 to 30 minutes before taking him away on a stretcher, reporters in his vicinity said.
His body was transported to New York.
This transition was handled with the utmost care and sensitivity, Gounder wrote. This was an international matter that required coordination from multiple agencies domestically and internationally, and there was full cooperation from everyone involved. Our sincere gratitude to everyone involved in repatriating Grant, in particular the White House, the US Department of State, Fifa, US Soccer and American Airlines.
Wahl had complained during the World Cup about feeling ill.
My body finally broke down on me. Three weeks of little sleep, high stress and lots of work can do that to you, Wahl wrote on 5 December. What had been a cold over the last 10 days turned into something more severe on the night of the USA-Netherlands game, and I could feel my upper chest take on a new level of pressure and discomfort.
Wahl wrote that he tested negative for Covid-19 and sought treatment for his symptoms.
I went into the medical clinic at the main media center today, and they said I probably have bronchitis. They gave me a course of antibiotics and some heavy-duty cough syrup, and Im already feeling a bit better just a few hours later. But still: No bueno, he wrote.
Wahl worked for Sports Illustrated from 1996 to 2021, known primarily for his coverage of soccer and college basketball. He then launched his own website, Fútbol with Grant Wahl, and a podcast with Meadowlark Media.
Wahl also worked for Fox Sports from 2012-19 and was hired by CBS Sports in 2021 as an analyst and editorial consultant. Wahl wrote the 2009 book The Beckham Experiment after English soccer star David Beckham joined Major League Soccers LA Galaxy and the 2018 book Masters of Modern Soccer.
Gounder said a memorial service is being planned."

Kibues family are requesting greater clarity on the circumstances surrounding the fall. We received news [on Tuesday] morning that he passed on, Anne Wanjiru, Kibues sister, told the Standard newspaper in Nairobi. We are very heartbroken.
Wanjiru called for help from the Kenyan government and Fifas president, Gianni Infantino. We want answers on the circumstances of his death, she said. They are claiming he was intoxicated. We hear he had worked for long hours. The clarity of how he fell is not coming out. We dont know where to start. It is very painful  they should help us.
Kibue is the second migrant worker confirmed as having died while working at the World Cup. Last week, a Filipino national died at the Sealine Resort, the training site for the Saudi Arabia national team. According to reports, he sustained head injuries after falling off a ramp in wet conditions.
The SC has confirmed an investigation into the death. The chief executive of the World Cup, Nasser al-Khater, appeared to dismiss concerns over the tragedy. Death is a natural part of life, whether its at work, whether its in your sleep, he said in response to questions about the death, first reported by the Athletic.

An umbrella group comprising, among others, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch has spoken out as the World Cup enters its final stages in Doha. It says plans announced by Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, to create a legacy fund that helps people most in need all across the world falls short of Fifas obligations, and undercuts assurances made before the tournament.
It has called on the games governing body to change direction and help victims by using some of the $7.5bn (£6.1bn) of revenue generated from taking the World Cup to Qatar to provide compensation.
Fifa can still do the right thing by channelling the legacy fund towards workers and their families, supporting a genuinely independent workers centre and working with Qatar to ensure that every worker can access the compensation that they deserve, said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty Internationals head of economic and social justice.
By changing course, Fifa could make a lasting difference to the lives of the true heroes behind this World Cup. Refusing to do so would be a terrible indictment on its commitment to workers rights.
In 2017 Fifa published its first human rights policy after criticism over the decision to award Qatar the World Cup. At its heart was a commitment to protecting human rights and remedying failures when they occurred, in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

To date, however, Fifa has made no express promise to remedy workers hurt or killed during the years of construction leading to the World Cup. A Workers Support and Insurance Fund run by the Qatari government claims to have paid out $350m to workers, but public evidence suggests it has so far been used to reimburse workers who have had wages stolen. Fifas obligations exist above and beyond any government action.
NGOs and charities, like European Football Associations who hoped to extract some form of legacy commitment, had extensive meetings with Fifa before the tournament and received encouragement only to be blindsided by a series of vague commitments in Infantinos bizarre speech that launched the tournament last month. Sources suggest there have been no further meetings since that date.

Nick McGeehan, the founding director of FairSquare, another member of the umbrella group, denounced Fifas actions. Instead of ensuring protection of migrant workers who built and delivered the World Cup infrastructure in Qatar, Fifa has benefited from their exploitation and parroted Qatari authorities talking points, showing their complicity to all the misleading claims and deflections on abuses of migrant workers, he said.
Fifa has tuned out genuine demands for remedy for migrant workers, including from the football industry, and ignored evidence of widespread uncompensated abuses and the inadequacies of the current compensation systems in Qatar.
Fifa has been approached for comment. It has previously said it would publish details of the finances of the legacy fund once the World Cup has finished in keeping with previous tournaments."

The incident occurred at about 2am on Saturday as the hospitality village was emptying out after the game, which Argentina won on penalties. It came shortly after the US journalist Grant Wahl died of an apparent heart attack while covering the match.
The precise circumstances surrounding the fall are unclear but one fan told the Guardian that the guard had dropped from the top outside concourse on to the ground below close to gate 30 of the stadium.
The person involved, who is believed to be a migrant worker, was rushed to Hamad hospital where he is said to be in a stable but critical condition.
In a statement Qatars supreme committee said: On Saturday 10 December a security guard at Lusail Stadium suffered a serious fall while on duty. Stadium medical teams immediately attended the scene and provided emergency treatment before he was transferred to Hamad Medical Hospital care unit via ambulance.
He remains in a stable but critical condition. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this time, and we wish him a speedy recovery. The host country is investigating the circumstances leading to the fall as a matter of urgency. He will continue to receive his salary in full while receiving medical care.
This latest incident comes days after it was reported that a Filipino national contracted to fix lights in a car park at the Sealine Resort, the training site for the Saudi Arabia national team, had died earlier in the tournament. According to reports the worker slipped off a ramp while walking alongside a vehicle and fell headfirst against concrete.
The chief executive of the Qatar World Cup, Nasser al-Khater, then sparked controversy by saying death is a natural part of life  whether its at work, whether its in your sleep, when asked about the death.

This was never more true than on Friday night, when messages of love, support, shock, and grief poured out across social media with the news of his sudden death while covering the World Cup in Qatar.
On Twitter, I remarked that for other journalists, he was a mentor and a cheerleader. And for readers, he was compelling, smart, and educational. Others echoed my sentiments: there are thousands of posts detailing how Grant helped others, the advice he gave them, what he was like as friend, and their favourite article of his (it should be noted, I have yet to see the same piece posted twice).
Even if Grant didnt know it, everyone has a Grant Wahl story.
Heres mine.
Like many other new media journalists, I first met Grant over Twitter. In 2011, I had it in my head that I was going to try to run for Fifa president. Someone suggested that I speak to Grant, who had made a similar attempt in protest at the presidency of Sepp Blatter. I tweeted him for advice, not expecting a response.
But Grant replied. And he replied with kindness, advice, and encouragement.
And thats how we first connected: over a mutual goal of challenging the institutionalized and systemic problems with Fifa. We both wanted to see a change, or, at the very least, we wanted to be a voice for change (granted, his voice was much more prominent than mine).
In 2011, I was a young journalist, just starting out. I was 25 years old and Toronto-based, trying to navigate my way through a male-dominated industry, on a continent that didnt really care about a sport I loved (for context, Toronto FC had only been in MLS for four years at that point).
For me, Grant was a rockstar, the type of person you aspired to be like. He was smart, passionate, and, above all else, a good writer. So when this man that I put on a pedestal reached a hand down to pull me up, I was astonished.
But I shouldnt have been. Because that was just Grants MO.
Grant did this for anyone who reached out: he pulled them up, treated them like an equal, and offered whatever he could to help. And thats why we all have Grant Wahl stories. He was a rarity in the field, not just because of his talent and passion, but because he wanted to bring out that talent and passion in others too. He selflessly worked to build a soccer community in North America.
Years later, when my writing partner Kirsten Schlewitz and I were launching Unusual Efforts  a football publication for unheard voices  Grant was a strong supporter. Not only did he champion our cause, but he also financially supported it, and were proud to have his name on our backers wall.
That was Grant: a champion and supporter of those in the industry.
Grant never backed away from a story or bringing it into the mainstream. I think thats why Unusual Efforts appealed to him: he too wrote about gender issues, was an ally for the LGBTQ2S+ community, and stood up for the voiceless long before  and long after  it was fashionable. He wanted to support writing he believed in; the type of stories published not for clicks, but for awareness. He used his privilege, power, and position for good, even when it was a detriment to himself.
Grants death has shocked journalists and readers alike because he was such an integral part of building soccer in North America. And as we grieve and mourn together, we can also honour Grants memory together. First, by continuing to tell our Grant Wahl stories and the impact that hes had. Second, by continuing his legacy to help others. Whether it be through mentorship, advice, or storytelling, we all must continue to be the voice that Grant was.
It both breaks my heart and makes me smile that his last public message to me was on 20 November, the first day of the World Cup. He was, once again, giving me advice on running for Fifa president.
Our last private conversation, a week before he died, was about one of his books. Despite how busy he was in Qatar, he still was happy to have a quick chat.
I just wish it had been longer.
To his family, I am sorry for your loss and I hope you find the love and peace that you need. To the sports community, I understand and share in your grief. And to Grant, thank you  and I hope we meet again."

Wahl, who was a correspondent for CBS Sports and wrote a popular Substack column, was 49 years old.
The entire US Soccer family is heartbroken to learn that we have lost Grant Wahl, the US Soccer Federation said in a statement. Here in the United States, Grants passion for soccer and commitment to elevating its profile across our sporting landscape played a major role in helping to drive interest in and respect for our beautiful game. As important, Grants belief in the power of the game to advance human rights was, and will remain, an inspiration to all.
Wahl was seated in the press box in the upper-most tier of the stadium when he collapsed in extra time, prompting the journalists around him to remove chairs and call for medical assistance.
A team of medics arrived and began administering CPR for the next 20 minutes. After the match concluded, Wahl was taken away from the scene.
Wahls wife, Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease epidemiologist who served on Joe Bidens coronavirus taskforce confirmed her husbands death in a statement on Twitter.
I am so thankful for the support of my husband @GrantWahls soccer family & of so many friends whove reached out tonight. Im in complete shock, she wrote.
US state department spokesperson Ned Price said in a tweet that the United States is engaged with senior Qatari officials to see to it that his familys wishes are fulfilled as expeditiously as possible.

Wahl made headlines earlier in the tournament when he was detained by security staff at Qatars Ahmad bin Ali Stadium for wearing a rainbow shirt to the United States World Cup opener against Wales. He said he wore the shirt as a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar.
Wahl wrote on Monday that he had visited a medical clinic in Qatar after feeling unwell.
My body finally broke down on me. Three weeks of little sleep, high stress and lots of work can do that to you, Wahl wrote. What had been a cold over the last 10 days turned into something more severe on the night of the USA-Netherlands game, and I could feel my upper chest take on a new level of pressure and discomfort. I didnt have Covid (I test regularly here), but I went into the medical clinic at the main media center today, and they said I probably have bronchitis. They gave me a course of antibiotics and some heavy-duty cough syrup, and Im already feeling a bit better just a few hours later. But still: No bueno.
Wahl was perhaps the best known soccer journalist in the United States. He covered his first World Cup in 1994 and joined Sports Illustrated in 1996. He stayed at the magazine for more than two decades, charting the rise of soccer in the US and wrote a well received book on David Beckhams arrival in MLS. He also wrote the magazines first cover story on LeBron James, while the basketball player was a rising star in high school. Qatar was Wahls eighth World Cup.
We were proud to call him a colleague and friend for two decades  no writer in the history of SI has been more passionate about the sport he loved and the stories he wanted to tell, Sports Illustrated said in a statement on Friday night. Our hearts go out to Celine and his family, as well as everyone who loved his work. He will always be part of the SI family.
Other writers and journalists paid tribute to Wahl as news of his death emerged.
Grant Wahl was my friend, one of the nicest, most truly decent people I have ever had the opportunity to work with. I am flattened, tweeted Will Leitch, the founding editor of Deadspin.
Brendan Hunt, the writer and co-star of Ted Lasso, also paid tribute to Wahl on Twitter.
Sitting here floored by the horrible news that Grant Wahl died today in Qatar, wrote Hunt. I have read his work for literally decades; just two months ago I had the pleasure of meeting him, and he was an absolute mensch. This is a tragic and devastating loss.
Wahl was well known as a champion of womens soccer. Former USWNT star Carli Lloyd described his death as truly heartbreaking on Twitter. She added: Completely shocked. My heart goes out to his wife, family, friends and the soccer community."

On Wednesday it was reported that a Filipino national contracted to fix lights in a car park at the Sealine Resort, the training site for the Saudi Arabia national team, had died after he slipped off a ramp while walking alongside a vehicle and fell headfirst against concrete.
It is the latest incident in a tournament where controversies over migrant workers, womens and LGBTQ+ rights have raged. However when asked about the subject, Nasser al-Khater questioned why journalists were bringing up the matter.
It was a World Cup like no other.

Were in the middle of a World Cup, he said. And we have a successful World Cup. And this is something you want to talk about right now? A worker died, our condolences to his family but it is strange that is something you want to focus on as your first question.
He added: Look, workers deaths have been a big subject during the World Cup. Everything that has been said and everything that has been reflected about workers deaths has been absolutely false.
Were a bit disappointed that the journalists have been exacerbating this false narrative. And honestly, I think a lot of the journalists have to ask themselves and reflect on why theyve been trying to bang on about the subject for so long.
Qatars World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, said in a statement that it was not involved in the Qatari investigation because the deceased [was] working as a contractor, not under the remit of the SC. The matter is being investigated by the Qatari authorities.
Nassers comments were immediately criticised by Human Rights Watch. The Qatari officials comment displays a callous disregard for the migrant worker who has died, its spokesperson Rothna Begum said. His statement that deaths happen and that its natural when it does, ignores the truth that many migrant worker deaths were preventable.
That message was echoed by Ella Knight, Amnesty Internationals migrants labour rights researcher, who said Khater was mistaken when he said every fatality was investigated. This is simply not true, she said. We and others have been calling on the Qatari authorities to conduct such investigations on workers deaths for years to no avail.
Instead, they continue to simply write off vast numbers of deaths as being due to natural causes despite the clear health risks associated with working in extreme temperatures.
The number of work-related deaths in Qatar is in dispute. Last year the Guardian reported that at least 6,500 migrant workers  many of them likely to have been working on World Cup preparations  had died in Qatar since it won the right to stage the event.
The Supreme Committee has said three work-related deaths and 37 non-work-related deaths have occurred on World Cup-related projects.
In a recent TV interview Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the SC, estimated that the number of migrant workers who had died on World Cup-related projects was between 400 and 500."

A huge surge in visitors at this stage is unlikely with only eight teams staying on in Doha, and eight games left out of the 64 in the tournament that began on 20 November.
Organisers had previously identified the peak period for international visitors to be 24-28 November during the busy group stage, when 32 teams were playing four matches every day.
The 7 December report was prepared by the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), which organises the tournament, and said that the first 17 days of the World Cup saw 765,859 international visitors, more than half of whom have now departed.
The report registered 1.33m match ticketholders and 3.09m tickets sold across the eight stadiums in Qatar for the tournament that ends on 18 December. A Qatari official, who did not wish to be named, confirmed the figures. The Supreme Committee did not respond to requests for comment.

The tournament in Qatar, the first to be held in the Middle East, is considered one of the most expensive in terms of tickets, hotels and alcohol, sales of which are restricted.
Fewer international visitors than originally forecast led to an unexpected glut of accommodation but has also averted major overcrowding or traffic headaches in Qatar, the smallest country by both population and area to host the World Cup.
The influx of visitors represents a 25% boost to the countrys resident population of three million, of which only about 10-12% are Qataris.
With over a week of competition still to go, a wave of new visitors has started arriving from the nations that made it to the quarter-finals, the Qatari official said.
More visitors are expected to flock to Qatar for popular matches after the country lifted entry restrictions for nationals and residents of fellow Gulf states. Cumulative stadium attendance at the first 52 matches was 2.65 million, the document said.
Previously, Fifa said that stadium attendance in Qatar had surpassed attendance at stadiums during a corresponding period at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
On Tuesday, hundreds of Moroccan fans flew into Qatar on special flights arranged before their teams victory over Spain. It is expected that similar fights will be laid on to allow last-minute fans to fly in from overseas to watch their teams attempt to advance.
Visitors to Qatar must obtain a Hayya identification card prior to travel as it doubles as a mandatory entry visa during the tournament period. On Tuesday, Qatar dropped this requirement for Gulf Cooperation Council countries."

In the letter Ibhaiss family claims he spent four days in complete darkness in solitary confinement after being physically assaulted as punishment for contributing to last months ITV documentary Qatar: State of Fear?  with the air conditioning at full blast and used as a torture device. He was in a cell of two by one metres with a hole in the ground as a bathroom and with temperatures near freezing, the letter adds. I was already suffering from several bruises after the prison guards assault and I was shivering all the time, as the cold air directed to me never stopped. I hardly slept during those four days, he told us.
Ibhais says he was jailed after raising concerns that the Supreme Committee planned to deny that World Cup workers were involved in a strike of between 4,000 and 6,000 people in Doha. He says he found 200 workers in Education City Stadium and Al Bayt Stadium that had no drinking water and had not been paid for four months. However, Qatars authorities insist that Ibhais, who was removed from his role in 2019, was sentenced on fraud charges relating to a contract to produce social media content for the World Cup. But that is disputed by Fair Square, which says he was coerced into a confession and denied a fair trial.
Nicholas McGeehan of FairSquare said Ibhais had gone to Fifa before his arrest. He was messaging directly members of Fifas human rights team, said McGeehan. At some point, however, they just disappeared. They essentially ghosted him  for want of a better word  and he had no further communication from them after that.

Ibhaiss family also directly criticises Fifa in its letter. We the family of Abdullah Ibhais are calling out Fifa and its president Gianni Infantino, who once said the World Cup is the voice of the marginalised, it states. Your deeds havent lived up to your words, Fifa is complicit in Abdullahs imprisonment and Fifas silence is tearing apart our family. We refuse Fifas callous indifference, we refuse to back down.
Fifa and the Supreme Committee were approached for comment. Both confirmed they were aware of the letter and its contents."

Thursday night in Doha. A crowded metro train is heading west towards the Khalifa International Stadium for Japan v Spain. A quick stock take of the carriage reveals the following: one Filipino woman from Hong Kong in a Spain shirt and baseball cap; two Japanese women in face masks talking to two Nepalese friends (one of whom flew to Qatar just for the game), both wearing Japan kits; three Korean-Americans searching for tickets; a family of Mexicans (a sombrero gives it away) rooting for Spain; three rowdy Saudi Arabia supporters; and above the door a calling card from the Argentinians who are never far away  a Panini sticker of Diego Maradona from USA 94.
It was an unlikely combination, but not an unusual one in the city these past few weeks and heres the argument: the Doha Metro is the place to be at this World Cup. If you want to spend time talking to people from across the world, if you want to learn about their hopes and fears (mainly football-related), if you want to laugh, to sing and be reminded how much human beings have in common, then take the train. Or march up and down the escalators, or congregate in the concourses. Really, honestly, its where its at.
There are a number of reasons why, starting with a substantial feat of engineering. The Doha Metro has three lines: the Gold or Historic line, which runs east to west through the older parts of the city; the Red or Coast line, which heads north to south linking the heart of Doha with the new development of Lusail, about 40km away; and finally, the Green or Education line, which takes in Qatar University, the National Library and, well, the Mall of Qatar.
It serves 37 stations along 75km of track and, 12 years ago, not a single bit of it existed. A venture involving Qatari planners, German rail operators, Japanese train manufacturers, American engineering and construction, French IT systems and British insurers, the project cost about $36bn and was delivered in nine years from the time the first tunnel boring machine activated its thrust system. It opened in 2019, in time for the Club World Cup, and around 60 more stations are planned to be added by 2026.
The experience of riding the trains is just as impressive. As an experience it is unfailingly pleasant. Driverless trains glide between stations with nary a bump. They arrive every three minutes (maybe five at 2am) and give you enough time to get on without rushing. Event team members on the platforms prevent overcrowding.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
For the duration of the tournament, travel on the metro has been free to anyone with a Hayya card, the visa-turned-ID card obligatory for visitors. The gold-class carriage, a pretty pointless first-class section (youre rarely on the train for more than 20 minutes), has also been democratised for the month. The gold-class lounges, however  tiny waiting rooms at the station where rich customers can sit in a stiff-backed chair  remain subscriber-only.
If all this sounds a bit train-spottery, it was certainly of interest to Hassan, a man in charge of a group of Morocco fans heading to the Canada game on Thursday. He, like anybody else who would talk on the subject, was a big fan of the metro but he had his complaints.
The carriages are too small, you have to break the group in two, he said.
And the signage is confusing  you dont know which direction youre going in sometimes or which side the door is going to open. It is important that you agree a place to meet before you travel, otherwise you might get lost.
All relevant information, but Hassan, who travelled with a 40-strong gang from Casablanca, was also indulging in the more important activity of in-train banter. His Moroccans had been joined in the carriage by two Canada fans, one wearing the desirable (and sold-out) furry headdress that mixes Arab tradition with the smiling features of the World Cup mascot Laeeb. The other wore a Canada baseball cap with a Ghana paper party hat on top.
Hassan was straight into them: Canada? Go home! he said. Dont you know its Christmas time? Its time you went back for your presents!
When the Red line train arrived at Oqba Ibn Nafie station, the Canada fans got their own back, (below) waving an enormous maple leaf flag in the faces of the Moroccans as they passed down the escalator, singing a chorus of Olé Olé Olé.

One Moroccan fan, Osama, also from Casablanca, insisted on giving an interview. He did not have much to say, describing the metro as very well organised, but he was certainly memorable. Skinny as a rake and wearing rose-tinted John Lennon spectacles, he also had a pair of inflatable moose antlers on his head, given to him by a Canadian.
At this point it is perhaps important to pause. On 28 February 2016, a construction worker from the Philippines, Juanito B Pardillo, died while working on the metro project. In April of that year the Building and Wood Workers International union said that his family were still waiting for an official explanation of what happened, though media reports suggested Pardillo had been helping to excavate a tunnel while it was raining when it collapsed, something that went against safety rules. Four other workers were injured. They were part of an estimated 18,000 workers working for a construction contractor on the project at the time.
For most users of the metro, however, any contact with migrant workers is likely to be with a Kenyan. They are the men who, exclusively it seems according to the foibles of the subcontracting process, fulfil the role of directing tourists in and out of the stations. Working long days, monitoring crowds that manifest only at certain times, its a tough gig, but these customer service executives have taken a mundane job and made it into something more.
It started with Abubakr Abbass, the 23-year-old whose job it was to direct crowds at the busy Souq Waqif station. Instead of issuing instructions in the time-honoured officious manner, he turned his directions into a chant: Metro? This way! Metro? This way! In a city full of people looking for a communal experience, it caught on.
Crowds would start the chant as they arrived at stations or stepped off trains. Abbass became a hit on TikTok and was a guest on the pitch during the England v USA group-stage match. Other young Kenyans then took the idea on, creating dance routines (complete with pointy finger foam hands) and writing longer songs. Dear customer. Where are you going? went one example. You can go for the metro, or the tram, you can go this way, this way, this way. Some who heard that version reported it being still stuck in their heads days later.
What the Kenyans tapped into was something that can be lacking in the official spaces of the Fifa World Cup in Qatar 2022: a sense of humour. And that they were able to practise it in and around the metro was perhaps not a coincidence.
Not only is the train network one of the few places free to use in Doha, its also a space where you can stand still and just be. Even better, you might be able to sit down on a comfortable chair (rather than, say, the tarmac of the official Fifa fan park). Its a space that is occupied by the public, where people all over the world gather in unexpected combinations.
I have watched matches there, discussed politics, compared prices and sought tips. I have sung and I have danced and most of all I have laughed. The metro has been an actual pleasure."

The comedian Jarl Friis-Mikkelsen, who wrote the lyrics, suggested a B-side to be played in the event of, say, a shocking 5-1 defeat against an inferior Spain team. The chorus was subtly different: We are red, we are white, we are really deep in sh!te. The DBU politely declined, but Mikkelsens alternative chorus has been in the Fiv  bear with us, this is going to take some time  Football Dailys mind in the past 24 hours. Denmark, who were some folks dark horses to win the Human Rights World Cup, are instead on flight DO1 to Copenhagen after a miserable performance: three games, one point, one goal.
They arrived at the HR World Cup wearing a toned-down kit as a statement about Qatars human-rights record, but nobody expected them to produce three toned-down performances as well. Maybe it was an exceptionally subtle form of protest, eventually to be revealed in a Palme dOr-winning mockumentary. We dont want to be visible during a tournament that has cost the lives of thousands of people, said the kit manufacturer Hummel, and sadly the team took that idea and ran with it. After the Danish Dynamite glory of Euro 2020, this was the Danish Damp Squib. We havent played with the right tempo and rhythm, said coach Kasper Hjulmand after the 1-0 defeat to Australia. The structure just went  The thing we shouldnt do is play with emotion in a match like this, we should play with quality. But the football sucked.
So far Denmark have been the biggest disappointment of the tournament, though that may soon change. Belgiums angsty, ageing team meet Croatia on Thursday afternoon, knowing they will almost certainly go out unless they win, and then Germany play Costa Rica afterwards knowing that even a win might not be enough. They are likely to give a start to Niclas Füllkrug, the beefy, gap-toothed bulldozer who looks like a Hollyoaks wrongun but is fast becoming Football Dailys favourite player. Not bad for someone we hadnt heard of two weeks ago.

While Füllkrugs time is now, Belgiums players have been arguing over which of them is the biggest has-been. LEquipe reported that Kevin De Bruynes comment about Belgium being too old to win the HRWC led to a row in the dressing-room after their defeat to Morocco. We have some outlets in Belgium that are quite happy to jump on fake news, sighed their coach, snake-oil entrepreneur Roberto Martínez. Thats quite astonishing  [It is] probably a lesson for all of us  that we are here on our own and we are here to fight for what we believe is the way we want to play and hopefully the fans  the real fans  of the Red Devils can enjoy the process. Belgium are red, Germany are white, and by Friday at least one of them could be really deep in sh!te.

We were convinced that it was over, everyone was going back to the locker room. It took a long, long time and Mr Conger, the New Zealand referee, went to consult the VAR. He was told after a very long time that there was an offside by Antoine Griezmann and that goal was therefore disallowed  TF1 hack Grégoire Margotton explains the channels error after it cut away from Les Bleus game with Tunisia, thinking it had finished 1-1, only for the apparent last-gasp equaliser to be disallowed while they were on an ad break and with millions of viewers having switched off.
I see those arrogant Australians also found out what happens when you flamin dont focus on football. Oh, wait   Patrick OBrien.
How quaint of the crowd to boo Gianni Infantino when he appeared on the stadium big screen the other night. I suspect, like heel wrestlers and pantomime villains, Fifa executives accept these brickbats as a sign they are doing a good job  John Lawton.
Reading multiple reports from the HRWC about England/Wales/insert team and the need to take the handbrake off, it has me wondering: do a lot of football writers drive around with the handbrake on? Perhaps that burning smell isnt the result of furious creativity while covering a 0-0 draw, after all  Alex Frew McMillan.
I bought a big telly so I could suffer Englands latest tease in style. But its also brought into sharp focus how badly the pitches are cutting up in the desert. Some of the £200bn spent on this folly of a football fest mightve been better spent on the grass rather than hat-confiscating security guards  Lindsay Williams.

Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the Supreme Committee for delivery and legacy, made the admission in an interview but said a precise figure for the number of fatalities was still being discussed.
The estimate is around 400, Thawadi told the TV show Piers Morgan Uncensored. Between 400 and 500. I dont have the precise number, that is something that is being discussed.

One death is too many, its as simple as that. [But] every year the health and safety standards on the sites are improving, at least on our sites, the World Cup sites, the ones we are responsible for. Most definitely to the extent that you have trade unions [commending] the work that has been done on World Cup sites and the improvement.
After the interview there was anger at Thawadis comments with Nicholas McGeehan of the advocacy group Fair Square saying: This is just the latest example of Qatars inexcusable lack of transparency on the issues of workers deaths. We need proper data and thorough investigations, not vague figures announced through media interviews. Fifa and Qatar still have a lot of questions to answer, not least where, when, and how did these men die and did their families receive compensation.
The Supreme Committee has always maintained there have been only three work-related fatalities and 37 non-work-related deaths among migrant workers at World Cup stadiums since construction for the tournament began in 2014.
On Tuesday an SC spokesperson said: This is documented on an annual basis in the SCs public reporting and covers the eight stadiums, 17 non-competition venues and other related sites under the SCs scope. Separate quotes regarding figures refer to national statistics covering the period of 2014-2020 for all work-related fatalities (414) nationwide in Qatar, covering all sectors and nationalities.
In 2021 the Guardian published research that showed that more than 6,500 migrant workers from five countries  India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka  had died in Qatar between the start of 2011, the year after country won the right to host the World Cup, and 2020.
While the Guardians figures showed the total number of deaths from all causes and in all locations, activists have always argued that the World Cup caused an increase in the number of migrant workers travelling to the country. At the time McGeehan said: A very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup.
The Qatari government did not dispute the Guardians figures, but said that the mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population. The official figure of three stadium work-related World Cup deaths was repeated by Fifa and used in a speech by its president, Gianni Infantino, in an address to the European Council this year.
Steve Cockburn, Amnesty Internationals head of economic and social justice, said: The continued debate around the number of workers who have died in the preparation of the World Cup exposes the stark reality that so many bereaved families are still waiting for truth and justice. Over the last decade, thousands of workers have returned home in coffins, with no explanation given to their loved ones."

While Fifa has not specified how many tickets it sold directly to US supporters, it has confirmed the United States ranked third in tickets sold by country of residence behind Qatar and Saudi Arabia and ahead of Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.
Even as a number of American fans on the ground have expressed concern over the host countrys human rights abuses with respect to migrant laborers, women and the LGBTQ community, the environmental costs of hosting the tournament in the region as well as the persistent allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and Fifa executives, the allure of the World Cup remains as strong as ever with a robust US travelling contingent that belies the sports modest popularity back home.
Denise Kiernan, an author from Asheville, North Carolina, said that she was grateful for the World Cups ability to call attention to Qatars dismal human rights record, but hopes the global media will keep its focus on the issues here once the tournament is over.
I am always bothered by human rights violations wherever they occur, Kiernan said. It did not prevent me from coming to this tournament. I am glad a light is being shone on them. What I am very curious to see is whether or not people who have been following the stories of the treatment of migrant workers, for example  whether or not their families were properly reimbursed for deaths and injuries, whether or not people are paid  I want to see whether or not those stories are followed three months, six months, nine months, a year out, to make sure that those issues are resolved. What would bother me is if they were not.
Erin Blankenship, the co-founder of Equal Playing Field, a non-profit initiative dedicated to challenge gender inequality in sport, grew up in California but lives in Cairo. She was bothered by the off-field issues but didnt hesitate to travel to Qatar for her sixth World Cup, which she gives a mixed review compared to previous editions.
The Qataris did what the Qatari do very well, right? Blankenship said. They invest in infrastructure and thats what theyve really focused on as part of their legacy components. I think the prices are pretty outrageous, but it was all part of what I expected.
Theres a lot of really irrational components, even the basic security protocols that are very annoying. The fact that they draw you out in these long snakey lines with single points of entry and exit to a stadium for 50,000 people. Its a control thing. I get that, but it doesnt make sense for the fan experience. Thats a bit frustrating, but otherwise I think its been pretty enjoyable.
An almost universal gripe among US fans has been the last-minute ban of beer sales in match areas and in fan zones only two days before the tournament in a stunning reversal.
Marcus Brown, a Brooklyn native attending his first World Cup and wearing a Clint Dempsey shirt at Sunday nights match between Croatia and Canada, was not happy when he learned that beer would be outlawed from inside and around the perimeter of the stadiums. But he said that coming across alcohol has been surprisingly easy thanks to the efforts of a US fan known as Map Man, whose meticulously sourced catalog of the various hotels and restaurants where beer and liquor are sold has been viewed more than 700,000 times, making him a minor cult hero at the tournament.
To make the decision to cut off beer two days before the tournament makes it feel like a bait-and-switch from the Qatari government, Brown said. They waited till everybody was here before they announced a decision they probably made up their mind about months or years ago. Its been easy enough to find a drink as long as youre willing to pay $20 for a beer, but it would have been nice to have one or two at the stadiums before the game.
For Kiernan, other concerns around the first World Cup to be staged in a conservative Muslim nation, including the criminalization of homosexuality in Qatar, have not been a problem as shes made her way around the city and surrounding stadiums.
Everyone has been incredibly nice and helpful, she said. I have had zero problems. I have spent time with various cultures. I have spent time out and about in the city and in the stadiums with gay men. Nothing has been raised or been an issue. I am not saying that doesnt mean things havent happened, but as far as my experiences, its been very easy.
But for now, the attention has turned to Tuesdays match against Iran at the Al Thumama Stadium, where the United States must win to keep their tournament alive and progress to the knockout stage.
I think we were the better team on the pitch [against England], but we didnt finish, Kiernan said. Its a young team that plays off each other in interesting ways. I put our fitness, our physicality and our focus up against anyones. I want to see them go all the way.

What we know about the human cost of the 2022 World Cup,"The deaths of migrant workers in Qatar in the build-up to this years World Cup have drawn criticism across the world. While the tournaments organizers put the official count at 40, estimates by the Guardian put the figure in the thousands. Here we explore the key questions around an issue that has tarnished the World Cup for many fans.
World soccers governing body, Fifa, awarded Qatar  a country slightly smaller than Connecticut with scant soccer pedigree  the tournament in December 2010 in a bidding process that, according to American authorities, was riddled with corruption. The shock decision sparked a frenzy of construction in the wealthy nation, which this year became the planets biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas.
The high profile of the tournament has drawn attention to Qatars dubious human rights record, including its hostility towards LGBT people, and the dangerous and exploitative conditions faced by the vast numbers of migrant workers who have built the infrastructure.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Migrant workers were indispensable to making the World Cup 2022 possible, but it has come at great cost for many migrant workers and their families who not only made personal sacrifices, but also faced widespread wage theft, injuries, and thousands of unexplained deaths, said Rothna Begum, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The population of Qatar is about three million, roughly 88% of whom are foreign citizens. The migrant workforce is estimated at two million, comprising 95% of the labor force. About a million people are employed in construction and another 100,000 are domestic workers. Mostly men, a large percentage come from the Philippines and south Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.
The first Middle Eastern country to host the World Cup finals, Qatar has spent anywhere from $220bn-$300bn on infrastructure projects as it uses the globes biggest sporting event as a catalyst for nation-building.
At a cost of $6.5bn, Qatar has built seven new stadiums for the tournament and renovated an eighth. Other construction projects have included major upgrades to public transport and roads, and new skyscrapers, hotels and housing, as well as Lusail, a new city that will host the final.
The official count among workers on World Cup sites is 37 non-work related deaths and only three from work-related accidents but many believe that is a vast undercount.
The problem is that it is hard to associate a firm figure with the tournament and to assess how many deaths were preventable given the lack of available information. Fifa and the Qatari organizers have sought to distance World Cup-related construction from more general projects, though it is likely that many of these would not have been commissioned without the tournament-inspired boom. And they have been on tight deadlines to be ready for the influx of an estimated 1.2 million soccer fans.
Overall, 15,021 non-Qataris died in the country between 2010 and 2019, according to the government. A Guardian analysis in February 2021 found that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since the award of the tournament. The death records were not categorised by occupation or place of work. The government has said that 30,000 foreign laborers were employed to build World Cup stadiums.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) found that in 2020, 50 people suffered work-related deaths, 500 were seriously injured, and 37,600 sustained mild to moderate injuries.
Average high temperatures in Qatar exceed 100F (37.7C) for five months of the year. Though the tournament was moved from summer to winter for the safety and comfort of players, officials and fans, workers are at risk of accidents, heat-related illnesses and other ailments related to the physical and mental strains of working long hours in extreme heat. Suicide is also a concern. Construction workers frequently live in squalid conditions that stand in stark contrast with the opulence of many of the facilities they build.
The Qatari government has argued that the mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population. But statistics show that a large number of young or middle-aged men from Nepal, who would have undergone health checks before being allowed to enter Qatar, have died from heart problems.
Following on from reporting by the Guardians Pete Pattisson, an Amnesty International report from 2021 accused Qatar of routinely [issuing] death certificates for migrant workers without conducting adequate investigations, instead attributing deaths to natural causes or vaguely defined cardiac failures  making it impossible for bereaved families to claim compensation.
The organization found that as many of 70% of migrant deaths are classified imprecisely, with Guardian data suggesting that 69% of deaths among Indian, Nepali and Bangladeshi workers have been categorised as natural. The ILO report states that falls from height and road traffic accidents were the leading causes of severe injuries.
In 2021 the Guardian highlighted the deaths of workers such as Gangaram Mandal, a laborer from Nepal who came to Qatar in 2018 in order to support his wife and seven daughters. He borrowed money to pay a recruitment fee then earned the equivalent of a dollar a day. After two years he fell ill at the end of a shift during the summer. His death was classed as heart failure, natural causes.
The country has introduced labor law reforms in the past five years, though critics charge that these do not go far enough to protect workers and that enforcement is patchy. Thousands of workers across all projects are still facing issues such as delayed or unpaid wages, denial of rest days, unsafe working conditions, barriers to changing jobs, and limited access to justice, while the deaths of thousands of workers remain uninvestigated, according to Amnesty. A minimum wage for all workers equivalent to about $275 a month came into force in 2021.
Teams such as Denmark and the Netherlands have been far more vocal in their criticism of working conditions and human rights than Fifa, which has banned players from wearing OneLove rainbow armbands. Shortly before the tournament the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, urged teams to focus on the football.
Infantino later claimed Fifa deserved credit for influencing Qatar to improve standards, including abolishing its abusive kafala worker sponsorship system, and said that criticism of the country reeked of Western hypocrisy.
Concerns about LGBT rights, forced labor and unsafe conditions also marred the previous World Cup, in Russia in 2018. A report by the Building and Wood Workers International union group found that 21 construction workers died building stadiums in Russia, mostly as a result of falls from heights or being struck by falling equipment."

And not an overwhelming sense of a country waking up with World Cup fever. The assignment is to reflect what it is like in Doha as Qatar opens the first World Cup to be staged in the Middle East with a game against Ecuador. On a two-hour walk around the city before ending up at Souq Waqif, a traditional magnet for locals and tourists, the only signs of World Cup life are an organised gathering for Qataris (100 maximum) outside Millennium Plaza, a few cars driving past waving both Qatar and Palestine flags, and two men sat outside a refrigerator repair shop with a TV propped up on a chair. Souq Waqif is livelier, although more people are gathered around a Korean technology stand than looking for the game. There is dangerous overcrowding at the Fan Festival, however, where too many people descend on the 40,000-capacity venue and are kept in a holding area for almost an hour before being herded away. An inevitable consequence, you might say, of hosting a World Cup in and around one city that offers few options for football fans.

A day at the main media centre, the football journalists equivalent of The Terminal starring Tom Hanks. You might never leave. And that might be the point. It has a hair and beauty salon, a gym, a dry cleaners, a bar, restaurants, a vast working area, two virtual stadium experiences (watching matches at the cinema, basically), two press conference rooms and a bus terminus from where you can travel to all the games. The France head coach, Didier Deschamps, is besieged with requests for selfies from local journalists after previewing the world champions opener against Australia. There is standing room only for Argentinas press conference due to the appearance of Lionel Messi and there is a rush for the exits when he finishes, leaving Saudi Arabia head coach, Hervé Renard, to address an almost deserted auditorium. The worlds media will be hanging on his every word inside 24 hours.
Jackpot. Covering Messi at his last World Cup was already special but Argentina v Saudi Arabia exceeds all expectations. On the metro up to Lusail Stadium it feels like a World Cup is finally under way with carriages crammed with Argentina and Saudi supporters in full voice. The atmosphere inside the World Cup final venue is exceptional and builds as Saudi Arabia produce one of the biggest shocks in the competitions history. An unforgettable moment. Then its off to the Fan Festival to watch France v Australia. A 500ml can of Budweiser  the only alcohol available  costs 50 Qatari riyal, roughly £11.50.
Apartment  metro  media centre  bus  stadium  metro  apartment. This, more or less, is the daily work routine. Monotonous, yes, but youre not missing out on much in Qatar. Its the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium tonight for Canadas first World Cup appearance in 36 years. They should beat Belgium; they lose, on account of never scoring at a World Cup. It is now four World Cup games without a goal for Canada. A record. The 10pm kick-off means getting back to the apartment at 3.15am, once everything is filed and the last metro is caught. It could be worse: the journalist next to me in the stadium opened a bottle of Coca-Cola before kick-off that exploded everywhere but mainly down into his laptop. It died.
While taking in the sights on a walk along the Corniche, Dohas seven-kilometre promenade, word comes through of a late ticket for Brazil v Serbia at Lusail Stadium. We were given a Qatar-controlled look at the safe and happy migrant labourers tour of the World Cup final venue under construction three years ago while here with Liverpool for the Club World Cup. It was a stadium in a desert. Now it is a stadium next to a growing city of glittering towers, architecturally stunning hotels, apartment blocks, boulevards and Place Vendo?me mall, a French-Vegas style construction covering 1,150,000 square metres. Its taken longer for Liverpool city council to reconfigure Lime Street, as Richarlison can testify. Now hes flinging himself into World Cup superstardom.

The power of the World Cup strikes like a bolt. The sound of the Iran national anthem being booed and whistled by Iranians before kick-off against Wales and the sight of Iranian women and men left distraught afterwards is incredibly moving. It serves as another rebuke to the pathetic appeal by Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, for everyone to stick to the football. Security guards following orders confiscate an Iran fans football shirt that has Mahsa Amini 22 printed on the back, the name and age of the woman whose death in police custody sparked the ongoing protests in the country. Shame on Fifa. There are reports of fans being arrested for carrying flags opposed to the Islamic republic and for banners with the protest slogan Women, life, freedom. Shame on Qatar. Iran players somehow block out the powerful distractions to produce an emotion-charged victory.
Apartment  metro  media centre  bus  stadium  metro  apartment."

His family are being offered UK consular assistance and support by the Football Supporters Association Cymru.
The group tweeted: Unfortunately we have lost one of the Red wall yesterday in Qatar, our sincere condolences go out to his son here in Doha and his family back in Wales. May he rest in peace.
Noel Mooney, the chief executive of the Football Association of Wales said: So sorry to hear that one of our supporters has passed away here.
Our condolences go to the family and of course we are here to support however we can.

Most supporters are here for a short while and perhaps on a tour. Two England fans, father and son, had taken in the Formula One in Abu Dhabi on the way over. One American family, browsing the rails at a knock-off sports shop, were taking in 10 games in Thanksgiving week then heading home. What were they doing in between matches? Its quite nocturnal, so you sleep. And then you go to the mall. I mean, its the Gulf  what else is there to do?
There have been some miserable exceptions to this rule with reports of sewage flooding shipping container apartments in fan villages, or brown water coming from taps. Some fans have been offered a refund on accommodation that had not been finished in time. Meanwhile Wales fans have had to engage their Football Association to complain to Fifa after their hats were confiscated by security because they displayed the rainbow symbol.

Still, it is difficult to find discord on the streets of Qatar  that may be because those who are disgruntled have stayed at home. A lot of people have looked at the price, looked at the restrictions  with all accommodation and transportation funnelled through the organisers and entry to the country dependent on possession of a match ticket  and decided to give this World Cup a miss. Official estimations of 1.2 million foreign visitors this month seem way off.
Thats not to say you cant tell a tournament is on. Doha has been done up to the nines, plastered in bunting, slogans and endless advertising, some of it stripped hundreds of metres along the height of skyscrapers in the gleaming West Bay district. At night and weekends the locals  largely but not exclusively the South Asian community  take to the streets in replica shirts (Argentina, then Brazil, then Qatar in that order) and bang drums on the Corniche and the boulevard of the new neighbourhood-cum-city of Lusail.
There are, also, decent contingents from regional neighbours  Saudi Arabia most obviously, but also Morocco and Tunisia. Argentinians and Mexicans have travelled too, the Latin American presence at a tournament thousands of miles and dollars away perhaps boosted by expat communities from the USA. In terms of substantial followings, that may be about the full extent, with other countries maxing out at the 2,000 to 3,000 ultras visible in the stadiums.
The matches are the best place to see people. There hasnt been a fixture without empty seats, with Qatars match against Senegal on Friday the most egregious example yet. But most games have had an atmosphere worthy of a World Cup, largely thanks to the ultras and their resident drummers, but perhaps also down to the acoustics of stadiums built at such great cost.
To be in the ground is to feel part of something, but that sensation quickly dissipates on departure and to recapture it is a challenge almost impossible to master. The organisers have their answer: the Fifa fan festival, a 40,000-capacity space in full view of the West Bay skyscrapers. It has free entry for those with appropriate ID (the Hayya card, a digital application so insecure that German authorities have advised wiping your phone after using it). It stays open till 2am and by 10pm the crowd can be substantial, but they remain quiet. That is perhaps a reflection of the atomised groups of supporters in attendance, padded out by locals who  not infrequently  are taking advantage of the opportunity to drink alcohol legally and in public.

The fan festival has no seating and no shade (if fans do complain about one thing its that awnings and umbrellas or even trees to cut out the glare from the still fiery winter sun are in short supply). The attractions on offer within are largely showcases for the products of sponsors. The fan festival is as much trade fair as fun park and beyond it there are not many places to go.
To come to Doha is to experience a city without a sense of the public realm. Its the absence not only of bars to gather in but of parks and squares too. The best limbs videos of exuberant support have come from small, dark bars in international hotels. The American family are not wrong when they say that the mall  of which there are many  is the best place to congregate. But traipsing around the shops does not facilitate the sort of spontaneous meeting and exchange with people from different cultures that usually characterises an international sporting event.
The opening week of this tournament has been characterised by tension over who controls the World Cup. Changing rules over the sale of beer suggested Qatari organisers had the whip hand over Fifa. Threats of sporting sanctions over OneLove armbands showed Fifa flexing its muscles over European associations. Where the fans and the countries they represent sit among all this is a moot point. The strange thing, and this is a strange World Cup no doubt, is that very few people here seem to be bothered."

Its the hypocritical west, too, 21 November). Saudi Arabia does so too, for example Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Yet Saudi Arabia still gets to host a Formula One grand prix, so-called Clash on the Dunes boxing matches, and international golfing. The 2012 Bahrain grand prix went ahead amid torture and the shooting dead of unarmed protesters. Malik is also right to stress that our governments arm the Gulf states, provide them with surveillance technology, PR, political and diplomatic cover, and  in a situation where sovereign wealth is often hard to distinguish from private hyper-wealth  safe havens for blood money.
In return for turning a blind eye to grotesque human rights abuses and institutional homophobia and misogyny, we get cheap hydrocarbons, inward investment that melds our economy with those of the Gulf states, a regional security stance and, in the case of Bahrain, a Royal Navy base. Gulf sportswashing has a wider context, and it is a sad reflection on us that human rights abuses only occasionally come to the fore during sporting events, and media debate is so often mired in anti-Arab racism.
We are sordidly complicit in these abuses. If the UKs commitment to human rights is to be meaningful, this has to stop. I speak from experience, having worked on one of Bahrains reform projects, only to have to flee the country because of my advocacy for students academic freedoms and human rights.Dr Mike DibollFormer academic head of professional development at Bahrain Teachers
As a South African born in the 1970s, I can well remember the way that country was rightly shunned by the rest of the world for its racist policies and its brutality in carrying them out. Starting with the Olympics in the 1960s, we were steadily frozen out of international competition. There were, of course, occasions when white South African money talked  the annual Sun City $1m golf challenge being the most obvious. By and large, however, in the mid-1980s South Africa was a pariah, where only rebel teams visited, often facing protests on tour and disciplinary action on their return home.
For us, politics and sport were inextricably linked, but it was a matter beyond politics: it was a matter of ethics. In western countries, much of the opposition to South African participation was led by the general public, who were often ahead of their governments in condemning the apartheid regime.
Thus, in recent decades, I have gone from disappointment to bitter resignation as I repeatedly saw the biggest international sporting events landing in countries run by some of the worlds most brutal regimes. In that context, the backlash about the current Fifa World Cup being held in Qatar gives me some hope that maybe politics  or, more importantly, ethics  is coming back into sport. Maybe Fifa has finally bitten off more than the public will swallow. If so, at least something good will come out of this otherwise repugnant spectacle.Karl EklundEdinburgh
Concerning demonstrations in Qatar, while we would all wish for a greater acceptance of the LGBQT+ community, observance of migrant rights and greater freedoms for women, it ill behoves us to be holier than thou about these difficult matters. As a gay man, it was illegal for me to take part in sexual activity with another man when I was at university, and this only changed within living memory. Indeed, still today many people are scared to come out and homophobia exists in many areas of our daily life.
Nor can we be proud if we look at the treatment of the Windrush generation and the discrimination they received on arrival in this country, many of whom have still not received compensation from the Home Office for wrongful attempts to deport them in recent years. And again, we all know of instances of racial discrimination in sport, and the terrible way in which immigrants are still dealt with.
As for the way we treat women, once more we have no cause for smugness, with almost daily accounts of appalling behaviour from the police; and though there are many women in high positions in this country, there exist many areas of life where it is still a mans world such as the legal profession and the entertainment industry.
The suffragettes campaign for female emancipation is only just beyond present memory and my mothers generation was largely expected to stay at home to look after the children. So, lets by all means protest and seek to change others views, but we are far from perfect too.Antony BarlowWallington, Surrey
Mihir Bose expresses exactly my view on the moral dilemma facing those wishing to watch the Qatar World Cup (I hate the very idea of this World Cup in Qatar, but Ill have to watch: its the beautiful game, 19 November). After my first visit to see a Leeds game, I too realised that the game resonated far beyond the field of play. It was like an out-of-body experience.
In spite of the corrupt nature of Fifa and its attitude towards human rights  which must be tackled at source, not during a tournament when its too late  football remains a potent source of hope and belief for millions, much as religion used to be. Bose is right: we will watch the World Cup in the hope that the humanity in the beautiful game outweighs the uglinesses of the path it has taken. We love this game because it is much bigger than cynicism and power politics. We cannot do otherwise.Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire

Then he leans into the microphone with a message: Viva Palestine.
Another clip from the streets of Doha this week shows a group of Lebanese men walking away from a live interview with a reporter they have just learned is Israeli. One shouts over his shoulder: There is no Israel. Its Palestine.
As hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have poured into Qatar this week for the World Cup, these are among the awkward encounters between Arab football fans and Israeli journalists that have gone viral on Middle Eastern social media, one of many sources of political friction at a tournament that has not yet shaken off its myriad controversies.
For the host country, staging the World Cup has involved delicate negotiations over the presence of LGBTQ+ fans, public displays of affection and the availability of beer and wine. Less prominent in the west, but no less fraught, has been the emirates accommodation of Israeli football fans and media, a concession to Fifas rules for hosting the multibillion-dollar tournament.
Qatar does not have official ties with Israel but has given special permission for direct flights from Tel Aviv and allowed Israeli diplomats to be stationed at a travel agency in the country to give their nationals consular support. Conscious of domestic opinion, however, it has insisted the measures are strictly temporary and not steps towards a normalisation agreement of the kind signed by several other Arab states in recent years.
Though neither Israel nor Palestine are playing in the tournament, the latter has featured prominently at the Middle Easts first World Cup. Before Sundays opening match, a phalanx of Qatari men marched into the Al Bayt Stadium chanting, Everyone is welcome, carrying with them a large Palestinian flag. We are taking care of people in Palestine, and all Muslim people and Arab countries are holding up Palestinian flags because were for them, the flag bearer told the Guardian.
Fans from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Algeria have also carried Palestinian flags prominently at matches and worn them as capes around their necks. On Thursday, Randa Ahmer, a young Palestinian woman, stood in Dohas bustling Souq Waqif holding a Palestinian flag above the international crowd. Its our country, were going to carry our flag everywhere, she said, as passersby shouted messages of support.
Fifa trumpeted its agreement with Qatar to allow Israelis to fly to Doha by claiming the deal also allowed Palestinians to make the journey from Tel Aviv, but nearly a week into the tournament, it was unclear how many had been able to surmount the extensive Israeli security checks required to make the journey. Some of those who had made it to Qatar had come via Jordan or Egypt.
As of the beginning of the tournament, nearly 4,000 Israeli and 8,000 Palestinian fans had received entry visas to Qatar, though Israels foreign minister said it was expected as many as 20,000 Israelis could ultimately end up going.
A kosher kitchen has been set up near Dohas airport to provide Israeli fans with a place to gather and food that conforms with religious requirements.
Preparing to arrive in Doha over the weekend, Duby Nevo, an Israeli national, said he was watching the reports of Palestinian activism at the tournament with some concern. I hope that Qataris are welcoming and everything will be fine, he said. I really hope to meet people from all over the world and especially from Arabic countries  if they want to make friends. I just want to enjoy [the football], no conflicts whatsoever.
Another Israeli man, who gave only his first name Bahaa, said the organisation of the tournament and atmosphere in the country were excellent, but there was one drawback: The majority of the masses here do not accept the presence of Israelis.
Others said they were finding a welcoming environment, but taking precautions. Were not afraid to be here in Qatar as Israelis, they are very kind and we dont feel the politics between the countries, said Omer Laufer. Sometimes we say that we are from Cyprus  but just to people from Arab countries.

As the viral videos have shown, it is Israeli media outlets that have borne the brunt of the lingering antipathy with which their country is regarded by Arab populations, even if many of their governments have now signed agreements acknowledging Israeli sovereignty, started building trade ties and brought their security cooperation out into the open.
Israels Channel 13 sports reporter Tal Shorrer told Associated Press that while his interactions with Qatari officials had been pleasant, he had been shoved and insulted by Palestinians and other Arab fans during his live broadcasts from the city.
When a mobile phone seller noticed his friends settings in Hebrew, Shorrer said the man exploded with anger, screaming at the Israeli to get out of the country.
I was so excited to come in with an Israeli passport, thinking it was going to be something positive, he said. Its sad, its unpleasant. People were cursing and threatening us.
On Friday, a reporter from Israels public broadcaster Kan had a more enjoyable brush with fans, mobbed by jubilant Iranian supporters celebrating their 2-0 victory over Wales, who dressed him a jesters hat in the national colours while anchors back in the studio watched on, laughing.

Aware of the sensitivities of a tournament that will attract thousands of arrivals from hostile countries such as Iran, and where unlike in previous tournaments, all of the estimated 1.2 million foreign fans will be living cheek-by-jowl in one city, Israeli diplomats have produced videos asking their nationals to keep a low profile.
Downplay your Israeli presence and Israeli identity for the sake of your personal security, said Lior Haiat, an Israeli diplomat, addressing fans."

They are carrying visitors along the crest of a sand dune whose slopes are scarred by the tracks of overland vehicles and SUVs. At the bottom, a gargantuan Chevrolet advertisement offers alternative transport options and a long line of semi-permanent structures hawks tourist trinkets. This is the gateway to a region Qatar hopes will bewitch those who want a break from the football: a near-empty expanse of undulating sand that covers the countrys south-eastern interior and is marketed as an outdoor adventurers playground.
In truth it hardly resembles a honeypot and that is how its temporary residents like it. The Saudi Football Association stole in quickly to secure this base, at the exclusive Sealine beach resort, two and a half years ago. It is only 25 miles from the border with their country and, an hours drive south of Doha, feels cut off from the inner citys manic energy. They knew from the experience of 2019, when Qatar hosted the Gulf Cup, that the noise and logjams of an urban centre present unwelcome hurdles over the course of a tournament.
So it is to the quiet backdrop of those dunes and, 100 metres in the other direction, a palm-fringed stretch of sand that Hervé Renard leads his players out for practice. The complex is closed to everyone bar the Saudi setup, their loved ones, operational personnel and a small number of visitors who have purchased day passes for a sectioned-off area of beach. One describes himself as a guest of the emir; it is the footballers, though, who have reaped the most obvious benefits of local hospitality.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Its an unbelievable feeling but we were talking about this and, if we want it to last, we have to qualify from the group, says Saleh al-Shehri, who scored the equaliser against Argentina and set in train one of the World Cups great upsets. Saudi Arabia face Poland next and their task is to repeat the intensity and bravery that bent proceedings to their will last time out. Saturdays opponents may be considered a rung down from Argentina but Renards side would still ordinarily be viewed as underdogs.
Three points would, contrary to every initial expectation, guarantee their first knockout assignment since the Saeed al-Owairan-fuelled campaign at USA 94. All the odds were against us, Shehri says. We believe in ourselves and we worked hard to get here because it wasnt easy. And I think we proved to everyone that we are worthy of being here.
Success inevitably begets greed for more but there is an awareness back home that, even if the Saudis fall short from hereon, they have already earned a place in legend. Perhaps they are at their best when the pressure is off. Last month Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, met the squad and told them to be comfortable, play and enjoy the tournament. That request has been fulfilled so far.
Nonetheless excitement will be at fever pitch on Saturday and venues such as Mrsool Park, a stadium in Riyadh that has been given over to a fan park and giant screen, will teem with anticipation. We have to make our country and our fans proud, Shehri continues. Going through is a dream for us: to get back there after all these years would be amazing.
Before the session starts, Renard stands in deep conversation with Yasser al-Misehal, the FA president. Misehal makes his way back around the pitch and is soon joined, in the modest bank of seats erected for onlookers, by Renards parents. Their arrival brings spontaneous applause: families have been allowed to join the players and staff today, adding to the close-knit feel around a setup happy to be at a remove from the external gaze.

That is where most of the Saudi squad spend their time. They are all domestic-based and only the most dedicated of football followers from further-flung regions could reel off their names before Tuesday. It means that they have no secrets from each other and, having spent a two-month training camp together in the runup to Qatar 2022, felt ready to surprise the outside world. I think weve developed a lot, Shehri says. Its a chance to prove to everyone that Saudi football is getting better day by day.
Physical duels will, he suggested, be decisive against Poland. It will be a different kind of challenge, perhaps an equally imposing one if Robert Lewandowski has mended his radar, but the opportunity ahead is alluring. During the group stage about 200,000 Saudis are expected to visit Qatar for the party: that number would swell considerably with progress to the last 16. Shehri can see the prize. We made history and there is still more to come, inshallah, he says.
Driving north back towards the capital, along near-empty highways, flares leap high into the darkening sky from the stacks of a sprawling oil refinery that adjoins the stretch of shore next to Sealine. The contrast with the wandering dromedaries is stark and there is a sense that, in this short trip to the Saudis base, the raw materials powering the host countrys month-long festival have been set in microcosm.
Saudi Arabia, whose country has its own tension between the private and the tableau shown to the public, intend to keep global eyes on the brighter side this weekend."

There are no visiting supporters, no women, no team colours and certainly no beer. The clue is in the venue: a cricket stadium on the edge of Doha. Inside, thousands of mostly south Asian low-wage labourers, fill the stands or sit cross-legged on the grassy outfield.
It is a world away from the polished face of Doha that most fans will see. The stadium fan zone is within Asian Town, a shopping and entertainment complex purpose-built for Qatars migrant workers about 30 minutes by car from the city centre. A vast expanse of warehouses, workshops and accommodation blocks stretches out for miles on one side, housing hundreds of thousands of workers, often in grim, crowded dorms.
On a wall near the entrance to the fan zone, a banner in Arabic, English and Hindi reads: Thanks for your contributions for delivering the best Fifa World Cup ever.
Many here probably played a part in building the stadiums and infrastructure for the tournament, but gratitude has its limits. While some match tickets went on sale for Qatar residents for just 40 rials (£9), no one the Guardian spoke to had managed to get one. Any that were available were far too expensive for workers who earn as little as £225 a month.
Without a match ticket, they are unable to register for a Hayya card, which is needed to enter the main fan zones in Doha. Even if they could, the efficient and cheap Metro does not reach this part of the city, forcing workers to take more costly alternatives.
The fan zone, and Asian Town itself, highlight the parallel lives that many migrant workers inhabit. Critics say it entrenches divisions, the unspoken message being: you can have your restaurants, shops and fan zone, as long as you dont come to ours.
As the match between Spain and Costa Rica kicks off, Dilip Kumar Mandal from Nepal looks thrilled. I come every night. I like the environment, he says. Asked which team he is supporting, he pauses and says, The red one.
Id like to be in a stadium, but I have no money. Whatever I earn, I have to send home for my childrens education, he adds.
Mandal, a mason, is just happy to be there. Before the World Cup began, 350 of his workmates were ordered home, as his company, like many others, wound down its work on instructions from the government.
As Spain score their first goal, he punches the air. Yes! I knew theyd score, he says, his face glowing red in the light of the giant screen.
Sitting nearby, Stephen* from Ghana works at the airport, transferring inflight meals to the planes. Its his day off, but during the week, All I do is work, sleep, work, sleep, work, sleep, he says. Like Dilip, he could not afford a match ticket, but unlike him, he speaks about football as fluently as the Spanish play it. As another goal slides in, he enthuses about Ghanas chances: I just hope I can get off work to watch them, he says.

As half-time approaches, hundreds surge towards the stage, and are soon rewarded, not by another goal, but by an MC and her four female dancers. She gives a shoutout to, My African friends, before reeling off the other countries that make up the bulk of Qatars migrant workforce: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Philippines.
There are no team colours or flags on display. With the exception of Ghana, none of these nations qualified for the World Cup and so decisions about who to support appear to be determined by a favourite player or the colour of a shirt.
In the stands, Mohammed Malik from Bangladesh says he comes to watch the matches every day. He has nothing better to do. My company stopped sending us to work because we cant access our worksite during the World Cup. Theyve stopped paying us too, says the 42-year-old carpenter.
Yam Kumar Rajbanshi, a forklift operator, is another regular in the fan zone. I come every night. I love football more than cricket. Brazil will win, he says confidently. Rajbanshi, from Nepal, said a ticket for a match cost too much  half his monthly salary  but he did not seem to care. Its better to watch here!

As the host country, Qatar, frantically completed its plans, there were even hints of glee as finishing touches fell short. Potholed atriums, expensive rooms, an overrun airport and even the last-minute beer ban were met with knowing smirks from many Gulf citizens who refused to share in the bonhomie.
But four days into footballs showpiece, with Arab teams performing beyond expectations and Saudi Arabias giant-killers in particular shining bright, the World Cup has come to life across a region that is taking a belated collective pride. From the United Arab Emirates to Morocco and most points in between, the global sporting event of the year is now being fully embraced.
Not long ago, we were all foes with Qatar, said Salah al-Oleimi, a Saudi businessman from Jeddah. Their airspace was closed, trade was banned, and there were no diplomatic ties, he said of the three-year boycott  by four Middle Eastern countries led by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Everything shut down. We didnt see a Qatari for five years.
But now things are in the past. Football is a great leveller.
In Dubai, a 30-minute flight from Doha, there was next to no sign of the approaching World Cup just days out from the opening match. But cafes along the citys Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard were full on Wednesday as Germany lost to Japan, and teeming with fans a day earlier after the Saudi sides memorable win over Argentina.
Political rivalry had never been far away from how the Gulf states viewed Qatars winning bid to host the World Cup and had been central to its ambivalence since. The GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] is a bunch of feuding cousins who dont really like each other, said an Emirati official. But footballs given us a reason to get along for a while.
In Kuwait, another GCC member, there was much praise for the performances of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia, and some satisfaction at rival Irans drubbing by England. But there was also a touch of envy about Qatar playing host.
May God bless them and help us. Weve had no achievements to celebrate, wrote one Kuwaiti fan on Instagram. I swear we are bothered by all the Gulf countries, wrote another Kuwaiti. They show a commitment to football and fans, and we have the biggest support base in the region.
Buoyed up by its teams 2-1 win over Argentina, Saudi Arabia is now fully behind the event. Prince Mohammed was seen praying and embracing relatives after the game, and Qatars emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, briefly draped himself in a Saudi flag  an unthinkable gesture during the former political crisis  winning broad praise across social media. In our neighbourhood, personal dignities are paramount and gestures like this can have historical implications, said Nowf al-Saud, a Riyadh-based student.
The growing embrace of the World Cup is in contrast to the reaction in the UK and in many European countries, where Qatars record with migrant workers who built its seven stadiums and attitude to LGBTQ+ rights continues to draw scathing headlines.
There is little buy-in to either criticism across the Gulf, which was largely built on migrant labour and where homosexuality remains outlawed. Lets just concentrate on sport, said a Bahraini merchant, Ahmad Fakhro. The cultural issues are for another day. When this event was awarded, the societal stands of the host were known. The values they promote are those of this region.
Qataris have framed the scrutiny their country has received as racist or part of a hostile campaign directed by foreign enemies.
It is systematically orchestrated, said a businessman in the gas industry who declined to be named. We want to sustain our way of life, why are we hated for that? Do you think there is no abuse in Europe?
Mubaraka al-Marri, a businesswoman and social activist in Doha, said: We know the media is one of the tools which is used to affect people. Its like a war. You dont need to use guns or fight countries or harm these countries, you use the media.
Mohammad al-Qassabi, 22, a graduate from a Doha university, said: What Ive noticed is that many have some stereotypes about some Gulf countries and some of them are wrong. But he claimed to see an upside: When the European and western media is describing the World Cup as a failure, but then it happens to be a success, everyone will be impressed. If they have low expectations its easier to impress them.
Outside the region, the event has routinely been labelled the most controversial World Cup ever and organisers have been accused of ignoring Fifa directives banning discrimination and offering equal access. World footballs global body has been accused of ignoring its own values. Rainbow flags and scarves have been confiscated from fans outside stadiums and guards have stopped displays of public affection.
This is a clash of values, said an Emirati fan in Dubai. Lets move past it. I hope the clash of teams is remembered more.

The Denmark international footballer wrote on Instagram that her mother, Hadima Nadim, 57, had been killed in a collision with a truck on her way home from the gym on Tuesday.
The 34-year-old was part of ITVs coverage of Denmarks 0-0 draw with Tunisia in Qatar but had to leave the studio before the final whistle.
Nadim, her four sisters and their mother fled Afghanistan when she was 11, having been in hiding for three years after her father Rabani, an army general, was executed by the Taliban in 2000.
The former Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain forward wrote: Tuesday morning my Mother was killed by a truck. She was on her way back from the gym.
Words cannot describe what Im feeling. I have lost the most important person in my life and it happened so sudden and unexpected.
She was only 57. She was a warrior who had fought for every inch of her life.
She didnt give me life once but twice, and everything I/we are is because of her.
I have lost my home and I know nothings gonna ever feel the same. Life is unfair and I dont understand why her and why this way. I love you and I will see you again.
Nadim, who plays for National Womens Soccer League club Racing Louisville FC in the US, added: Her funeral is going to be soon  please come and show her the love, respect and prayers she deserves.

After Nadims fathers death, Nadims mother sold all of their possessions to take a minivan to Karachi, southern Pakistan, where they waited two months for fake passports before taking a flight to Italy.
The family spent days hiding in a basement in Milan, then 50 hours in the back of a truck to reach what they were told was London, but turned out to be a refugee camp in rural Denmark, where Nadim discovered her love for playing football."

More than five years after failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and nearly eight-and-a-half years since their most recent appearance at the tournament, the second-youngest team in Qatar were making a swaggering return to the sports biggest stage.
Christian Pulisic was dribbling out of pressure, running at defenders and creating attacking chances from nothing. Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson were making swashbuckling overlapping runs and firing away from distance with confidence and verve. The gifted midfield trio of Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Yunus Musah were doing the lung-bursting box-to-box handiwork that have become their hallmark. One of the youngest teams the United States has ever fielded at a World Cup, operating with a collective poise and composure beyond their experience level and an edge of aggression promised by their manager, kept rapping at the door until bursting through with a goal nine minutes before half-time.
Even as Wales fine-tuned their tactics and ramped up the pressure after half-time, the young Americans held their nerve and appeared bound for three points and a dream start. That is, until the 82nd minute, when US center-back Walker Zimmerman recklessly hacked down Gareth Bale from behind in the penalty area with his opponents back to goal. By the time the Nashville SC defenders animated reaction (No, no, no, no!) was picked up by the television cameras, the referee was pointing to the spot.
Within moments, Bale had fired the penalty past the fingertips of Matt Turner to rescue a point for the team the Welshman almost single-handedly carried back to their first World Cup finals since 1958.
From his vantage point, [Zimmerman] thought he was going to be first to the ball, Berhalter said after the game. It is what it is.
There may be no more frequently cited reason for optimism around the United States these days than just how many Americans  far more than ever before  have gone abroad to ply their trade during their teenage years. More than half of Berhalters 26-man squad for Qatar compete in the worlds top five leagues, including Pulisic (Chelsea), McKennie (Juventus), Dest (Milan) and Adams (Leeds United), the teams newly minted captain.
Berhalters team selection for Mondays match, and how he valued MLS-based players in a contest the United States simply couldnt afford to lose, spoke volumes. All but one of his 11 starters represented clubs in Europe, the highest number ever for a US lineup in a World Cup match. Six players feature in England, two in Italy, and one each in France and Spain. The lone starter from Major League Soccer? You might have guessed it.
Thats not to pick on Zimmerman, who cant be feeling particularly good about costing his team so dearly on their World Cup return. Nor on Americas top division, which has made enormous strides in quality since its inception a quarter-century ago and continues to do so much to grow the game stateside.
But for those who believe the United States wont truly be able to contend at the World Cup as long as MLS players are featuring in the national team, well  it is what it is.
Even as the United States showed growing pains in the extended run-up to Qatar, Berhalter has resisted the notion that his aggressive youth movement was more about looking ahead to the World Cup four years from now, when the US will be co-hosts and todays core players will be in their presumptive primes. We want to build a ton of momentum going into 2026, he said last week. But it all starts now.
He wasnt kidding. And the first half of Mondays match offered a glimmer of the higher ground where the US team could be headed. But Zimmermans costly blunder showed just how far the Americans have to go while largely brushing aside what should have been the story of the night: Tim Weah scoring for the United States at the tournament his famous father never got to play in.

It isnt always easy being the son of a head of state, much less the offspring of the greatest African footballer who ever lived. The shadow cast by George Weah  star striker for AS Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain and Milan and the only African winner of Fifas World Player of the Year and the Ballon dOr  was a lengthy one even before he was elected president of Liberia.
The younger Weah was eligible to play for France, Jamaica and Liberia through residency and his parents citizenships, but opted for the United States (he was born in New York and spent parts of his childhood there and in Florida) and came up through the US youth system. After scoring on his international debut in a 2018 friendly against Bolivia and becoming the fourth-youngest player to score a goal for the US, Weah managed to maintain a foothold in the team despite a brutal litany of injuries.
On Monday, Berhalters faith paid off handsomely when Weah, now 22, conjured the would-be winner following a burst forward and perfectly threaded pass by Pulisic. That made him the first player to score against Wales in a World Cup since a 17-year-old upstart named Pele eliminated them from the quarter-finals back in 1958.
Now the United States look ahead to Fridays match with England and next Tuesdays group-stage finale against Iran, who famously eliminated the US from the 1998 World Cup. The path to the knockout stage is still right there from Berhalters romper room, only more difficult than it needed to be.

English-language daily the Peninsula enthused about the opening ceremony, writing: To the entire world and all those in attendance, it was a promise delivered in spectacular fashion. While hosting the World Cup is often a once-in-a lifetime opportunity, given the global interest in hosting the Mondial, the world can give Qatar a thumbs up for delivering on its promises.
The Gulf Times singled out Qatari Ghanim al-Muftah for praise, saying he had shone at the opening ceremony. Born with Caudal regression syndrome, a disorder that impairs the development of the lower spine, Muftah is a local social media celebrity who walks on his hands, and who, in dialogue with Morgan Freeman, spoke on inclusion and diversity and quoted the Quran.
The pro-government semi-official paper of Qatar, Al Raya, went beyond the call of duty in praising the man who drove Qatar to bid for the World Cup, the Emir. In an editorial following the Emirs speech at the opening ceremony, it wrote: We are overwhelmed with feelings of love, gratitude and pride in our wise leadership, which always strives to raise the name of Qatar above the cloud.
Muhammad Al-Marri in the Al-Watan wrote: The truth shone like a sun in the middle of the day. And the dream turned into a tangible reality. Those who know Qatar, its leadership, and its people bet on its victory and won. As for those who doubted and promoted lies and spread fallacies, their loss was heavy and their end painful.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
And the verdict on the football? Also a painful loss.
In a press conference after the match, Qatars Spanish coach, Félix Sánchez, was pressed on whether modifying the formation and style of play of the team had lead to the loss. He told reporters the national team still has a lot to offer in its next match  against Senegal on Friday  and they did not appear at their true level.
Focus for much criticism had been the goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, who flapped at a cross leading to Ecuadors early disallowed goal, and then conceded the penalty with which Enner Valencia opened the scoring. After the game Sheeb insisted: There are two remaining matches in which we can make amends.
In its match report the Peninsular raised questions about the teams preparations, with journalist Fawad Hussain writing: Qatar fans were expecting a much better show. The hosts failed to register a single shot on target in their historic match. Perhaps, Qatar succumbed to the pressure of winning on their World Cup debut in front of their home fans. Al Annabi didnt look a side said to be the best prepared team of this World Cup, with all the players being kept out of the countrys top flight league to train at isolated camps offshore for more than four months.

In the Gulf Times, Sahan Bidappa wrote: The manner in which they crumbled against Ecuador would have disappointed the home fans, many of whom were observed leaving long before the match had ended. The paper lamented: This was supposed to be Qatars easiest fixture.
Bidappa said: As the Qatar players failed to impose themselves on the game, coach Sánchez stared at the roof of the tent-shaped architecture marvel Al Bayt Stadium, wondering what he or his players could have done differently on the night. In reality, not much,.
He added of the team on the biggest stage of their lives, Qatar players looked frozen, clearly overawed by the historic occasion. This was a nervous and disjointed performance."

In a city constructed on sand, the gentlest of breezes makes it near impossible to prevent the desert from intruding on an otherwise gleaming capital well accustomed to accommodating forces of nature.
It is playing host to another one right now, in the shape of a striker capable of making the worlds best defenders feel as helpless as Qatars street cleaners.
Although Robert Lewandowski spends most days closeted in the team hotel, he is a ubiquitous presence here. Once darkness falls, and it descends early in the Gulf at this time of year, giant images of the Poland captain and record goalscorer illuminate the sides of skyscrapers lining the citys Corniche.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Up in the skies above the Arabian Sea countless stacked Qatar Airways flights circle as they queue to land at Hamad airport. Before takeoff passengers may have been slightly surprised to watch Lewandowski starring in a football-themed safety video.
Whereas his fellow part-time actor, Brazils Neymar, is merely seen escorting business-class passengers to their seats, the 34-year-old demonstrates how to pull on a life jacket in the event of an unscheduled landing on water.
Given that responsibility and Lewandowski are no strangers, it seems appropriate casting. Playing for Poland definitely carries massive pressure, agrees a striker hoping to guide his country to victory against Mexico in their opening group game on Tuesday. Im acutely conscious of the responsibility of meeting our fans expectations. They grow with every goal. No matter who were playing and what challenges we face, everyone expects me to score  but its not always easy.
He will be shouldering the hopes of, among others, half the clientele of LAutre, a Polish-Mexican restaurant in Londons Mayfair who know a win would appreciably enhance Czeslaw Michniewiczs teams chances of escaping the tournaments group stage for the first time in 36 years. An evocative photograph of Argentina 1978 hangs proudly on LAutres wall, depicting the scenes when the two countries last met at a World Cup and Poland won 3-1.
Considering Lewandowskis age, a repeat could offer him not merely a ticket out of a group also featuring Argentina and Saudi Arabia but an extended last hurrah on the global stage. I dont think this will be my last World Cup though, says a player clearly minded to rage against the dying of the light. I want to play in the next one too.
Given that Lewangoalski has scored 18 times in 19 appearance for Barcelona this season and remains feted in Germany  where he played under Jürgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund and Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich  it would be unwise to doubt him. Both coaches admired the work ethic of a 6ft 1in forward who did not finish growing until he was 20 and compensated for this late physical development by not only becoming two-footed but expert in the air.
Such dedication paid off handsomely, helping him to 76 goals in 134 Poland appearances and a quintet of coronations as Bundesliga player of the year. Lewandowskis place in the firmament of the worlds greatest centre-forwards is assured thanks to more than 500 career goals, but something significant is missing from an otherwise near-perfect CV.
Despite that compelling blend of superior movement, stellar technique and sheer power, he is still to score at a World Cup. In mitigation, Polands failure to qualify in 2010 and 2014 dictate he has participated in the group stage of only one finals  Russia 2018.

Russia was one of the biggest disappointments of my career, mostly because we didnt create any opportunities, he says. I didnt have any chances and that still hurts. That was a failure. To score at a World Cup is a huge dream and Im going to do everything to make this dream happen.
Further inspiration is provided by the famous Poland teams of 1974 and 1982 who recorded third-place World Cup finishes, with Grzegorz Lato winning the Golden Boot at West Germany 1974 after scoring seven goals. Ill do well to beat Lato  were not a team that creates a huge number of chances, acknowledges Lewandowski.
Lato entered politics after retiring from playing, and Lewandowski is widely lauded for his philanthropy and charity work. It is perhaps partly a consequence of Klopps influence as an almost surrogate parent  the striker was only 16 when his father died and he has credited the German with offering him invaluable off-field guidance  that Lewandowski has such a balanced, mature equilibrium on and off the pitch.
Argentina will be our toughest match, says a man who feels Guardiola taught him fresh and invaluable tactical thought. But Ill be very happy to play against [Lionel] Messi. Hes changed football for the better, for ever.
Although he believes a solid, tactically smart Saudi Arabia should not be underestimated, Mexico represent the immediate challenge. Theyre a tough team who fight all the way to the final whistle and never give up, he says. They know how to play at major tournaments. Theyll be a big test. But well play every match with smiles on our faces and as a unit. Even if its very tough Ill enjoy it."

Their outdoor screens can be viewed from the pavement, however. Sorry, sir, you cant stand there, says a polite but firm security guard. Move along, sir.
Moving along through the bustling alleyways and squares there is little evidence to support the assertion of Qatars head coach, Félix Sánchez, that this will be an extraordinary day like no other. At least not in Souq Waqif, a rare example of Qatari architecture in Doha where market stalls and shisha lounges abound and TV stations from around the globe have set up studios for that authentic backdrop (Souq Waqif was renovated in 2006).
The Bulgaria great Hristo Stoichkov brings a touch of World Cup authenticity by conducting an interview near a huge golden thumb. Nearby three Mexico fans in Arab dress, including one in a wrestling mask, are appearing on local TV. Otherwise there are more journalists searching for World Cup fans than fans  local or otherwise  looking to watch the opening game of what Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, would contest is a ground-breaking World Cup. Old men push wheelbarrows through the streets and the pavement cafes are mainly filled with locals smoking shisha pipes.
It was a different and more disturbing picture at the Fifa Fan Festival at Al Bidda Park further up the Corniche. The venue has an official capacity of 40,000 but for the second day since it opened there were chaotic scenes at the venue. Organisers allowed too many fans to enter the site before kick-off. One report estimated that double the capacity had tried to gain entry. They were kept in a holding area between the main festival park and the perimeter entrance before being shepherded back out.
It was dangerous, one fan carrying a child aged nearly four, who had exited the holding area, said. They let too many people in. We never made it into the main area and I was glad to leave. Police took about 45 minutes to clear the excess fans amid angry scenes. Another headache for Fifa, which has somehow managed to add to the controversies surrounding the tournament in recent days.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Fans are encouraged to descend on Al Bidda Park  where Fifa sponsors such as Budweiser get to sell their wares, alcoholic or zero (taste)  because options to immerse themselves in the World Cup experience elsewhere in Doha are complicated to say the least. Many visitors arrived at their expensive hotels to find the price does not include access to watching matches on TV. Many hotels balked at paying the host broadcaster BeIN Sports a subscription fee of 100,000 Qatari riyals (£23,105 at todays exchange rate) to show the World Cup in their restaurants, bars and rooms. The same goes for owners of private villas and apartments that are being rented out to fans from around the world. Off to the Fifa Fan Festival it is then, providing you have an official Hayya pass.
The appropriately named La Boca is another restaurant showing the World Cup opener in Souq Waqif. But elsewhere, and despite a few cheers when Ecuadors early goal was disallowed, it is Sunday business as usual. On the hours walk to the Souq via the lively Al Jazeera Street there is the occasional sight of Qataris embracing a moment of huge sporting significance for the Arab world. Families also gather in front of a large screen in Millennium Plaza children, women and men all dressed in Qatar kit  and cheer every time the national teams coach appears on screen en route to Al Bayt Stadium almost 50kms north of Doha.

Outside a pet shop near Souq Waqif Hassan and five of his friends sit watching a laptop screen buffer repeatedly during the opening ceremony. Their despair over the Wifi signal does not detract from their warm hospitality. A plastic chair and a coffee is brought out of the shop for the passing journalist from England. This is the biggest day in the world and it is happening here. You must understand how important that is, says Hassan. Whatever happens in the game, we have already won. Qatar might say that was the point. The laptop starts buffering again."

Qatar has been attacked for its treatment of migrant workers, allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the tournament and its record on LGBTQ and womens rights. Broadcasters such as the BBC and Telemundo chose to highlight those concerns in their coverage of the first day of the tournament, where the hosts lost to Ecuador after a lavish opening ceremony that included contributions from Morgan Freeman and Jungkook from BTS.

In contrast, Fox heaped praise on everything from the air-conditioning in the Al Bayt Stadium to the variety of food available to fans to the very welcoming secretary general of Qatars World Cup committee, Hassan Al-Thawadi. A puff piece with Al-Thawadi followed in which he was allowed to speak in glowing terms about the World Cup with no questions from interviewer Jenny Taft about concerns raised by journalists and human rights groups.
This is how BBC opened coverage of World Cup 2022. Stark contrast to Fox Coverage in United States. Please take a minute to watch. This is how this World Cup should be contextualized ?? pic.twitter.com/36HtKOX26w
Roger Bennett, the influential co-host of the Men In Blazers podcast, posted a clip of the BBCs coverage and wrote: This is how BBC opened coverage of World Cup 2022. Stark contrast to Fox Coverage in United States. Please take a minute to watch. This is how this World Cup should be contextualized.
Grant Wahl, arguably the most prominent soccer journalist in the US, also tweeted a link to the BBCs opening day coverage and wrote: Big contrast between the Qatar regime-aligned coverage in the United States on Fox Sports and the coverage on the UK rights-holder.
Other viewers on Twitter asked Fox to chill out on the propaganda and to stop shilling for Qatar.
In the lead-up to the World Cup, Fox executive producer David Neal said he did not believe viewers wanted to be distracted by off-field issues during the tournament.
We really believe viewers come to us at Fox Sports for the World Cup to see the World Cup, he said. Qatar Airways, the countrys state-owned airline, is a major sponsor of Foxs World Cup coverage.
In contrast, Telemundo, which owns the Spanish language broadcast rights for the World Cup in the US, said it intended to take a stronger line than Fox.
I do think we have to talk about the legacy we leave. By the time the tournaments over, we [wont have been] ignoring the geopolitical issues that might arise, said Telemundo Deportes president Ray Warren.
The US team at the World Cup have made a striking, if subtle, statement about their views. They have prominently displayed a rainbow logo at the teams training facility in a country where homosexuality is illegal.
It is not just Stateside that we want to bring attention to social issues, it is also abroad, said US head coach Gregg Berhalter this week. We recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress but theres some work still to do."

As Irans government faces its most critical moment since the Islamic revolution in 1979, Hajsafi, a left-back at AEK Athens, on Sunday night addressed a press conference before his teams opening World Cup group game against England in Doha on Monday.
We have to accept the conditions in our country are not right and our people are not happy, he said. We are here but it does not mean we should not be their voice or we must not respect them.
Whatever we have is from them. We have to fight. We have to perform and score some goals to present the brave people of Iran with a result. I hope conditions change as to the expectations of the people.
A popular uprising has been gaining momentum since September after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22?year?old detained by the countrys morality police for allegedly not covering her head properly.
Since then protests against the rules forcing women to wear the hijab have expanded into widespread discontent with the countrys strict theocracy, with more than 380 people said to have been killed by security forces.
England (4-2-3-1 probable): Pickford; Trippier, Stones, Maguire, Shaw; Bellingham, Rice; Saka, Mount, Sterling; Kane.
Iran (4-1-4-1 probable): Beiranvand; Moharrami, Kanaanizadegan, M Hosseini, Hajsafi; Ezatolahi; Jahanbakhsh, Nourollahi, Ghoddos, Amiri; Taremi.
As a byproduct Carlos Queirozs team have been placed in the unenviable position of being required to represent the Islamic republic while being under intense pressure to support millions of protesting compatriots. The situation in Iran is very difficult, said Hajsafi, who is aware human rights groups have called for Irans expulsion from the World Cup.
Tellingly, before taking questions he opened by offering support for those who had lost loved ones during the recent turmoil. I would like to express my condolences to all the bereaved families, he said. They should know we are with them, we support them and we sympathise with them.
A key moment will arrive shortly before kick-off when members of a squad thought to be still slightly divided as to how to respond must take individual decisions as to whether to sing a national anthem, all about glorifying the 1979 revolution.
It all dictated that, at the end of a day in which light winds whipped through Doha, creating piles of dust at almost every turn, Queiroz found himself at the eye of a diplomatic sandstorm he opted to ignore on Sunday.
Irans Portuguese coach, and former assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, preferred to concentrate on a different type of whirlwind. England have a storm of talent, the 69-year-old said as he smothered Gareth Southgate with flattery. England are one of the top teams in the world. They are a contender to be world champion. They have fantastic, strong talent and a great coach.

It will be the first time Queiroz has faced England and he claimed not to have sought any advice from Ferguson. I did not receive any help from Scotland, he said. Of course we talk frequently as friends. But you can relax!
He then launched into an ode to English players, claiming they were superior to the team of recent predecessors dominated by David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes. This new generation of players Southgate is bringing for the national team in my opinion is probably the most competitive English team since 1966 that I have the opportunity to see  and I remember that team very well. But this team is very functional, very practical, very realistic.
I worked with the generation of Rio, of Paul Scholes. Fantastic players, David Beckham and all those guys. But this national team is really different. They make a realistic approach to every single game which makes them very, very dangerous.
Although Queiroz said Iran believed they could reach the knockout stage he confessed Monday would contain a surreal quality. For many of our players to play against England is like magic, its a gift, he said. Since watching football as kids, its been a lifelong dream for my players to play in this game. We will enjoy it."

What it probably did not expect was that the BBC would ignore the entire event in favour of a broadcast criticising the treatment of migrant workers, highlighting corruption at Fifa and discussing the ban on homosexuality in Qatar. And that was just in the opening two minutes.
Its the most controversial World Cup in history and a ball hasnt even been kicked, said the Match of the Day host Gary Lineker as he welcomed viewers to the start of the national broadcasters coverage on BBC One.
Ever since Fifa chose Qatar back in 2010, the smallest nation to have hosted footballs greatest competition has faced some big questions  from accusations of corruption in the bidding process to the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums where many lost their lives. Homosexuality is illegal here. Womens rights and freedom of expression are in the spotlight. Also, the decision six years ago to switch the World Cup from summer to winter.
He concluded: Against that backdrop, theres a tournament to be played  one that will be watched and enjoyed around the world. Stick to football, say Fifa. Well, we will  for a couple of minutes at least.
What followed was an evisceration of the political skulduggery and corruption that led to the worlds best footballers gathering in Doha in the middle of the European winter.
The BBC declined to explain why it had shunted coverage of the opening ceremony  traditionally an opportunity for host countries to project soft power around the world  to an online-only stream. Viewers in other countries saw Jung Kook, one of the most famous singers in the world, perform his new song  sample inspirational lyric: Look who we are, we are the dreamers / Well make it happen because we believe it  in a packed stadium. At the same moment, BBC One viewers were watching the presenter Ros Atkins introduce an interview with Amnesty International and state: Weve never seen a World Cup with a carbon footprint like this before.
Even the former footballers brought in to analyse the actual sport for the BBC broke down any pretence that politics should be kept out of football. The former England international Alex Scott mocked Fifas chief, Gianni Infantino, for suggesting he could feel solidarity with migrant workers and the expense of attending the World Cup. You will never know what it is like to be a migrant worker. To keep saying football is for everyone  its not. You cant say football is for everyone, Scott said.
The former England captain Alan Shearer went further. If he feels that strong about the migrant workers and their families, Amnesty has been asking Fifa for just over $400m in a compensation fund. They havent agreed to that. Why? Shearer asked.
Rather than Dohas preferred narrative of a tiny Arab country uniting the world with football, viewers in the UK were left in no doubt that the World Cup was mired in accusations of bribery and that Qatar was a deeply flawed host country.
There was, of course, an alternative to the BBCs coverage. Viewers watching in the UK on Freeview could have watched the buildup on Al Jazeera, the English-language rolling news channel funded by the Qatari government. There there was acknowledgement of the criticisms but the event was presented in the context of incredible advances in infrastructure in Doha.
While the BBC highlighted again and again the deaths of migrant workers, Al Jazeera showed construction staff meeting the England team, as a voiceover intoned: Had it not been for the beautiful game, these two groups of men, with their different languages and backgrounds, might never have met. But football has brought them together.
Back on the BBC, there was no such niceties, although Lineker did push Shearer to address the parallels with his boyhood club Newcastle United riding high thanks to enormous Saudi Arabian investment.
We as fans dont get to choose where the World Cup is, just like we dont get to choose who invests in our football clubs, replied Shearer, highlighting some of the nuance associated with being a fan in an era of sportswashing campaigns.
And then, after half an hour, the programme rapidly shifted towards discussion of football  the tactics, the egos, the lineups, the optimism, the potential winners, the likely losers, the adverts for alcohol sponsors who cannot sell alcohol, the likelihood of Qatar or Ecuador, playing the opening match, making it out of the group stage  and, eventually, 22 people kicking a ball around a pitch.
But BBC viewers had just seen something unusual: a television broadcaster with the rights to show the worlds biggest sporting event choosing to comprehensively trash the product it was about to serve up."

To make a truly memorable one you need to get Diana Ross to hopelessly miss a penalty or Robbie Williams to give the TV audience his middle finger. Many have interpreted Qatar hosting this World Cup as being about sportswashing their international image and no expense was spared on the 30-minute show that preceded the opening fixture between Qatar and Ecuador. Here is what we learned
An opening video sequence saw a dream to kick progress from an infant in the womb to become a procession through the desert leading to the tent-shaped Al Bayt Stadium, via some space whales.
The organisers and Fifa have talked a lot about inclusivity  of the right kind of course  which was embodied in a sequence where Morgan Freeman and Ghanim al-Muftah spoke about overcoming differences. Al-Muftah is a Qatari who was born with Caudal Regression Syndrome which prevents the development of the lower spine, and he is a local social media personality.
In a sequence where dancers seemed to be dressed as Imperial troops from Star Wars holding light sabres, drummers and singers ran through a greatest hits of football chants, and then every now and then the camera would switch to the crowd where, handily, it turned out that groups of fans from competing nations beyond Qatar and Ecuador were all seated together wearing their replica shirts to cheer along.
There were also giant walking replica shirts that looked like they had escaped from a vintage edition of Jeux sans frontières.

The Qatari organisers rolled back the years with the mascots of World Cups gone by, marking a welcome reappearance of the likes of Naranjito from Spain 1982 and Footix from France 1998. Perhaps less welcome was the appearance of Zabivaka, Russias mascot from the last tournament. Russia were expelled from World Cup qualifying following their invasion of Ukraine in February of this year.
The parade of old mascots marked the entrance of the 2022 World Cup mascot. Laeeb is meant to be based on a ghutra headdress, but more than one observer has noted that it looks like the risen spirit of the migrant workers who have died in the course of putting this tournament on.
A surefire way to get an army of social media support for your opening ceremony is to include a K-Pop star, and Jungkook from BTS was on hand to sign his song Dreamers from the FIFA World Cup official soundtrack, a concept which would surely baffle Jules Rimet, founder of the whole World Cup caboodle back in the 1920s. After a long national debate, the seven members of BTS, one of the best-selling bands in the world, will shortly be putting their pop careers on pause to do military service in South Korea.

Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani was a popular figure with the crowd when he appeared, and he smiled broadly after there was a video montage sequence which showed him playing football as a young boy in the 1970s or 1980s.
Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar. Earlier this month, former Qatar international footballer and World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman said that homosexuality was damage in the mind.
Nevertheless al-Thani said the event gathered people of all nationalities and beliefs. From Qatar, from the Arab world, I welcome everyone to the World Cup 2022. How lovely it is that people can put aside what divides them to celebrate their diversity and what brings them together all at once.
After Saturdays bizarre nearly hour-long press conference where Infantino declared he felt gay, disabled and like a migrant worker, he had a much simpler message to deliver during the ceremony itself. Silence. He sat next to the Emir, but said nothing.
However, in an unusual move, long after the ceremony itself had finished, as Qatar and Ecuador assembled on the pitch, Fifas president  unscheduled - took the microphone to say: football unites the world. And now lets welcome the teams and let the show begin. All the best to everyone."

The modest 21,000-seat bowl in Al Rayyan  the Americans training headquarters for the length of their stay in Qatar  is eight miles from the soaring glass-and-steel skyscrapers and sprawling air-conditioned malls of the Doha corniche. But not nearly far enough, it turns out, to escape the swirling controversies about the first World Cup to be staged in an Arab country, which were only amplified to a deafening pitch in the run-up to Sundays opening match between the host country and Ecuador.
Among the most alarming concerns have been the countrys dismal human rights record with respect to migrant laborers, women and the LGBTQ community, the environmental costs of hosting the tournament in the region as well as the persistent allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and Fifa executives. Lately, the unfinished fan villages where traveling supporters have booked accommodation have evoked grim comparisons to Fyre Festival and only added to the criticisms over Qatars suitability as a host, a mountain that has accumulated since the oil-rich Gulf country was controversially awarded the tournament in 2010.
A few hours earlier, Fifa president Gianni Infantino hit back on the criticism surrounding the tournament in a sensational diatribe in which he accused the tournaments Western detractors of hypocrisy  dutifully hitting the Qatari governments talking points  while defending the countrys migrant workers policy and a last-minute decision to ban the sale of beer at World Cup stadiums (those in luxury executive boxes will still be able to drink whatever they want).
But even as the global reaction to Infantinos extraordinary hour-long broadside reverberated, the Americans went about their final preparations for Mondays opener against Wales at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium with a business-like focus.
We know that were a strong team and inside of our bubble, we try not to let anything inside, US center-back Aaron Long said. So just limiting distractions from the outside as much as we can and focusing on ourselves and focusing on this first game against Wales.
The Americans have not turned a blind eye to the human rights issues at play. On Tuesday, the team welcomed 20 migrant workers into the camp for a kickabout, a gesture that may bring attention to the more than 6,500 laborers from south Asia estimated to have died in the dozen years since Qatar won hosting rights. Additionally, US Soccer has introduced a rainbow-themed crest as a show of solidarity in a country where homosexuality is criminalized. The US team will use the logo in venues it controls, such as its Al-Gharafa training hub, the team hotel, media areas and fan parties the night before matches  though notably not during the matches themselves.
But with the end of the USs eight-year World Cup absence only 48 hours away, the attention on Saturday night was turned to the task at hand.
The United States, the second-youngest team in the tournament after Ghana, are led by whats been touted as a golden generation of rising talent. More than half of the 26-man squad compete in the worlds top five leagues, including feature players Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Weston McKennie (Juventus), Sergino Dest (Milan) and Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund).
But a closer inspection brings about more questions than answers. The backline has been ravaged by injury in recent months  established regulars Miles Robinson (achilles tendon) and Chris Richards (hamstring) both were left home  leaving Walker Zimmerman without an obvious partner at center-back. Left-back Antonee Robinson has said he is still trying to get used to playing on one ankle after a September injury with Fulham. Dest, the projected starter at right-back, was frozen out after a promising start at Barcelona and is far from his top form after struggling to get consistent minutes at Milan.
Theres also the glaring lack of goals from the No 9 position. In the end Jesus Ferreira, Josh Sargent and Haji Wright edged out Jordan Pefok and Ricardo Pepi, but none of them has managed to establish himself as a reliable central striker during Berhalters tenure. Ferreira, the likely starter against Wales, scores in bunches for FC Dallas but far less so for country: four of his seven international goals came in a Concacaf Nations League rout of Grenada this summer.

It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
That goal-scoring anxiety is only compounded by the teams punchless form of late, particularly against stiffer opposition. They have failed to score in six of their most recent seven games against countries who qualified for the World Cup, including an uninspired pair of friendlies against Saudi Arabia and Japan in their final tune-ups. Their biggest struggles have come against well-organized defensive teams who sit back and dare the Americans to break them down while looking for opportunities in transition  a bill that Wales fits uncomfortably well.
But Berhalter, who appointed defensive midfielder Tyler Adams as the teams captain on Sunday afternoon, has continued to exude a firm confidence around his young guns, all but one who are poised to make their World Cup debuts.
What I do believe is that on our best day we can beat anyone in the world. Anyone, he said this week. It is a great honor to play in the World Cup, but we dont want to just be participants. We want to perform. We think the first step is getting out of the group. And the second step is, in the knockout games, playing our best possible game and seeing how far we can go."

World Cup. The city that awaits them is one that has been transformed in the 12 years since the small Gulf state won its bid to host one of the biggest sporting events in the world.
The stadiums, hotels, apartment blocks and tourist attractions built in preparation for the tournament have reshaped the citys landscape forever.
They are also the legacy of the sweat and toil of the migrant worker army recruited from some of the poorest countries around the globe who worked long hours in sweltering conditions to build Qatars World Cup dream.
As the first whistle is set to blow, we have created an alternative tourist guide to the glittering landmarks that will provide the backdrop to the tournament, based on over a decade of reporting on migrant worker rights and the exploitation, debt and squalor that so many World Cup workers told us defined their working lives.
Start your day with a brisk walk along the Corniche, the promenade which skirts the bay in the heart of Doha. Count down the last hours until the tournament kicks off by the giant red clock in the shape of the World Cup logo, or take selfies in front of banners and displays with slogans like: fabulous, connect, amazing, now is all.
Here, you will meet people who have come to enjoy the tournament from all over the world. The only people you will not see are the men from India and Nepal who laboured in the ferocious summer heat to revamp the Corniche in time for your arrival.
Most of them were sent home long ago. In July, they told the Guardian they had been forced to pay huge and illegal recruitment fees to agents in their own countries in return for what they believed to be two-year contracts. Yet, in the rush to wrap up construction before the World Cup, many were sent home far earlier, leaving them fearing they would be left jobless, unable to support their families and deep in debt.
Everyone will be sent back because of the World Cup. It doesnt matter how long you have been here, said one. What can I do? Im helpless.
In a statement, a Qatari official said there was no government requirement for companies to repatriate employees or reduce their workforce before the World Cup.
From the Corniche, head through the glistening towers of West Bay and north to where some of Qatars most luxurious hotels look out over the exclusive stretch of coastline.
Inside, you will find cavernous marble-lined lobbies and opulent suites. If youre lucky enough to stay in one, you may find there is even a TV installed in the bathroom, so you can watch the football from the comfort of your bathtub.
A single night in a standard room at most of these hotels is more than many of the staff earn in a month. Last year, a Guardian investigation found scores of hotel workers earning a basic wage of £1.25 an hour or less. Some sub-contracted security guards, were working 12-hour shifts without a day off for months. Many staff said they were unable to change jobs because their employer refused to let them leave.
Weve fallen into a trap and cant get out, said one.
In response, Qatari official said the country had a zero-tolerance approach towards violating companies, issuing harsh penalties that included fines and prison sentences.
If youre an England fan, and you want to see where the team hotel is located, its on the coast in Al Wakrah. You wont get in but you can enjoy the souk and nearby beachfront. Stop by the restaurants to enjoy a plate of fresh fish or take a camel ride along the beach.
As you do, spare a thought for the security guards patrolling the area. In July, they told the Guardian they endured 12-hour shifts, for 30 days a month. If I take a day off, they cut my salary, said one. They find themselves in a bind. They know they are being exploited, but even the meagre wage they earn here is more than they can make back home, and so they are reluctant to complain.
A Kenyan explained that his salary was far lower than he was promised when he left home. You are told one thing in Kenya and another in Qatar, he said. Theres nothing you can do. Just keep quiet and get on with it.
If you want a break from football, drop in to the National Museum. On the outside, its made up of mind-bending interlocking discs, designed to look like a desert rose.
Some of the men who worked on the inside told the Guardian in 2016 they were earning a much lower salary than they had been promised when they were recruited in Nepal; a basic wage of around £135 a month. If I had known I would [get so little], I definitely wouldnt have come, said one.
When the Guardian visited their labour camp in a rundown compound outside Doha, it found eight men sharing one room. With no lockers, their clothes were hung on lines across the wall and personal belongings stashed under their bunk beds.
To end the day, why not head to Souq Waqif? Its a popular spot for people from around the world who come to shop in its bazaar or have a bite to eat. But when the Guardian visited in 2016, one group of visitors did not appear to be welcome. Whenever the police spotted young south Asian men, they were quickly intercepted and directed to the exit.
That practice has now ended, but low-wage workers in Qatar continue to live in starkly different conditions to what visitors will experience.
The Qatari authorities have taken some steps to improve their living and working conditions, including introducing a minimum wage, partially dismantling the abusive kafala system and improving some worker accommodation, but for most of the men you have met on this alternative tour, it is either too little, or too late.
If you head to the north of Doha you will enter Lusail City, a new district full of outrageous towers, like the crescent-shaped building formed of two giant curved arms reaching skywards. They host two hotels; one has five stars, the other six.
Theres another hotel in Lusail that holds a darker secret. It was built in 2014 by North Korean workers under conditions likely to constitute forced labour. They worked so hard and for so long, the site manager built a room for them so they could take a quick rest without having to return to their labour camp. Despite this, it is likely that they only kept about 10% of their earnings, while the rest was expropriated by the North Korean regime.
We are here to earn foreign currency for our nation, one said. The site manager said, They dont have a single rial themselves. They borrow money from us if they need small things like cigarettes.
Al Bayt stadium
Drive out of Lusail and up the five-lane highway to the stunning Al Bayt stadium, which will host the opening game of the World Cup. If England reach the semi-finals, they are likely to play four games here.
The stadium is built to resemble a nomadic tent. If you need refreshments, pop into the on-site McDonalds, also decked out like a tent. Take a walk around the lush grounds that surround the stadium, brush your hand over the immaculate grass of the training pitches and enjoy the cool breeze coming off the small lake.
Then consider the men who maintain this welcoming green space. In the summer, the Guardian found them living on the edge of the desert, with up to six men crammed into tiny, windowless cabins.
They said they had been forced to pay illegal fees to secure their jobs and many were still in debt months later, which they were struggling to pay off because their basic salary worked out at just £1 an hour.
Despite a new law giving workers the right to freely change jobs, the gardeners at Al Bayt and two other stadiums said they were unable to switch employment. If we could change jobs, everyone would leave! said one.
The local World Cup organising committee started a programme in 2017 to reimburse stadium workers who had paid recruitment fees. About £20 million has been repaid so far. The Al Bayt gardeners had not received any repayments at the time the Guardian met them. Following the Guardians revelations, the men were moved to better accommodation.
Education City stadium
Now head back south to Doha and visit the Education City stadium. Its been called the diamond in the desert on account of its shiny, angled surface.
The construction of stadiums and other World Cup-related infrastructure has created hundreds of thousands of jobs for workers from some of the poorest countries in the region. Some have positive stories to tell; of earning a decent regular wage, which they sent home to pay for a new house or their childrens education. But for a few, their story has a very different ending.
In June 2019, a young Nepali man named Rupchandra Rumba, who worked as a scaffolder at the stadium, woke up gasping for breath in a squalid labour camp nearby. His friends called for help, but it was too late and he died shortly afterwards.
Back in Nepal, his wife, Nirmala Pakrin, has spent the last three and a half years wondering why she has never received compensation from his employer. She cant understand how a country with so much money will not help pay for her sons education.
Al Janoub stadium
Keep heading south and you will come to another futuristic arena, resembling a giant white spaceship. Its called Al Janoub stadium.
Eight years ago, labourers preparing the ground for the stadium told the Guardian they were being paid as little as 45p an hour. They said their passports were held by their manager.
In 2018, another young Nepali, Tej Narayan Tharu was carrying loads high up in the stadium, when he fell to his death through a gap in the walkway.
In Nepal, his wife, Renuka Chaudhary, was left confused and concerned about the future of their four year-old daughter. Im so worried. I have no one to earn money for the family now. How can I pay for her education and raise her? she said.
Sita, Tharus mother, said: Im heartbroken. My son has gone for ever. Hes never coming back. He has a small daughter. Life is long and hard. How will she survive?
Chaudhary later received compensation for her husbands death."

World Cup ever? Mohammad al-Kuwari dismisses 12 years of international cynicism and scrutiny with a shrug.
We dont care that much, the Qatari national says from his office among the luminescent skyscrapers of Dohas palm-lined West Bay waterfront. They say if you dont have enemies youre not successful. Every successful person has people jealous of them.
With hours until arguably the worlds biggest sporting event kicks off, Qatar is witnessing a spree of grand openings: new roads, restaurants, stadiums and theme parks, in addition to a brand new city, Lusail, erected in time to host the World Cup final. We used to have malls, but now we have many malls, even malls I havent been to yet, says Mohammad al-Qassabi, 22, a recent university graduate.
More than a dozen interviews with Qataris over the past week have shed light on a society eager to welcome the world (Theyll see were actually very nice people, al-Kuwari says) but a little anxious at its presence, counselling their children in the unfamiliar things they are about to see and hear.
With my kids, for example, Im telling them: soon we will be seeing the people we always see outside of Qatar, inside of Qatar, says Reem al-Bader, who works in healthcare. We will be going to matches, maybe some people will be sitting next to you. If you see them doing any weird actions, just ignore. Dont shout at them, dont disrespect anyone  theyre our guests.
Above all, though, Qataris say they are enraged at how one of the most important moments in their countrys 51-year history is being portrayed by some western governments and the media.
It hurts me, says Shaikha al-Marri, a graphic designer living in Doha. And what hurts me the most is, its coming from  what do they call themselves? Developed countries. Countries that lecture the world about tolerance, about peace.
The things the west is allowed to do, were not allowed to do, says a businessman in the gas industry, who asked not to be named. Were not allowed to be richer than them, were not allowed to be smarter than them, were not allowed to be more advanced. It is a way of staying ahead in the game.
It is no longer about Qataris, says Noora Fakhroo, who works in telecommunications. If we fail, the Arab world will fail, and if we succeed its a success story for everyone. The equation is like that now, especially with the attacks we are receiving.
Qatar wanted the worlds gaze. Instead, it has received its glare, in the form of critical media coverage of its conservative social laws, substandard conditions for low-wage workers and the circumstances surrounding its successful World Cup bid. But while the scrutiny of foreign governments and the media stings, increased visibility is precisely why Qatar wanted the tournament.
The peninsula state has the second-largest proven natural gas reserves in the world, but those who see only its fabulous wealth can miss the countrys deep sense of insecurity. Its citizens number fewer than 350,000, a fraction of the countrys nearest neighbour, Saudi Arabia, which has long considered Qatar either rightfully part of its own territory, or a vassal state that should toe the Saudi line, says Paul Michael Brannagan, an international relations scholar who has co-authored a book on the 2022 World Cup.
This threat is neither abstract, nor past: as recently as 2017, Riyadh led an effort by allied Gulf states to freeze out Qatar, brand it a supporter of terrorism and blockade its airspace and ports, offering relief only if Doha agreed to a set of demands that amounted to surrendering its independence.
Qatar outlasted the campaign thanks to a decades-long strategy of building energy and security ties with larger countries, including the UK  which broke from the Trump administration to call for an end to the blockade  and by carefully raising its profile in the world as an international destination for ending wars, seeing art and watching sport.
For small states like Qatar, their greatest hurdle is invisibility and survival, and they tend to be linked, Brannagan says. The World Cup is really about, first and foremost, showcasing Qatars sovereign independence and separating itself symbolically from Saudi Arabia.
Long-term, it doesnt matter if the world has a negative perspective of Qatar now. Behind the scenes, this event is going to do so many things for the country that it couldnt have done without it.
Embracing the world has bought Qatar some security, but it has also transformed its close-knit society at whiplash speed. When I was young, the community was very small, everyone knew each other, says Mubaraka al-Marri, 54, a businesswoman and social activist. Life was very quiet.
Qatari women are subject to guardianship laws that give men control over who they marry, if they can work or study and whether they can leave the country. But many women are also eager to point out their rate of participation in the workforce has become the highest in the region, and that they now graduate from Qatars best universities at far higher rates than men.
We did have tribal aspects that affected how women were treated, affected her rights, says Fakhroo. [But] when you walk into any workplace right now youll see the majority are women who are working, and theyre part of management. Theyre part of ministries and theyre successful.
For every opening, there has been pushback. People arent afraid of change, theyre afraid about their identity, says Mubaraka al-Marri. We have values, we have traditions.
She points to art exhibits in Doha that have sparked some outcry, including a recent show featuring the flamboyantly dressed British artist Daniel Lismore (Why do we bring these strange people?) and fears among some that the widespread adoption of English is diluting the quality of young peoples Arabic.
We have to be careful about what is coming into our society, she says. Not to accept everything because others accept it, especially just because westerners accept it  Why do they want us to be a copy of them?
The World Cup has been a catalyst for faster, deeper changes, including to the countrys notorious labour sector  too late for the at least 6,500 south Asian migrant workers estimated to have died in the country over the past decade.
For many Qataris, the workers issue is hazy and contested. Several pointed to Fifas official count that just three people perished on construction sites for World Cup stadiums. Ill be honest with you, I dont know if there was a lot of deaths or injuries, says Aisha a-Maadeed, 28, an environmental activist. Because you dont believe anything on social media or on the media or in the news.
Under the supervision of the International Labour Organization, Qatar has made steps towards improving the system  with significant room for progress  despite the grumblings the reforms have sparked.
Things have changed a lot in the last 15 years and any worker now has the freedom to change jobs, says al-Kuwari. Its changed to the point where it feels like the opposite [] Imagine, you bring someone whos working for you, and you teach him and make him learn the job, he says. Before, if he wanted to switch jobs he needed a no-objection letter. Now, he can leave you and go. And people are like, Fine. Its no problem.
The prospect of gay and queer people being permitted to openly participate in festivities over the next month has been a harder sell, sparking consternation and homophobia within Qatars raucous social media circles. Influencers have been among those trying to calm the public mood.
For a long time, [gay people] have been in our country, Mohammed al-Dosari, a popular Qatari personality, says in one video responding to the discontent. Theyre already here. Both boys and girls. Does it change anything? Focus instead on looking after yourself, the people around you, your family, and trying to make sure this kind of thing doesnt reach them.
Think about how you can change the ones who are coming, he adds. That they see our traditions and how we live and maybe something will change in them. But if you carry on this way, nothing will change, in them or in you. The opposite: youll make them hate you, hate the religion and hate the country. Try to change them [by your example], and if you cant change them, shut up.
Qataris travel widely, but the prospect of encountering rowdy fan behaviour and public drunkenness at home  where it is harshly policed, but will be tolerated to some extent for the course of the tournament  is another bracing thought .
I am concerned, but Im also expecting it, says Fakhroo. Im telling myself, Noora, stay realistic. This is happening  My only concern is that my kids are attending some of the games, and making them aware that some of these things might happen in front of them  for them not to be shocked.
The tournament has prompted careful conversations with her football-mad eldest son, aged nine, she adds. Hes seen it online and weve spoken about it. He knows whats acceptable and not in our religion. Hes aware of people being drunk and stuff like that. Hes also aware of the LGBTQ community and how we dont get affected by them, and so on.
For others, the arrival of the worlds fans will mean more practical adaptations. Before the World Cup, we could easily leave our cars open and go to the store and come back, says al-Qassabi. Or leave our laptops in a food court or restaurant and go and come back, or leave our front doors open.
But during the World Cup we expect people from different backgrounds, different behaviours. So, we have to be more safe.
Most say they are at ease with what is about to erupt in their city, reassured by a belief it is ultimately temporary. Its like when you have a party, says Mubaraka al-Marri. Your house isnt used in the way you know, because there are people inside. But when they leave, you organise it again as you like.
Shaikha, her daughter, agrees: January 2023, I think the rules will be back, maybe even more strictly when it comes to drinking. And I know my European friends, theyre used to drinking in designated areas  and they are OK with that.
But unwinding the transformations of the next four weeks may not be so simple. Beer tents can be packed up and bans on public displays of affection reimposed. But for those pushing for a more relaxed kingdom, the memory of what is transpiring here may not be so easily erased.
They hired David Beckham to be the face of the Fifa World Cup, says al-Maadeed. So, after the World Cup, if a Qatari guy comes and shows his tattoos, no one can speak. And if a Qatari lady comes with her tattoos showing, no one should speak because, two or three months before, you were advertising this guy whose tattoos are virtually everywhere."

While the official number of worker deaths during preparations for the tournament has been put at three, according to the Qataris and the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, that figure has been disputed by human rights organisations. It has been reported that the real number of worker deaths linked to World Cup projects in Qatar will never be known.

The issue over human rights has cast a shadow over the tournament and Dier, who pointed out that the decision to award the World Cup to Qatar had nothing to do with the players and coaches, has felt compelled to learn more about the situation in the host country.
Its very difficult for players, the England centre-back said. We come here and know these topics are going to be addressed. I was looking today because I thought I would probably get this kind of question.
The World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010. I was 16 at the time. We have absolutely no say in where we play. Those decisions are made by people way above us and were the ones who end up answering these kind of questions. Its disappointing. I carry the values Ive been given by my family. At the same time I respect wherever I go.

Weve been here a very short time so for me its important to live this experience and have a much better idea of what to say on it. A lot of things have already happened  a lot of things are very disappointing. Those will always be in my mind. But as a team we carry certain values and no matter where we go well carry those values. At the same time well respect everywhere we go.
Dier, who is a contender to start when England face Iran in their opening game in Group B on Monday, was asked what he found disappointing. Im talking about the buildings of the stadiums, he replied. Its a terrible situation. Things have happened in the past, but as players we have no influence on these decisions. Its a World Cup and Im extremely proud to be a part of a team. Were extremely proud to be here to represent our country. We are footballers  not politicians.
The controversies have muted Diers excitement. Were talking about it instead of talking about football, so of course its taking a lot of that away, he said. But we cant hide from it. It would be wrong to ignore it.
Englands players will discuss whether to take the knee before kicking off against Iran. The squad has always looked to speak out on societal issues and Dier was in a thoughtful mood as he addressed the media. The Tottenham defender was even asked if he could see himself becoming involved in football administration after he retires.
I am 28, he said. I have a long time to play. I am very interested. I have this conversation a lot with friends within football about the future. I am definitely interested in staying in football. It is my passion. I am not really into politics too much. I dont know if I have the right thing for it. It is really important that football is in the right hands and looked after in the right way because it means so much to so many people."

The squad finally arrived home last weekend before the big kick-off, stepping off the plane at Doha airport knowing that more than a decade of waiting and working was about to end. Should Sundays Group A opener against Ecuador not go well, however, the nightmare of following South Africa into the unwanted record books as a host that fell at the group stage will be very real. Senegal and the Netherlands come next.
Bafana Bafanas 2010 failure was lamented but for many watching around the world, the usual hope that the host nation does well will not apply for Qatar. Its also fairly certain that most are unaware of their prospects given Qatar have no history at the World Cup. But even those who have watched the team for years are curious to see how it all turns out, not least Félix Sánchez.
The Spanish coach started work at Dohas Aspire Academy back in 2006 and, along with a number of players, moved up through the age ranks and was promoted to take charge of the senior side in 2017. Evidence that the former Barcelona academy coach has been successful is the simple fact that the 46-year-old is still in command. Many felt that two or so years out from 2022, the groundwork would have been laid for a big-name foreign coach such as Pep Guardiola, who played in the country and was an ambassador for the bid back in 2010. It has not been discussed in Doha.

In 2019, Qatar, who had never made a splash at the Asian Cup, won the tournament in emphatic fashion, cruising to the title in a hostile atmosphere in the neighbouring United Arab Emirates at a time of the Qatar blockade. Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Lebanon, Iraq, South Korea and hosts the UAE were all defeated before a 3-1 victory over Japan in the final. It was a dominant performance with 19 goals scored and one conceded. The two attacking stars were Almoez Ali, who scored a record-breaking nine goals, and Akram Afif who contributed 10 assists. Midfielders Hassan al-Haydos and Abdulaziz Hatem made the official team of the tournament as did the defenders Abdelkarim Hassan, Bassam al-Rawi and Boualem Khoukhi.
Since then, Qatar  50th in Fifas world rankings  have been on tour, playing in the 2019 Copa América where they earned a 2-2 draw with Paraguay and suffered narrow defeats against Colombia and Argentina. At the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup, Qatar won their group and reached the semi-finals only to be knocked out by the USA 1-0. Ali ended up as top scorer in yet another continental championship. Many were impressed by a team that looked smooth as a 3-5-2 or 5-3-2 and liked to attack more than defend.
As well as all the travels that included 10 European friendlies, the national team  who all play at home  have been training together since June, mainly in Spain. We have had a good preparation programme, taking into account that we are Qatar, a small country with little experience, said Sánchez.

The big question, of course, is will it be enough against Ecuador, a game that the country has waited for since 2010? Perhaps it would have been better to play the Netherlands in the opener, get all the razzmatazz out of the way and then focus on the next two matches which, on paper at least, are more winnable games.
We already know that there is that pressure, and we dont have to add to it, said Sánchez. We try to isolate ourselves from the noise around us and focus on getting our best performance. Its difficult because then you go on to the pitch, you see 60,000 people. Its the first World Cup match and theres so much expectation that its hard, but that experience will help them.

There is concern that Qatar have passed their peak. Performances this year have been mixed. This is a side that would have loved to have hosted the World Cup not just last summer but two or three winters ago. No fewer than 15 of the squad and most of the starting 11 were at the Asian Cup almost four years ago. Eighteen of Sánchezs players came through the Aspire Academy. He has introduced little new blood and the team are heavily reliant on the attacking pair of Ali and Afif.
What may change is the tactical approach with Qatar sitting back on home soil. It would be suicide to try to take the initiative if we want to be competitive, said Sánchez. We try to be compact defensively, allow the minimum opportunities and be strong in transitions.
For Qatar, it is a case of whatever works after the longest pre-World Cup preparation period in history."

During your stay you in Qatar, you are likely to interact with more nationalities than there are teams in the World Cup. That begins the moment you step off the plane.
As you walk through Dohas immaculate Hamad International airport almost everyone you meet  from cleaners in the toilets and security guards on patrol, to helpers guiding you through immigration  will be a migrant worker, as 95% of Qatars working population is from overseas.
Step outside and grab a taxi to your hotel, and you may meet someone like Saeed from Pakistan. Just be sure that he is alert.
Im so tired. I work 15, 16, 18 hours a day. What to do? We need to make money, so we have to work, he says.
He earns between 100 and 300 rials (£23-£70) a day, but that gets whittled away by the fee he has to pay to rent the car, along with petrol, insurance and the annual cost of his visa. Much of what he earns is sent home to his wife and three young children, who he has not seen for almost two years. I came here to support my family. If I dont send them money, they dont eat, he says. I miss them so much, but Im happy because I can help them.
Saeed is hopeful business will pick up during the World Cup. Its good for everyone. People are coming from lots of countries, he says.
As Saeed drops you at your hotel, you may not notice the security guard standing discreetly at the entrance, but if you come out to explore 12 hours later, John may still be there. Such long shifts are not unusual in hotels here, especially among sub-contracted security companies, like the one he works for.
In Uganda the income is not good so I decided to come to Qatar to look for the green pasture, says John. He is yet to find it.
Like the vast majority of low-wage workers in Qatar, John had to pay an agent in his own country for his job. It cost him about £1,125, which he paid for with a loan that came with a 10% interest rate. He used the land his family live on as security for the loan.
You work for the debt, the debt does not go, the debt is growing  remember the whole family is on your land; what if they take the land?
John says he earns about 1,700 rials a month including overtime pay. If you compare the work and the money, it is not enough. I feel bad, but theres nothing to do. You must work if you are looking for greener pastures.
Shafiq is also a security guard at one of Dohas top hotels, but he has had a different experience. Unlike John, he was recruited from Bangladesh directly by the hotel, at no cost. He works long hours but they are within the legal limit, and he knows it. Our hotel teaches us about our rights, he says.
He pulls out his phone and proudly shows a photo of his twin sons, born a couple of months ago. Asked if he has been home to see them, he shakes his head, eyes brimming with tears, My mother suffered a stroke recently and so I need to stay here to earn enough money for her treatment, he says.
With thousands of fans put up in apartments, and even modified shipping containers, demand for food delivery services will soar, which should come as good news for Abbas, who is from Pakistan.
Before the World Cup, he was lucky to earn 60 rials in a 14-hour day. Much of that time was spent waiting for orders.
The company he works for is not his employer. Instead, he is hired by what is called a supply company and sent out to work for the delivery firm. As such, hes the last to get an order, and is usually dispatched to the most remote locations.
Supply companies have brought a lot of workers over for the World Cup. There are too many riders and not enough orders, says Abbas. Two of my friends have already gone back. Ill only stay if I can get a better job.
If you would prefer to head out for a meal, Dohas metro system will get you there. It is clean, efficient and staffed by polite, eager people. They are clearly proud of their role, but also a little nervous.
The only thing you can do is stay sane and stay alive! The Arab Cup [held a year ago] was crazy, a lot of noise and people falling over. The World Cup will be even more, says Gloria from the Philippines.
Throughout the World Cup, regular staff like Gloria will be supported by thousands of volunteers, like Mohan. They have been hired for three months, just for the World Cup, and are paid a small salary. Mohan, who is from India, is happy with the deal because he hopes to stay on afterwards. My main intention is to get a permanent job over here, he says, admitting he is job hunting on his days off.
It will be challenging to manage the crowd. I like these challenges and Im eager to work in this World Cup, he says. Asked if he likes football, he says, I play football but I like cricket the most. Only in Qatar would footballs global showcase be delivered with the help of an army of cricket lovers.
There is one group of workers you may not see much of: the low-wage construction labourers who built the airport you arrived at, the roads you drive along and the hotel you stay in. Much construction has been put on hold for six months due to the World Cup and thousands of workers, like Baburam, have been sent home.
Back in Nepal, he says he is now in a worse condition than when he left for Qatar because he was sent back before he was able to repay his recruitment debt. The workers are not getting any benefits. They are being sent home because of the World Cup, says Baburam. Our familys situation was already bad and now its even worse. Whatever we had before weve lost.

announcement in 2010 that the tiny but enormously wealthy Gulf state of Qatar would host the Fifa 2022 Football World Cup, the Nepal-based Guardian journalist Pete Pattisson made the first of many trips to Kathmandus airport in Nepal to count coffins.
For months, Pattisson traced the bodies of dozens of migrant workers repatriated from Qatar back to their families to try to establish why they never made it home alive. It was the start of 10 years of reporting by the Guardian into the sometimes brutal conditions faced by hundreds of thousands of migrant workers tasked with building Qatars state-of-the-art stadiums, and the roads, hotels and infrastructure needed to host one of the biggest sporting events on Earth.
With just days to go to first kick-off, we look back at how migrant rights became centre stage in arguably the most controversial World Cup in the history of the tournament.
The Guardian publishes a comprehensive investigation into worker deaths and abuse in Qatar, which finds that dozens of workers had died and others were suffering appalling labour abuses, which in some case could amount to forced labour, a form of modern slavery, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Workers were being forced to live in unsanitary and overcrowded accommodation and some said that they were not being paid and were unable to leave and return home. In response, the Qatari labour ministry says it has strict rules governing working in the heat, the provision of labour and the prompt payment of salaries. The Supreme Committee, the body tasked with organising the World Cup, told the Guardian it was deeply concerned with the allegations and had been told the government authorities were conducting an investigation
The Guardian reports that Qatar is facing growing international pressure to act against the rising death toll of migrant workers preparing for the 2022 World Cup, as unions warned another 4,000 people could die in the Gulf emirate before a ball is kicked. Fifa calls for an urgent enquiry and says very concerned about the reports presented by the media regarding labour rights abuses and the conditions for construction workers. A spokesman for Qatars World Cup organisers says they are appalled by the Guardian revelations and there is no excuse for the maltreatment of workers.
After the Guardians 2013 investigation, Qatari officials commit to sweeping labour reforms, including replacing the countrys kafala sponsorship system, which tethers workers to a single employer and prevents them from leaving their job or the country without permission.
As construction on the World Cup stadiums begins, the Guardian returns to the Qatar capital, Doha, and reports that workers assigned to build the Aspire football complex  housing the headquarters of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy  claim they were not paid for months. In response to the allegations, Qatars 2022 World Cup organising committee says it is heavily dismayed to hear of the allegations and will continue to press for a speedy and fair conclusion to all cases.
A follow-up investigation finds that migrant workers building the first stadium for Qatars 2022 World Cup say they had been earning as little as 45p an hour. The pay rate appeared to be in breach of the tournament organisers own worker welfare rules and despite the Gulf kingdom spending £134bn on infrastructure in the lead-up to the competition.
The Guardian finds North Korean labourers working on large construction projects in conditions that may amount to forced labour. The investigation suggests the workers may receive as little as 10% of their salary during the three years they typically work in Qatar, with the remainder expropriated by a chain of North Korean state-run bodies, overseen by Office 39, a department that reportedly controls a fund to bankroll Kim Jong-uns lifestyle. The Qatari authorities say that there are 2,800 North Korean guest workers registered in Qatar and they have no recorded complaints about their payment or treatment. Qatar is determined to continually improve labour conditions for all who work in the country, and will continue to work with NGOs, businesses and other governments to achieve this, it says in a statement.
The Guardian reveals claims of labour abuses among subsidiaries of leading British construction firms. Alleged abuses include erratic or reduced payment of wages, passport confiscation, workers entering employment with high levels of debt bondage and pay levels below those agreed when workers were recruited in their home countries. The workers spoke of a culture of fear and intimidation, with threats of arrest or deportation. Both companies say they are working within the parameters of Qatari law and rigorously monitor their labour supply companies to ensure good practice.
The Guardian finds World Cup stadium workers being paid £5 a day  a £650 a month basic salary for eight hours of work a day, six days a week. The investigation also uncovered the plight of those who say they had paid agents for visas, but whose jobs and sponsors proved to be a mirage. The supreme committee says its contractors had been instructed to pay the advisory minimum wage and after an investigation, any problems with payment had been rectified.
Despite bid committee chief executive Hassan Al-Thawadi saying in 2010 that heat is not and will not be an issue, the Guardian reveals that hundreds of thousands of migrant workers toiled in temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours a day, potentially leading to the deaths of hundreds of workers. An analysis of weather conditions finds that it is unsafe to work outside at all in Qatar. A government spokesperson acknowledges that heat stress was challenging but says the government has introduced legislation to protect workers, as well as new national heat stress guidance.
The human rights organisation says the majority of migrant worker deaths in Qatar are attributed to natural causes, cardiac or respiratory failure; classifications which are meaningless without the underlying cause of death explained, according to one expert cited. Amnesty says intense heat and humidity exposure is likely to be a significant factor and has urged the Qatari authorities to put in place better protections for workers. A government spokesperson says: Qatar remains steadfast in its commitment to labour reform and will not be thrown off course by any organisation that seeks to discredit the progress we have made.
Qatar finally launches sweeping reforms to its labour laws, ending kafala and introducing a non-discriminatory minimum wage, the first in the Middle East. The reforms are widely lauded by the ILO and cautiously welcomed by human rights groups.
A multi-country investigation by the Guardian finds at least 6,500 workers from south Asia have died in Qatar in the 10 years since it was awarded the right to host the World Cup. The findings expose Qatars failure to protect its 2 million-strong migrant workforce, or even investigate the causes of the apparently high death rate among the largely young workers. The Qatar government says that the number of deaths  which it does not dispute  is proportionate to the size of the migrant workforce and that the figures include white-collar workers who have died naturally after living in Qatar for many years. It also says that only 20% of migrants from the countries in question are employed in construction, and that work-related deaths in this sector accounted for fewer than 10% of fatalities within this group.
A year before the first match is due to be played, the Guardian exposes allegations of abusive working conditions in hotels included in Fifas hospitality packages. A Qatari official said Qatar had a zero-tolerance approach towards violating companies, issuing harsh penalties that included fines and prison sentences.
We reveal how low-wage migrant workers have been forced to pay billions of dollars in recruitment fees to secure their jobs in World Cup host nation Qatar over the past decade. The Qatar government says companies involved in illegal recruitment practices have been severely punished and that 24 recruitment agencies were shut down and had their licences revoked for breaking Qatars laws.
The Guardian travels across the southern plains of Nepal to investigate how families of workers who died in Qatar are left in debt and without compensation after a failure to investigate deaths. A spokesperson for the Qatar government says that companies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident. The supreme committee organising the World Cup in Qatar says in a statement that its commitment to the, health, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast and unwavering.
With only months to go before the start of the tournament, the Guardians Pete Pattisson travels again to Qatar to report on how migrant workers say they are being ordered home before the World Cup starts, leaving them in debt and without work. In a statement, a Qatari official says there is no government requirement for companies to repatriate employees or reduce their workforce before the World Cup.
On the eve of the tournament, security guards at the heart of World Cup festivities claim they are paid just 35p an hour, appear to only get one day off a month and are housed in dirty camps on the edge of the desert. In response, the Qatari government says that extensive action has been taken to combat exploitative labour practices and when violations are recorded, corrective action is taken and offending companies penalised. The Al Nasr Star Group, which employs the security guards, confirms the guards work 12-hour shifts but say they get two hours break each day and one day off a week."

The Fan Leader Network is a scheme run by the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the Qatari agency responsible for the World Cup. It has recruited supporters from around the globe, offering travel and accommodation and a place at the World Cup opening ceremony in return for enthusiasm and positive social media content. But the Guardian can reveal that a per diem payment for food and drink, upon which some supporters were depending, was cancelled just as fans were packing to travel to the Gulf.
Members of the Fan Leader Network from two European countries said their payments had been cancelled three days ago and that authorities had blamed the decision on the bad press which followed the revelation that fans were being paid.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Fans were told in a message, seen by the Guardian: Due to the recent developments in the media, we are keen to protect our visiting fans from the erroneous misinformed statements regarding fans receiving payment for the trip. Accordingly, the daily allowance will unfortunately no longer be issued. The allowance was intended as a small uplift on your own personal funds to assist with refreshments during your stay.
Although the fans the Guardian spoke to said the loss of money had not deterred anyone from travelling, they were concerned about how they would pay for the rest of their stay. One fan said they had paid for maintenance for their car on the assumption that the per diem would be coming.
The email sent to members of the Network said: We requested from the outset that you brought sufficient funds to cover your own living expenses and we have committed to cover flights, accommodation and opening match tickets.
The news comes two days before the opening ceremony and follows an announcement by Fifa that it would no longer be possible to buy alcohol at World Cup stadiums. This was a decision widely understood to have been forced on footballs governing body at the last minute by Qatar.
Concerns will now rise that further commitments made by the organisers could yet be ignored too, including the safety of LGBTQ+ fans in a country where homosexuality is illegal.
According to the terms and conditions of the Fan Leader Network, initially revealed by the Dutch broadcaster NOS, travellers have been asked to promote the tournament and the experience as part of the trip. Key to the deal will be liking and re-sharing third-party posts, and fans have reportedly been asked to flag social media content critical of the event.

One of the fans spoken to by the Guardian understood this arrangement to be something easily achieved, simply by posting the kind of material they would have done anyway.
The executive director of Football Supporters Europe, Ronan Evain, said: Who would have thought that an authoritarian regime with an appalling workers rights record was not to be trusted? I suppose thats what you get for accepting to be paid the equivalent of a Qatari monthly minimum wage every four days for the pleasure of doing absolutely nothing.
Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy has been approached for comment."

brand?,"Wherever Fahad, a gay man in his 40s, walks in his home city of Doha, from the Qatari capitals coastal promenade, known as the Corniche, to the gleaming streets of the super-modern downtown Msheireb district, David Beckham smiles down from the billboards and the big flashing screens.
The former England captain, husband to the former Spice Girl Victoria, father to Brooklyn, Romeo, Harper and Cruz, is not just a face of the World Cup kicking off this Sunday, he is the pre-eminent figure  a 2022 version of the 1966 mascot World Cup Willie some might be tempted to say, if not something cruder.
Fahad tries to be understanding about the temptation posed by the £150m deal that Beckham is said to have been offered by Qatar, albeit the value of the contract is disputed. But the former footballers decision to accept the fortune from the royal house of Thani and take up the ambassadorial role is, to Fahads mind, a damnable pact worthy only of scorn.
I see that his future will be ruined but at least he will have some millions, said Fahad, who as a younger man spent two and a half months in solitary confinement in a Qatari prison for the crime of wearing makeup. No, nothing has changed for us.
Same-sex sexual activity is punishable by seven years in prison in Qatar. Under an interpretation of sharia law, it can lead to a death sentence. There is not so much an LGBTQ+ community in Qatar as a disparate collection of terrified individuals.
This summer, Beckham, 47, took part in a promotional film for Visit Qatar in which he spoke of the pride of Qataris about their culture. The modern and traditional fuse to create something really special, he said. It is his image flashing across Qatari World Cup Snapchat and Instagram channels. In a video message to a youth festival in Doha on Thursday he claimed the World Cup would be a platform for progress, inclusivity and tolerance. Two weeks ago, Beckham, donning dark sunglasses, posed alongside the British sculptor Hugo Dalton and his installation of golden goal posts on Dohas Lusail City Marina.
In a jarring contrast, Human Rights Watch reported just a few days before the sunny photoshoot on the suffering of gay and transgender people who said they had been detained as recently as October in an underground prison in Dohas Al Dafna district, six miles south of the golden posts, where they had been variously verbally abused, slapped, kicked and punched until they bled. One woman said she lost consciousness.
Beckhams friend and former teammate Gary Neville was recently on the rough end of an appearance on the news panel show Have I Got News for You over his World Cup contract with the state-owned broadcaster beIN Sports. Robbie Williams and Black Eyed Peas have come under fire for agreeing to perform.
But Beckham, contrary to the pet name Golden Balls given to him by his wife in the innocent days of 2008, when he could do no wrong, has been the central target of the opprobrium.
Back in 2002 Beckham posed for the cover of Attitude, the gay magazine, and subsequently made the undeniably pioneering statement in a game riddled with homophobia that he was honoured to have the tag of gay icon.
The distance Beckham has seemingly travelled in the last two decades might account for much of the vehemence of the backlash coming his way.
The relationship with Qatar, a country with which he has longstanding links from his time as a player at the French club, Paris Saint-Germain, owned by Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, now arguably presents the biggest risk to the Beckham brand since his talent and curtains haircut caught the public attention with an audacious halfway-line goal against Wimbledon in 1996 in the red of Manchester United.
Piara Powar, the director of Fare, an anti-discrimination group that has an arrangement with Fifa to post monitors in the World Cup stadiums in Qatar, said it had pleaded behind the scenes without success for the countrys supreme committee, in charge of the event, to make a public statement welcoming LGBTQ+ people to the football.
They were prepared to say some things off the record but not to do anything publicly, Powar said of conversations that had carried on up to October. Judgments would be made, he suggested, about Beckhams decision to maintain his link.
Some of the things that people like David Beckham are learning is that human rights are universal and non-negotiable, he said. I have no doubt that the LGBTI community in western Europe will see him as somehow a traitor or someone who used to be an ally but no longer is.
The comedian Joe Lycett said this week that he would put £10,000 of his own money into a shredder if Beckham did not end his deal with Qatar. Picking up his award for man of the year at the Attitude awards, the worlds only out top-tier footballer, Josh Cavallo, from Australia, told the audience: Take that, David Beckham, before appealing for him to speak out about LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar.
Beckham said this week: Qatar dreamed of bringing the World Cup to a place that it had never been before, but that it wouldnt be enough just to achieve things on the pitch. The pitch would be a platform for progress.
But Peter Tatchell, the human rights campaigner, who visited Qatar last month to stage a daring one day protest, could not be more withering.
Despite Qatar being a sexist, homophobic and racist dictatorship, hes reportedly described it as perfection, he said. Beckham was once a LGBT+ ally and icon but no more. Hes taken his 30 pieces of silver. Putting money before principles, he seems driven solely by pure greed.
But could this really be terminal for the Beckham brand?
Andy Milligan, the author of Brand It Like Beckham, a book chronicling the building of the image of the boy from Leytonstone, has his doubts.
Beckham had maintained his appeal across the demographics for over a quarter of century, he said, despite episodes that would have surely killed off other celebrity figures.
There was the alleged affair in 2004 with his personal assistant Rebecca Loos (denied by Beckham), the petulant red card in the 1998 World Cup tie with Argentina that some speculate cost England the tournament, and then, perhaps most dangerous of all, the leak of emails published by European newspapers, in spite of an injunction, in 2017, which Beckham had railed in foul-mouthed terms to an aide about his lack of a knighthood.
This is not even the first time he has put his name in the hands of an authoritarian regime. Beckham became Chinas global soccer ambassador in 2013 at a time when the game there had been tarnished by a match-fixing scandal and an exodus of internationals from the countrys Super League. This is a wonderful sport that inspires people across the world and brings families together, so Im relishing the opportunity of introducing more fans to the game, Beckham said then.
Despite it all, the Beckham brand keeps going  and growing. The latest accounts of Beckhams company DB Ventures mention deals with Adidas, the video game company Electronic Arts, the watch brand Tudor and the scotch whisky Haig Club. In 2020, the company posted an after-tax profit of £10.5m on a turnover of £11.3m. This for a man who retired from football in 2013.
He has tended to be resilient because there is an awful lot of goodwill in the bank towards his brand, said Milligan. It comes back to character. Because for so many years he represented a lot of things people value: dedication, patriotism towards England, his work around children [as a Unicef goodwill ambassador] and the fact that everywhere around the world he is liked.
Despite the fact that he is incredibly famous, he has a down-to-earth feeling about him. He queues for 13 hours to see the Queens coffin, he retains the Essex accent, he comes across humbly and that appeals to people around the world, particularly in Asia where humility is highly valued.
Beckham offered a combination of football, fashion and feelgood  and his smartness is often underestimated, Milligan said.
He said: Maybe most importantly he has an ability to recognise and take very good advice. So I think both him and Victoria have made smart decisions on who they have had around them to advise them.
His very first choice of agent before Simon Fuller [former manager of the Spice Girls], when he was on loan at Preston North End, was Alan Shearers agent.
This February, Beckham shuffled his team. Longstanding friend and business manager Dave Gardner stepped aside, and the US giant Authentic Brands Group (ABG) paid $269m (£225m) to take a controlling stake in DB Ventures. Our shared vision makes ABG the ideal strategic partner to help unlock the full potential of my brand and business, Beckham said.
The question is, if there is an effect how long will it last? Milligan said of the impact of Qatar on its star name. If you look at Beckhams history, the show moves on. We have very short memories nowadays. We are highly distractible, with short attention spans and a new story will emerge very quickly after the World Cup. Some may think it is all over for brand Beckham but there is every chance he will bounce right back."

The Building and Wood Workers International has been working with the Qatari government since 2016 and was part of a collective effort that led two years ago to the abolition of the kafala system, under which workers could not change jobs without their employers permission. Union officials, however, now believe that attempts to cement change  including the creation of a migrant workers centre  have been stonewalled and see no sign that sustainable change is coming.
The news will come as a blow to those within football and outside who had been clinging to the prospect of salvaging a positive outcome for a World Cup characterised by human rights concerns, chief among them the deaths of more than 6,500 migrant workers since the tournament was awarded to Qatar in 2010.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
After more than a decade of the Campaign for Decent Work around the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022, two days ahead of the tournament, the Building and Wood Workers International  calls on the Qatari authorities to join with BWI to build on and expand improvements made and to establish a migrant workers centre that will enable workers to have a say in their destinies, the organisation said.
That is a legacy for Qatar and the world that will live on beyond the end of the World Cup tournament. However, to date, there is no sign that sustainable change is forthcoming.
The BWI made three requests to the Qatari labour ministry a year ago, asking for the establishment of a workers centre, implementation of higher health and safety regulations in the construction sector, and more consistent enforcement of the changes already agreed.
The BWI said it was regrettable that it had still not received a response on any of the positive initiatives. Instead, there has been a deafening silence. In football terms, migrant workers are playing the extra time and the result is still unknown.
Whereas some groups have called for a boycott the BWI had chosen to engage with Qatar. The union believes progress has been made. On several occasions, BWI has recognised advances made in Qatar in recent years on labour legislation, it said. Its disappointment is now tangible and has led to frustration with the Qatari government and the tournament organisers, Fifa, which the BWI accuses of failing to live up to its own standards on human rights.
Fifa adopted a human rights policy and BWI was represented on a small body to oversee progress the union said. The policy spells out its commitment to respect all internationally recognised human rights and to promote the protection of these rights. This includes supporting, accompanying, and sustaining reforms and enabling further advances in the protection of the human rights of migrant workers in Qatar toward and beyond 2022.
However, Fifas human rights commitments no longer seem to receive the same priority that they did when the policies were developed and adopted. There is a fundamental conflict between a strong human rights policy and a business as usual approach.
A Qatari government official said: Qatar remains in close dialogue with all its international partners, including the Building and Wood Workers International and the International Labour Organization (ILO), about the future of our labour reform programme.
Qatar first entered its cooperation programme with the ILO in 2017, marking the opening of the first regional project office. We extended this fruitful partnership through 2023 in order to further support the implementation of reforms. Qatar is committed to its journey of progress. What we have achieved in a few short years took decades to achieve in other parts of the world, and in many countries, this process is still ongoing.
Transforming our labour market and protecting the rights of all workers in Qatar is a priority for our government that will continue long after the end of the World Cup.
Fifa has been approached for comment."

The entire country is about 10 times the size of New York City, and all the games will be held in a tight circle of eight stadiums near the capital, Doha.
The British-educated sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani took over from his father nearly a decade ago and maintains control over nearly all aspects of government. Once one of the poorest Gulf states, Qatar has risen to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita on the back of oil and gas.
Qatar has an open-door foreign policy in which it speaks to all political groups, which is why the country has acted as a mediator, for example, between the Taliban and the US. But Qatars support for Islamist groups, such as affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas in Gaza, has caused serious friction with its neighbours.
In June 2017, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabias role, in particular, meant Qatar was effectively cut off from the rest of the world. The blockade was lifted last year.
The small state has an outsized influence across the region and globally due to its 2006 launch of the influential pan-Arab and international TV broadcaster Al Jazeera.
While it is part-owned by the state  and avoids criticism of the Qatari monarchy  Al Jazeera has maintained a level of independence in its reporting, making it a vital source of breaking news across the Middle East, particularly during the Arab spring uprisings that erupted in 2011.
Dictators across the region detest Al Jazeera, which has closely reported on pro-democracy movements and Islamist uprisings. They accuse Qatar of using the channel to foment strife.
Broadly, although not exhaustively, the main arguments made against awarding the tournament to Qatar fall into the following categories:
Migrant workers rights
The role of Qatars huge migrant worker population  often from south and east Asia  in the countrys construction industry has dominated discussions. A Guardian investigation in 2019 found hundreds of labourers had been worked to death in searing temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours per shift, six days a week. Many workers live in squalid, overcrowded dorms, and some interviewed by the Guardian say they earn the equivalent of about £1 an hour.
Responding to the criticism, Qatar introduced a minimum wage and abolished the abusive kafala system, under which workers could not change jobs and were effectively controlled by their employers. Nevertheless in October Amnesty International said human rights abuses persist on a significant scale.
LGBTQ+ rights
Qatar criminalises same-sex sexual activity with jail time and the country ranks poorly on indices of LGBTQ+ rights, even by regional standards.
Last month, Human Rights Watch published a report documenting what it claimed was arbitrary police action against LGBTQ+ residents in Qatar. A Qatari official said the allegations contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false, without specifying.
In an effort at global acceptance, Qatar has explicitly said that LGBTQ+ couples visiting for the World Cup can stay in the same room. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest police will be told not to take action against public displays of affection or pro-LGBTQ+ protests. Still, the grey area is a serious cause for concern. Recent remarks by an official tournament ambassador describing homosexuality as damage in the mind have been decried as harmful and unacceptable.
The climate crisis
Qatar initially proposed holding the tournament during summer, when temperatures average 36C and sometimes reach into the 50s, though in 2015 Fifa confirmed a winter tournament would take place instead.
Doha has promised the first carbon-neutral World Cup in history with its compact design meaning less carbon-emitting travel. But concerns have been expressed over the use of air conditioning in the stadiums and hundreds of thousands of litres of desalinated water needed to keep the pitches lush and green.
Corruption
There is no evidence linking Qatar itself to any kind of corruption in securing its World Cup bid success, but it is 12 years since the host nation was announced, and questions remain about how a country that has never qualified for the tournament won the right to host it. Attention has focused instead on the 22 voting members of Fifas executive committee at the time, 16 of whom have been implicated in or investigated over some form of alleged corruption or bad practice.
Earlier this month the former Fifa president Sepp Blatter claimed the tournament was handed to the Gulf state because of the actions of the former Uefa president Michel Platini, under pressure from Frances then president Nicolas Sarkozy. Platini, a former France player, acknowledges that a meeting with Sarkozy took place but denies his votes were influenced. Sarkozy has previously chosen not to comment on the allegations.
This article was amended on 21 November 2022. Qatar is about 10 times the size of New York City, not a 10th of the size as an earlier version said."

As fans and footballers descend on the Persian Gulf country for the month-long tournament, workers and their families, who have spent 12 years sounding the alarm on exploitative conditions endured while building the tournaments infrastructure, are seeking an amount equivalent to the $440m (£372m) World Cup prize money for a remediation programme.
Qatars labour minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, has previously rejected such proposals, telling the news agency AFP that there was no criteria to establish these funds.
Faced with scorching temperatures and a lack of labour protections, thousands of workers from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and elsewhere have died in the host country since the World Cup was awarded 10 years ago.
While the official number of work-related deaths during preparations for the $220bn project is three, according to the Qataris and Gianni Infantino, Fifas president, the exact number of migrant workers who have died as a result of negligence remains unknown.
Many migrant workers, their families and communities are not able to fully celebrate what they have built, and are calling on Fifa and Qatar to remedy abuses of workers that have left families and communities destitute and struggling, said Rothna Begum, a senior researcher in womens and migrant rights at Human Rights Watch.
The unsettling human cost of the tournament is acute for workers such as Ram Pukar Sahani, who left Nepal for Qatar with his father, Ganga Sahani, in 2017, to earn money to repay family debts.
In May Ram, who had returned home to get married, received a call from Qatar saying that his father, believed to have been healthy, had died while working.
Ram recalled conversations with his father in which he would complain about his work and said Rams job, where he was able to escape to air conditioning and had time to rest, was better.
When Gangas body was returned to Nepal, along with his 9,000 Qatari riyal salary and bonus (£2,000) , no further action or compensation came from the company. His fathers death, he said, was attributed to natural causes.
They are making this a huge event, but I lost my father, Ram said through a translator on Thursday.
There is no debt now, but it took my fathers life to pay back that debt, he said. While the family received insurance money and support from the Nepali government, it wasnt enough, he added.
Gangas death is one of many migrant workers in the past decade that Qatar has failed to investigate, according to an Amnesty International 2021 report that says most migrant worker deaths in Qatar are attributed to natural causes, or cardiac or respiratory failure.
In May, Human Rights Watch and other non-governmental organisations wrote a joint open letter to Fifas president, calling on the sports body and Qatari authorities to remedy past labour abuses and to compensate workers and their families.
Earlier this month, 10 European footballing nations demanded that Fifa deliver a permanent workers rights centre in Qatar and a compensation fund for migrant workers and their families. On Sunday, Amnesty Internationals secretary general, Agnès Callamard, made an urgent plea for compensation to help families rebuild their lives.
To quell mounting criticism, sweeping labour reforms were introduced in 2019, which included ending kafala, the system that made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employers permission. Other reforms included the first minimum wage for migrant workers in the region and harsher penalties for companies that did not comply with the new laws.
This is because of our blood and sweat, said Ram of the tournament, which starts in three days. Look at us, see our conditions, because there are so many people who have made a huge contribution, even losing their life, to make Qatars World Cup possible.

shift, her eyes anxiously scanned the room. If she spotted him, her heart sank. She might spend the next eight hours dodging his requests for a date, for a kiss, for more than that.
Over an 18-month period from mid-2020, Hopes male supervisor at the hotel in Qatar where she was employed repeatedly sexually propositioned her, she says. When she refused his advances, he gave her extra housekeeping work for no additional pay.
I was feeling low, she says on the phone from her home in Kenya, where she returned at the start of this year after her contract in Qatar came to an end. Because when someone tells you such things, you ask yourself: why is he taking advantage of you?
The plight of the tens of thousands of men who travelled thousands of miles to help build Qatars World Cup dream and the exploitation that many faced has been widely documented.
Yet rights groups say the problems facing migrant women have not been explored or scrutinised in the same way, and their voices have been largely absent from the debate on migrant workers rights in the lead up to the tournament.
Women working in the global hospitality industry are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and gender based violence. A survey by the Unite union found that over half of respondents had directly experienced sexual harassment and assault in their workplaces.
The Guardian and the Fuller Project spoke with five women, including Hope, employed at different hotels in Qatar between 2017 and 2022 about their experiences. They detailed allegations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse. Most of these hotels are among more than 100  now endorsed by Fifa, footballs governing body and the tournament organiser.
The testimonies of women interviewed for this piece, as well as those of experts who have worked extensively with female hospitality workers in Qatar, suggest few feel able to report sexual harassment should it occur.
Theres been so much focus on [men working in] construction and the stadiums, as they are central to the tournament, says Isobel Archer, Gulf programme manager at the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a non-profit that has researched working conditions in Qatars hotels. But [sexual harassment] is absolutely happening in hotels.
Although men dominate the countrys migrant workforce, government data shows nearly 300,000 migrant women worked in Qatar as of June this year.
In 2020, female migrants made up just over a fifth of hotel workers, according to the most recent government statistics, although this is probably a significant undercount as the figures exclude subcontracted workers, say rights groups. To cope with the influx of 1.3 million football fans, an additional 108 hotels were built ahead of the start of the tournament.
Archer says that high-profile sporting events are linked to a rise in violence against women, further increasing the risks facing women hotel workers and anticipates the same happening during the World Cup.
She says that urgent action has to be taken by hotels, which will be packed to capacity with football fans, to protect women and allow them to be able to report abuse safely without fear of repercussions.
I dont think weve seen any evidence that hotels are doing anything, frankly, [to support women], she says. And [the women] simply wont be able to speak up.
Qatar representatives said the five womens stories were extreme cases which were not the reality for millions of female workers. Fifa said it took any allegations of misconduct extremely seriously and had a clear process in place for anyone who wanted to report any such incidents.
While women hotel workers across the world face a disproportionate risk of gender based violence compared to other industries, rights groups say that those working in Qatar could find it particularly difficult to report the abuse they may face.
A report published this year by Equidem, a labour rights organisation, said gender-based violence and harassment are a fact of life for women at some Fifa World Cup hotel partners. Equidems researchers contacted more than 800 migrant workers across the region, male and female, but only 10% agreed to have their experiences recorded.
Some women, like Hope, dread deportation. Others might have paid illegal and exorbitant recruitment fees, forcing them to stay in jobs with abusive conditions. Despite sweeping labour reforms in 2019, with migrants now allowed to change jobs or leave the country without an employers permission, workers say little has changed. Employers still have a huge degree of control over employees lives and with migrant worker unions banned, there are few routes to effectively raise grievances.
Migrant women who come to Qatar, mostly from Africa and Asia, are often the main breadwinner for their families. Many are reluctant to speak out because they fear losing those jobs, says Ann Abunda, founder of Sandigan, a Kuwait-based domestic worker organisation. When she asked her network to inquire about issues of harassment in Qatars hotels, more than a dozen women replied, either directly via social media or through her contacts in Qatar.
Women told her there was no point in reporting harassment because employers would not act and were angered by the complaint. [Women] just dont want to talk [publicly] about that, says Abunda. But they are saying its rampant.
The countrys penal code also criminalises sex outside marriage. Police often do not believe women who report sexual violence, instead siding with men who claim it was consensual, which can lead to the survivor facing charges, says Rothna Begum, a senior womens rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Facing further barriers, all women in Qatar need to show they are married in order to access certain forms of sexual and reproductive healthcare, adds Begum. This can include treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy.
In an attempt to tackle violations, Qatars supreme committee has been auditing hotel working conditions, and an online platform for worker complaints was launched last year.
Yet rights groups say audits often do not detect serious abuse as they only provide a snapshot of the situation and rely on input from workers. Women are also reluctant to report issues as sensitive as harassment.
Are you really going to disclose a violation against your body to a complete stranger during a corporate audit? says Archer. Its just a very unlikely scenario.

The Qatari government has said it will intensify labour inspections during the tournament, including extra health and safety checks. Mustafa Qadri, the executive director of Equidem, believes the increased scrutiny over the next month will ensure a degree of protection for workers. Yet fundamental structural problems such as migrant workers being unable to organise and their lack of freedoms wont have been adequately addressed once the worlds attention moves on, he says.
Hotels are not creating an environment for workers to speak up, says Archer. Risk assessments need to be conducted in order to understand who their female migrant workers are and what might make them more susceptible to gender-based violence, she says. Management needs to be trained to spot signs of harassment and to communicate effectively with the entire workforce, particularly subcontracted female employees, who are often at higher risk. Hotels also need to be clear on the reporting process and next steps in terms of safeguarding as well as psychosocial and medical support.
There are reports that restrictions on consensual sex and womens access to reproductive services may be relaxed during the World Cup. Should this happen, says Begum, the Qatari authorities need to ensure it applies to all women, not just fans, inform all women about the changes and ensure they continue beyond the tournament.
In response to the claims of harassment, Fifa said it was steadfast in its commitment to ensuring respect for internationally recognised human rights and takes allegations of misconduct seriously. The body also said it has a number of measures and reporting mechanisms in place for anyone wishing to make a complaint, including a workers welfare hotline. It added that it was implementing an unprecedented due diligence process in relation to the protection of workers involved in the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022, in line with Fifas responsibility under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
A Qatari official said anyone who came forward with a complaint would be supported and their complaint fully investigated: Qatari law prioritises the safety and wellbeing of all women. Assault is criminalised under the penal code, and access to justice is a guaranteed right for everyone through the Qatari court system. Female foreign residents play an important role in Qatars economy and society, and we do not tolerate any infringement to the fundamental human rights of women or anyone in our country.
As in all countries around the world, unfortunate, extreme cases do occur and unscrupulous employers are a reality. But these extreme cases are not representative of the reality of life for the millions of foreign female residents who have lived in Qatar in recent decades. Protecting the rights of all women in Qatar  including female workers  is and will continue to be at the forefront of our priorities and vision.
Sally* was just trying to do her job. Her hotel cleaning shift was nearly over, tiredness was setting in, and the dirty sheets werent going to wash themselves. But the male guest asked for a kiss, she says. When she reported the incident to her supervisor, the reply was essentially: Youre a woman, learn to handle your issues.
What she experienced at the luxury hotel still affects her, says Sally. I dont like getting close to strange men because you never know their intentions. It brings back the memory, she says from her home in Kenya, her voice tearful. I never want to go back. Management often took little action or sided with guests when female workers complained about harassment, say several.
Instead of dealing with harassment allegations directly, one cleaner describes a policy of swapping staff members in and out when guests behave inappropriately.
Once, when a guest tried to slap her, she alleges her supervisor responded by saying she shouldnt have been serving him in the first place.
Its a bit disheartening, she says. Besides sexual harassment, maybe a guest is mishandling you or being rude. All these things you report but nothing [is done]. So you just have to deal with it. It made me feel very small. And vulnerable. At the end of the day, the guest is always right.
For Sally, her friends at the hotel were quite literally her lifeline. When they heard her arguing with the male guest who asked for a kiss, they rushed in to help, she says. Six months later, they burst in again when they heard her say: Dont get any closer.
This time, a senior supervisor snapped into action. The guest reportedly sent his apologies, though Sally wasnt sure if this was true as he never said anything directly to her. Concerned about other women being sent to clean his room, she wanted the guests stay terminated.
But they didnt do that, she says. Its not a privilege for them to have you. Its a privilege for them to have guests.

thoroughbred Lady Princess romped to victory at the Qatar Goodwood Festival, four leading MPs were enjoying the Gulf emirates hospitality.
The recipients at the West Sussex festival in July 2021 included the speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, and Conservative MP Nigel Evans, honorary president of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on UK-Qatar relations.
In the 12 years since the tiny, gas-rich state was named as the host of World Cup 2022, reigniting scrutiny of its oppression of LGBTQ+ people and its questionable record on human rights, Qatar has doubled down on enhancing its decades-old friendship with British politicians.
At least 58 British MPs have been flown to Doha at the emirates expense since it was awarded in 2010, a Guardian analysis of public records shows.
Those trips have come at a cost of more than £400,000  more than £250,000 in the last year alone. That is on top of the £4,000 worth of food, drink and accommodation donated to the quartet of MPs on that July day at Goodwood, rebranded in 2015 under a 10-year sponsorship deal, courtesy of Qatars ministry of sport and its UK embassy.
Over the same period, ministers have received ornaments, a rug and luxury hampers from Fortnum & Mason and Qatar-owned Harrods, while the emir sent Boris Johnson a clock in 2019 on his appointment as prime minister.
In some cases, analysis by the Observer found last month that MPs appeared to speak favourably of Qatar in parliament after benefiting from the emirates largesse.
Professor David Roberts, a Gulf region and defence expert at Kings College London, said: The Qataris clearly feel that they are buying something, a certain understanding or sympathy.
They would say its educating people as to their side of the story and its not unreasonable for them to point to the improvements theyve made.
But in practice, Qatars influence in the UK is founded on far more than hospitality and gifts.
The relationship has flourished thanks to multibillion-pound arms contracts, royal friendships, vital gas imports and £40bn of Qatari investment in the UK, all contributing to an influence network that reaches to the heart of government.
Members of Qatars ruling Al Thani family, including the current emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, were educated in the UK. Many more have made London their second home, building unrivalled connections to the very pinnacle of British social hierarchy.
Earlier this year, the Sunday Times claimed that Qatars former prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, had given the then Prince of Wales, now King Charles III, 3m in charitable donations in cash between 2011 and 2015, some of it in Fortnum & Mason bags.
The Emir, Tamim Al Thani, was one of the few Gulf leaders to attend the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. His cousin, horse racing enthusiast Hamad bin Abdullah, was among the even more select group at her committal, at Windsor Castle.
Fittingly, the military forces commanded by the sovereigns of both nations operate in lockstep under an arms supply arrangement that dates back to 1996, the year after a bloodless coup put in place the current Qatari line of succession.
In September, the emir watched at Dukhan Airbase as his air force took delivery of the first batch of 24 Eurofighter Typhoons, built in Lancashire and supplied as part of a £5bn deal with BAE Systems.
Qatar has also bought F-35s from the US and Dassault Rafale jets from France, spreading its purchases in a move that may be more about international alliances than coherent air power strategy, according to defence analyst Francis Tusa.
It makes no sense for them to run three separate fighter planes, he said.
You cant share simulators and they dont have the same engines, so maintenance is completely different.
Its very much a political move. Theyve used the defence dollar to buy influence with Britain, France and the US.
So close is UK-Qatari cooperation in the skies that it has spawned two joint squadrons between the nations air forces, the first, according to the RAF Museum, since British pilots flew alongside counterparts from countries including France, Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1944.
One of them, 12 Squadron, will patrol the skies above the stadiums during the World Cup, its pilots among 200 RAF personnel who will deploy to the Gulf state during the World Cup as part of the security mission dubbed Project Thariyat.
The roots of this military relationship go back 100 years. A British protectorate from 1916 to 1971, Qatar declared independence around the same time that it discovered one of the worlds largest gas fields, shared with Iran.
The former emir, Hamad bin Khalifa, and his prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, shrewdly funnelled that natural resource windfall into a sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), founded in 2005. In just 17 years, the QIA has rapidly become a $450bn global investment powerhouse.
Qatars fearsome financial muscle, flexed via the QIA as well its ruling elites personal wealth, has been used not just to buy up prestige assets in London  such as Harrods and Claridges Hotel  but also to purchase military hardware, leading to controversy on one occasion.
In 1996, BAE Systems and Qatar signed a £500m arms contract, brokered by then-Tory defence minister Michael Portillo, that included the supply of Piranha armoured vehicles. It later emerged that the deal involved the transfer of £7m into two Jersey trusts of which Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, then foreign minister, was a beneficiary.
The funds were frozen by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, which then began a court case and investigation. In 2002, the Guardian reported that HBJ had paid the Jersey authorities £6m as a voluntary reparation as the structures put in place by his advisers may have contributed to the cost and complexity of the inquiry.

The case was dropped and BAE, and HBJ denied any wrongdoing.
In the years that followed, Qatars relations with Tony Blairs Britain improved, particularly after the emirate allowed its airbases to be used as a staging post for military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
More recently, the relationship has focused on a different kind of security  energy.
Qatar is a key source of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the alternative to pipeline supplies from Europe, which are under threat as Russia turns off the tap in a standoff over Ukraine.
At times over the past decade, Qatar has supplied nearly all of Britains LNG, a form of ship-transported, hyper-cooled gas that accounts for about a fifth of UK supply.
The emirates share of UK LNG imports has declined since hitting 98% in 2012 but, amid soaring gas prices even before the war, Boris Johnson asked the emir for help in late 2021. Talks about sustainable gas supplies continued into this year.
In May, the two nations issued a joint communique stating that Qatar planned to invest £10bn in the UK. Johnson and the Emir went on to discuss the upcoming World Cup, for which former England captain David Beckham has served, controversially, as an ambassador.
Military and energy alliances define the Qatari-UK relationship but it has also blossomed thanks to political connections.
The all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Qatar counts 14 MPs and Lords as members, and the group has made several trips to Doha on fact-finding missions.
Earlier this year, Alun Cairns became chairman of the APPG as a result of a ballot that attracted votes from 91 MPs. The APPG has previously refused to comment on reports that Qatar had been keen to see him installed as its chairman.
Cairns said the group played an active role in scrutinising all aspects of UK-Qatar relations, including human rights, ethics, education, energy and infrastructure.
Questions have been raised about the presence of two businessmen during one of the groups trips to Qatar.
An Isle of Man-based hedge fund, Argo Capital Management, has been named as the APPGs secretariat, with Argo employee Jeremy Bradshaw listed as the groups point of contact.
One MP, who spoke to Business Insider, said Bradshaw was present during the groups visit to Qatar in 2021. Bradshaw did not respond to the Guardians questions about his reported presence on the trip.
Bradshaw once stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate and is reportedly a friend of Nigel Evans, deputy speaker of the House of Commons and honorary president of the Qatar APPG. He is also listed as a point of contact for the Conservative parliamentary China group.
Bradshaw told the Guardian he had since stood down from his role with the APPG.
Another figure who reportedly organised a lunch with a Qatari official during the same trip is Dominic Armstrong, a corporate intelligence expert and co-founder of private military company Aegis Defence Services.
Armstrong attended a 2021 meeting between trade minister Lord Grimstone, Rolls-Royce and two members of the Qatari ruling elite.
It was one of six meetings that Grimstone held with Qatari companies and representatives that year, culminating in the emirate making an £85m investment in Rolls-Royces plans to build a fleet of small nuclear reactors. Armstrong has previously confirmed that he acted as an adviser on the deal.
Armstrong did not return requests for comment."

By the start of this week, when the team started arriving at their World Cup training base, the maintenance was complete. The shrubbery in question, perfectly spaced and perched upon a neatly cultivated hill separating their two assigned training pitches, was fashioned into letters spelling out ASPIRE ACADEMY.
In July, when the Socceroos announced they would stay here for the duration of the tournament, a brief public narrative formed that their late qualification had forced Football Australia staff to settle for second-rate dormitory accommodation while their higher-profile counterparts opted for secluded wellness resorts (Germany), uber-rich water parks (Belgium) and hotels resembling palaces (France).
This rendering of the Australian camp as subpar is not close to reality. Because the Aspire Academy does not start and end with diverting topiary. The facility is, like much of what Qatars petrodollars produce, elite to the point of almost incomparability with anything else anywhere in the rest of the world.
Located on the western side of Doha, it has trained and educated thousands of young athletes, mainly in football but also in other sports including athletics, fencing, squash and table tennis. The base features eight football pitches including one in the Aspire Dome, a rather large (huge) indoor climate-controlled training complex.
In all, it cost $1.3bn to build. Once that was done, in 2004, it was launched by Pelé. Diego Maradona was there too. It has since been praised by Zinedine Zidane, Glenn Hoddle, Sven-Göran Eriksson and, more recently, David Beckham. (We will come to Tim Cahill in a bit.) Suffice to say it is kind of a big deal.

A crucial element of the Socceroos arrangement is that  like Qatars national team  they are staying on site (Ghana are also training here minus the sleepovers), eradicating a key logistical irritation for the players of having to travel between a hotel and training each day.
Its refreshing, midfielder Riley McGree said on Wednesday. I think those bus rides, especially after training when its a little bit of a long one, arent great. But being right on the training pitch you literally walk in, walk out, go back to your room, go to meals, go to physio and everything.
It definitely makes it a whole lot more convenient and the facilities here are second to none, so theres been no complaints. Its been awesome.

In terms of setting Australia up for the best possible chance of on-field success, it is indeed awesome. All the more because staff have furnished the place in green and gold and motivational messaging, brought their in-house chef and even flown in a barista.
And yet the plush surroundings also feel somewhat uneasy. Aspire, which has been showered in state funding for the best part of two decades, is the centrepiece of Qatars football project, a project accused of sportswashing, corruption and human rights abuses. The Garcia report of 2014, which examined the bidding process for the 2022 World Cup, states the academys resources were used to curry favour with Fifa executive committee members.
Aspire has also come under scrutiny for its Football Dreams project, a mass talent-scouting operation across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Launched in 2007, it is self-described as a unique humanitarian project; critics say it has been a vehicle for peddling influence in other Fifa nations as well as naturalising talented kids in time to field a credible World Cup national team.

Qatar denies this, but Aspires efforts have nonetheless yielded results. In 2014, Qatar won the Asian U19 championship, and in 2018 the senior team won the Asian Cup  both times under former La Masia coach Félix Sánchez. More than two-thirds of the squad had been trained at Aspire. Since being awarded the World Cup in 2010, the team have climbed from No 113 to No 51 in the Fifa rankings.
However you spin it, Aspires legacy is angsty, featuring both good and bad and plenty in between. Regardless, as a state-run enterprise it is difficult to think of it as anything but synonymous with Qatars broader football agenda. It has also become synonymous with Tim Cahill, Aspires chief sports officer, who is, in turn, synonymous with the Socceroos. That complicates Australias place in the landscape.
In 2020, the former striker and current national treasure made the decision to become a Qatar 2022 ambassador. Several months ago he was critical in securing the Socceroos setup here. On Tuesday the 42-year-old was announced as part of Australias official World Cup staff under the title of head of delegation.
His first quote in the media release read: The Aspire Academy is recognised as one of the worlds leading sports academies and I am thrilled that we have been able to secure these facilities for our national team during this tournament.
This is not to say the Socceroos should not have accepted Aspires hospitality in good faith. The players have made a strong and nuanced statement on human rights when they were not obliged to do so. It is also nigh on impossible to play at a World Cup without also having somewhere to train and sleep in the host country. More than anything, the situation is just one example of the complexities that exist within the larger, thorny web that constitutes this uncomfortable tournament and all its trappings.
There is a sense Australia may be treading delicately with Qatar, a fellow Asian Football Confederation member where the Socceroos not only played numerous qualifiers during the pandemic, but will undoubtedly have to return in the future."

Some greeted the clips with scepticism, although the Guardian spoke to half a dozen supporters on the ground who said they were originally from Kerala and displayed a broad knowledge of the England team and the Premier League. Other locals have been seen chanting their support for Argentina and Brazil.

Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
In a statement the Supreme Committee said it rejected the allegations about fake fans, which they called disappointing and unsurprising.
Fans from all over the world  many of whom have made Qatar their home  have contributed to the local atmosphere recently, organising fan walks and parades throughout the country, and welcoming the various national teams at their hotels, it said in a statement.
Numerous journalists and commentators on social media have questioned whether these are real fans. We thoroughly reject these assertions, which are both disappointing and unsurprising.
Hundreds of England-supporting Indian fans shouted Its coming home as well as Southgate is our super coach! Sterling is our super star! Pickford is our super keeper! as the England team arrived at their five-star hotel on Tuesday.
One England supporter from Kerala who led the chants described suggestions that he and the others were receiving cash to be cheerleaders as fake news.
None of us is getting paid, he said. We are diehard England fans. My favourite player was Beckham, but now it is Saka. If someone offered to pay us to support England we would turn them down. We are genuine supporters. Many of us grew up watching Beckham and Michael Owen. Our love is to this team.

The Supreme Committee also said football fans celebrated differently based on where they were in the world.
Qatar, and the rest of the world, is comprised of a diverse range of football fans, many of whom share emotional connections with multiple nations, it said. In different places around the world, fans have different traditions, different ways to celebrate, and while that may contrast with what people are used to in Europe or South America, it doesnt mean the passion for football is any less authentic. Journalists on the ground who speak to and meet these fans are realising the reality.

Journalists from the TV2 channel were mistakenly interrupted late on Tuesday evening, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy acknowledged in a statement. Upon inspection of the crews valid tournament accreditation and filming permit an apology was made to the broadcaster by on?site security before the crew resumed their activity, organisers said.
The reporter Rasmus Tantholdt was speaking live to a news anchor in Denmark when three men drove up behind him on an electric cart and tried to block the camera lens.
You invited the whole world to come here, why cant we film? Its a public place, Tantholdt was heard saying in English. You can break the camera, you want to break it? You are threatening us by smashing the camera?
The incident five days before the World Cup starts revisited a subject that has been sensitive for tournament organisers who have denied claims there are strict limits on where media can film in Qatar. Organisers said they later spoke to Tantholdt and also issued an advisory to all entities to respect the filming permits in place for the tournament.
Denmarks football federation has also been one of the biggest critics of Qatar among the 32 World Cup teams over the emirates record on human rights and treatment of low-paid migrant workers. They were needed to build massive construction projects since Fifa picked Qatar as hosts in 2010.
Danish players will wear match shirts that have a toned down badge and manufacturers logo as a protest in support of labour rights when they play France, Australia and Tunisia in Group D. A third-choice black shirt option has been included as the colour of mourning for construction workers who have died in Qatar.

Meanwhile the Norway manager, Stale Solbakken, has accused football of not doing enough to prevent Qatar hosting the finals. Lise Klaveness, president of the Norwegian Football Federation, spoke out strongly about the award of the tournament to the Gulf state at the Fifa Congress in March, and the nation will be sending only one member of staff  an analyst to run the rule over their Euro 2024 qualifying opponents Spain.
Asked about Norways opposition as he prepared for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Thursday night, Solbakken said: I think that first of all Fifa has the biggest failing, given the circumstances back when Qatar was given the tournament [in 2010]. That is obviously the biggest mistake.
After that, I dont think football has done enough, I dont think journalists have done enough. I think you also have been asleep for a long, long time. I think its only in the last years that its suddenly: Oh, the World Cup is in Qatar. The first years after it was given to Qatar, I think the whole world was more or less asleep, including football people and also journalists."

A spotlight has been shone on the Gulf emirates repression of women and LGBTQ people, and its punishing exploitation of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. But the picture is incomplete. The fact is that the roots of Qatari repression extend well beyond Qatar, connecting the emirate to the supposedly liberal states of the west.
Much of the discourse around the World Cup has carried the implication that abuses in Qatar are an outgrowth of a local conservative culture, as juxtaposed with more enlightened western values. In fact, the persistence of monarchical rule in the Gulf is the result of more than a century of collusion between local elites and the west. If we are serious in our objections to the abuses found in Qatar, then we need to consider how Qatari authoritarianism sits within a much wider system of power, violence and exploitation.
The processes of state formation that brought the modern Qatari state into being are inextricably bound up with histories of capitalism and western imperialism. It was British imperial power that first integrated the Gulf states of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman into the structures of the global economy with discoveries of vast oil and gas reserves sealing the regions status as a major material and geostrategic prize.
To ensure British influence and privileged access to this prize, local monarchies such as the Al-Thani family in Qatar were built up and buttressed against external and internal challenges. Britain worked with these client elites to develop systems of internal repression designed to foreclose any possibility of nationalist forces overthrowing the monarchies and breaking ties with the west. Even after the Gulf states gained independence in the 1960s and 70s, scores of British civilians remained in their militaries and state bureaucracies, including in Qatars, to ensure the regimes survival and their correct geopolitical orientation.
In more recent years, Qatar has become one of the worlds leading arms importers, with the regimes military muscle now provided by the United States, France and other western suppliers. These include the UK, whose contribution includes a fleet of Typhoon military jets. And with its al-Udeid airbase playing host to the forward headquarters of the US militarys Central Command, Qatar sits right at the heart of western power projection into the Gulf, as it has done for more than 100 years.
The peoples of the Gulf are no more or less desiring of basic rights and autonomy than the rest of the human race. If repressive monarchy has not given way to democracies and republics in the Gulf as it has elsewhere in the world, this is at least partly owing to a sustained and intensive intervention from the western powers on the side of the local elites.
The false notion that authoritarianism in the Gulf is simply a reflection of regional culture has its roots in the Orientalist discourse of the colonial era. To this day, racist caricatures of an enlightened west encountering the backward despotisms of the Middle East obscures the relevant history and legitimises the wests role in the region. This self-serving mythology externalises and circumscribes the blame for human rights abuses in states like Qatar, while preserving a narcissistic sense of western innocence.
The regimes themselves are happy to play along with these fictions, presenting themselves as visionary reformers of societies hidebound by tradition and asking the west for patience as they struggle valiantly against the backwardness of their own people.
The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was widely hailed as a reformer until the bubble was burst by the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi among a wider, inescapable record of abuses. The Gulf regimes and their western allies have both told the reform story many times, but in truth the only reforms they are interested in are those that deflect political pressure and shore up the conservative regional order.
As an act of sportswashing, this winters World Cup fits squarely into these narratives. Playing into Orientalist notions of tradition versus modernisation, the tournament is designed to showcase a Qatari regime heading in the right direction and deserving of the worlds embrace. This is aimed at something more specific than burnishing Qatars international public image per se.
The real goal is to provide Qatars western allies with an alibi for continuing the support that has been so crucial to the regimes longevity. It is soft power as the currency that buys hard power, with the entire global football community recruited into the transaction.
As a Potemkin village of 21st-century capitalism, the 2022 World Cup is not a phenomenon separate from or alien to the west. It is a representative example of the world that western power built. The western brands sponsoring the tournament benefit just as the regime does from the continued exploitation of migrant labour that is making the tournament possible.
And to the extent that the tournament serves to sportswash authoritarianism, it will be sportswashing an authoritarianism that has long been a joint venture between the west and Qatar. Only when the spotlight shines on the role of our own governments will true accountability for all this be possible.

always been intertwined in Australia. From its introduction by British migrants in the late 19th century and the rise of postwar ethnic clubs, to the dismissiveness of the phrase wog-ball and the jubilation of the 2006 squad filled with first and second generation migrants, football and migrant communities have been inseparable bedfellows.
It is a link that remains just as strong today, with the Socceroos squad announced for the 2022 World Cup featuring players from Bosnian, Croatian, Turkish-Cypriot and South African backgrounds. And in a trio of players with South Sudanese backgrounds  Awer Mabil, Garang Kuol and Thomas Deng  the Socceroos have a new generation of diaspora players to reflect both changing face of the squad and of the country.
Their inclusion by coach Graham Arnold reflects both their rise to prominence  Kuol, for example, recently secured a move to Premier League side Newcastle United  and the increased diversity of the playing pool at youth level.
Considering the latest census results show almost half of Australians have a parent born overseas  and just under a third are born overseas themselves  it would be inaccurate to call the squad diverse. They are, and always have been, a mirror reflection of Australia.
This group of players reflects the realities of the ethnic makeup of Australia better than competing sporting codes, politics and the media. It is a point driven home by Craig Foster, the former Socceroos captain and current human rights activist, who says it is far from surprising to see varying communities represented in the squad.
The Australian male national team has reflected the changing face of the country for 100 years. And if you go through all of the different iterations and decades, and for World Cup squads, you see the face of Australias immigration, he tells Guardian Australia. Today, we now see our new African-Australian diaspora start to be reflected through the team, and its wonderful to see.
Asked why Australian football is so deeply intertwined with migration, Foster takes a moment, reflecting on communities who came to Australia with football in their heart.
Of all of the sports that Australias immigrant communities most love, overwhelmingly, the majority of them come from football loving countries, he says. When the majority of immigrants come to Australia and settle into life, one of their great passions they want to bring to life is to be involved, or to form their own clubs, in association football. Its the worlds biggest sport.
Australia, and Australian football, is better for its diversity.
It is a belief shared by many in the football landscape, particularly at youth levels, where coaches see the frontline of change. Craig Carley, a senior coach at Goulburn Valley Suns Football Club and a previous coach of Kuol, says he has witnessed the face of football changing, and he believes it will only lead to a better Socceroos squad.
I can certainly see a shift  football is changing, its becoming more diverse, Carley says. And I think its just brilliant for the sport. What we see locally is only going to benefit everyone, certainly the Socceroos as well. With the shift, it creates a wider pool of players, and these players are starting to be recognised for their talent. Its amazing and inspiring for other young players.
Carley believes the process that has diversified the Socceroos  of players from migrant backgrounds climbing the ranks through the youth systems  would only lead to an improved squad. But he adds that there is a key prohibitive factor: the cost of youth football, particularly if a player reaches higher levels such as the National Premier League, Australias second tier.
I think Australia would be ranked a lot higher in the world if they gave more diverse players opportunities, he says. Its been a massive challenge, and I have no doubt whatsoever that it has impacted the national team selection. We should have a far more diverse team, and I think in years to come, the team will change.
I think this issue has been completely detrimental to the senior team  there is just so much talent thats been missed because players cant go to training or games, cant get the right gear, and wont get the right opportunities.
The frustration at costs as an impediment to development is a common one, particularly for coaches like Carley who see the potential directly. Paul Giordano, secretary of the Azzurri Sports Club and Adelaide Blue Eagles, where Deng started his playing career, says he has seen lots of talent go to waste.
People pay a lot of money to play this sport, which, especially for new immigrants to this country who want to play the sport, becomes prohibitive, Giordano says. The problem isnt getting them to the top, its getting them in at the bottom.
Once youre identified as a good player, people recognise that and theyre willing to help. But its that initial step. If you turn around and say, well, you can play junior squad, but the fees are $900 or $1,200, or $1,500, that initial step might just be too much. People cant afford that.

Despite these challenges, the game is still changing at a rapid pace, and Giordano has seen it happen up close. He has seen his club and many others around Australia have to change their names and de-ethnicise. He remembers when, in 1996, Soccer Australia ordered clubs to remove all symbols of European nationalism from club logos, playing strips, club flags, stadium names, and letterheads.
David Hill, the Soccer Australia boss at the time, said it was to Australianise the struggling National Soccer League, an idea that still stings today.
It was like trying to erase our history, and I know our club amongst many were very upset by the situation, that you had to denounce the name of your club. Thats how we became the Blue Eagles, Giordano says. Like with anything, we want our history acknowledged.
The decision was made in an attempt to broaden the reach of football, to access mainstream Australians, bearing an underlying assumption that the migrant communities who built up football were not part of mainstream Australia.
To Giordano, any success in Australian football is always owed to some degree to migrant communities, particularly the postwar wave of migrants from southern and eastern Europe who formed the bedrock of footballing infrastructure in Australia.
Theyre the Greek, Bosnian, Italian, Macedonian, Croatian and Serbian communities who blazed the trail for other diasporas, who then set the stage and cemented the connection between the Socceroos and migrant communities.
But they have not been without their controversies, most recently at this years Australia Cup final, when some fans of Sydney United 58 FC, an old NSL club, chanted songs with fascist links, booed during the Welcome To Country and performed Nazi salutes.
It is an incident that reflects the ongoing tensions between old football and new football, and the long journey ahead to mend a footballing culture still somewhat in two minds about what it wants to be and how to acknowledge its cultural roots. It makes the Socceroos the stitching between these eras, cultures and communities, the common ground that everyone unites around every four years.
To Francis Awaritefe, former Socceroos player and chair of the players union, Professional Footballers Australia, the game of football itself is a uniting force.
When you look at the game of football, especially in these very febrile times, with all the divisive rhetoric around, I think football is very well positioned as a sport to really bring people together and unite people, Awaritefe says. Im so proud to see the face of the game changing. Its part of the DNA of football to be egalitarian, diverse and inclusive.
But Awaritefe warns that it is important to avoid complacency, and says footballs diversity could become a weakness if we dont look after it, and we dont nurture those values.
Respect, and respect for human rights has to always be central. Weve seen how racism can grip other codes, how Indigenous or migrant players are treated in other sports. So its really important that we dont allow ourselves to become complacent around the diversity of the game, so that we can continue to nurture it, because it is a massive strength. Its in the DNA of the sport."

Ive seen the human cost,"On a corner of my desk stands a giant stack of external hard drives. They hold the story, gigabyte after gigabyte, of almost a decade of reporting on the lives of Nepals migrant workers in the World Cup host nation, Qatar.
On one, I recently found a photo from July 2013 of Tilak Bishwakarma holding a picture of his son Ganesh. When he left his home for Qatar, Ganesh was a teenager hoping to earn some money to support his impoverished family. Two months later his body was brought home in a coffin.
I opened another photo, showing a tattered piece of paper, listing the names of 22 other Nepali workers who died in Qatar that July. Beside each name is written the cause of death: electrocution, falls, road traffic accident. On 17 July came Ganeshs name. Cause of death: cardiac arrest.
Ganeshs short life formed part of a major investigation into the treatment of Qatars vast low-wage migrant workforce (almost 90% of the countrys population comprises migrant workers). It revealed an appalling catalogue of abuses  overcrowded, filthy accommodation, passport confiscation and non-payment of wages  which in some cases may have amounted to forced labour, a modern form of slavery.
When the Guardian published its exclusive story in September 2013 after I saw the coffins of Nepali workers returning home from the Gulf, it made headlines around the world. Football was literally coming down to a matter of life and death. There was something deeply offensive about the exploitation of some of the worlds poorest people in the name of a festival of sport.
Fifa immediately said it was very concerned, though clearly not concerned enough to have done its own due diligence. The next day Qatars World Cup organisers sent a letter to the games governing body assuring it that they viewed the Guardians findings with the utmost seriousness. Attached to the letter was a one-page Workers Charter setting out, in skeletal form, their commitment to workers rights.
For the next nine years, that commitment would be relentlessly tested and challenged by the Guardians reporting. (If you value our dogged pursuit of justice, safety and fairness, please consider supporting our journalism today.)
We exposed how workers from North Korea were building a tower block  now a luxury hotel booked up by football fans  under conditions likely to constitute slave labour.
We documented the poverty wages being paid to the men constructing the new stadiums. In 2014 one told us he was earning overtime pay the equivalent of 45 pence an hour. Four years later another said his basic wage worked out at 60 pence an hour  10,000 times less than the reported earnings of Lionel Messi.
We revealed that thousands of south Asian workers had died in Qatar in the decade after it won the right to host the World Cup, many from sudden and unexplained causes. The Qatari authorities have done little to investigate these deaths and countless families of the deceased have not received compensation from their employers.
Last year we found workers employed at opulent Fifa-endorsed hotels trapped by recruitment debts and rogue employers, earning less in a month than the cost of a standard room for a night.
And in September we revealed that some labourers at World Cup stadiums were living in squalid, windowless cabins on the edge of the desert.
Low-wage migrant workers face a cruel choice: stay at home and suffer, or take the risk and go abroad. For some the gamble pays off  money is sent home, houses are rebuilt and children sent to school  but for too many its a bet they lose.
Reporting from Qatar is not easy, but the only way to really tell this story is to be on the ground, feel the searing heat, see the overcrowded labour camps and listen. And thats the hardest part. People are afraid to speak, because however tough their circumstances are, they need the work, so why put that at risk to talk to a journalist?
Before each trip I agree protocols with my editor in the event that Im detained (as a number of journalists have been). Once in Qatar, I am constantly looking over my shoulder, metaphorically and literally. Interviews take place at night, or parked up on a quiet street or in the back of a nondescript restaurant. But by working independently and undercover we have been able to expose what they hoped to keep hidden.
So as the World Cup kicks off, if you value reading about the action in the stadiums, but also about the people who built them, please consider supporting a news organisation determined to expose the truth behind the slick PR of Big Football and the Gulf petrocrats. You can fund our work today, from just £1. If you can, please consider giving a little more each month or year.
It makes a difference. The cumulative pressure of our reporting, alongside the work of human rights groups and trade unions, forced the Qatari authorities to belatedly introduce a number of new laws that have the potential to create real change for low-wage workers.
The abusive kafala system, under which workers cannot change jobs without their employers permission, has  on paper  been abolished and a minimum wage has been introduced.
The reforms have neither gone far enough nor been implemented rigorously. But thats why this work matters. When the Qatari authorities and Fifa make overblown claims about what they have achieved, we will challenge them.
Our reporters know that its about so much more than what happens on the pitch.

Gianni Infantino, Fifas president, wants us to focus solely on football. Many will. But the World Cups impact should not only be measured on the balance sheet or the tournaments roll of honour, but in the realities of ordinary peoples lives. These are just some of the numbers that shame Qatars shiny new stadiums and the 22nd edition of the World Cup:
Amount Qatar is reported to have spent on getting the World Cup ready, compared with around $11bn spent by Russia in 2018.
Number of human rights clauses or conditions concerning labour protections requested by Fifa of the Qatari authorities when awarding hosting rights in 2010.
Official number of worker deaths during World Cup 2022 preparations, according to the Qataris and Infantino. Nicholas McGeehan of human rights organisation Fair Square calls that number a wilful attempt to mislead as it focuses on projects that account for only 1% of construction in Qatar. The Supreme Committee says that a further 36 workers from stadium sites also died, but for non-work reasons  ie, they died after a days work due to natural causes.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws.

According to Human Rights Watch Qatari authorities have failed to investigate the causes of deaths of thousands of migrant workers, many of which are attributed to natural causes. HRW also found that, in such cases, families seldom receive compensation for deaths because, under Qatari labour law, deaths not considered work-related are not entitled to compensation.
Migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka reported by the Guardian to have died in Qatar between 2010, when it was awarded the tournament, and 2021.
Nepali worker deaths due to heat in Qatar, according to a 2019 study in the journal Cardiology that found a correlation, concluding that as many as 200 of the 571 cardiovascular deaths [of Nepali workers] during 2009-17 could have been prevented with effective heat protection measures. We know workers are undergoing medical assessments before leaving their home countries and upon arrival, says Isobel Archer, of the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre. Theyre deemed to be fit and healthy, yet we know there have been many, many deaths among previously fit and healthy young men on such a scale that it would be astonishing in any other context.
Minimum figure for number of migrant workers Amnesty International consider to have been exploited and suffered abuse because of lax labour laws and insufficient access to justice in Qatar in the past 12 years.
Hours worked a day by many migrant workers in Qatar, particularly in the domestic and security sectors, according to Amnesty. A recent report by Equidem found many similar stories, including from a Kenyan worker who described working 14-hour days at the Lusail Stadium without paid overtime for more than two years.
Legal minimum wage a month in Qatar (1,000 riyals), the equivalent of about £1 an hour, although food and accommodation are provided. In recent years, the authorities have introduced a number of labour reforms, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the abolition of the kafala, or sponsorship, system. However, human rights groups say it has been piecemeal and many abuses still take place.
Range in dollars paid as a recruitment fee by some migrant workers from India, Bangladesh, Nepal and elsewhere seeking work in Qatar. While this is now illegal, many workers are still struggling to repay their recruitment fees, and associated debts, and send money to their families.
Qatars rating, out of 180 countries, on the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index. That makes it one of the better countries in the region, however reporters have still been warned by human rights groups that they are likely to face surveillance at the World Cup.
Years in prison that men and women who have sexual relations outside marriage can face under 281 article of the penal code. HRW say this disproportionately affects women, who have been prosecuted if they report rape. It says police often do not believe women who report such violence, instead believing the men who claim it was consensual, and any evidence or suggestion that a woman knew the male offender has been enough to prosecute the woman.
Cases of ill-treatment in detention for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people between 2019 and 2022, according to a report by HRW in October 2022. It said that Qatar Preventive Security Department forces have arbitrarily arrested LGBT people and subjected them to ill-treatment in detention including six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022. As a requirement for their release, security forces mandated that transgender women detainees attend conversion therapy sessions at a government facility. According to the authorities, however, there are no gay conversion centres in Qatar.
Possible number of years imprisonment under article 296 of Qatars penal code for leading, instigating or seducing a male in any way to commit sodomy or dissipation and inducing or seducing a male in any way to commit illegal or immoral actions.
Amount Amnesty and others believe Fifa should make available to help compensate migrant workers who have died or suffered injury in Qatar. That is equivalent to the World Cups prize money. However, Qatars labour minister has rejected such proposals, claiming criticism of the government counts as racist. The minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, told AFP there was no criteria to establish these funds, and asked: Where are the victims? Do you have names of the victims? How can you get these numbers?"

Agnès Callamard urged the world football governing body to issue a cast-iron commitment that abused workers will be compensated and that programmes to prevent further abuses are funded, adding that such a package would go a long way towards helping victims and their families rebuild their lives.
She also fiercely criticised Fifa president Gianni Infantinos request to World Cup teams that they should focus on the football rather than discussing human rights issues in Qatar. Infantinos letter is a crass attempt at shirking Fifas culpability, Callamard said.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
In the letter, sent last month, Infantino had suggested critics were handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world and said nations should not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists.
Rather than calming criticism of Qatar, the letter angered human rights groups and football leaders, with countries including England and Wales saying they would continue campaigning on off-pitch issues. Human rights are universal and they apply everywhere, they said in a joint statement with eight other European football associations.
The hosting of the World Cup by Qatar has attracted protest worldwide over LGBTQ+ rights and labour issues. Ten captains of European teams have said they will wear One love armbands to promote diversity and inclusion during the tournament. While, last month, Australia released a video in which players criticised Qatars human rights record.
Last week, the Danish football association said Fifa had rejected a request to allow its players to train at the World Cup in shirts with the words human rights for all on them due to technical reasons.
Also last week, Englands largest LGBTQ+ supporters group criticised David Beckham for his role as a paid ambassador for the Qatar World Cup, saying it was incredibly disappointing that he had taken the role given that Qatari law criminalises homosexual behaviour.
Im just so disappointed because we  the LGBTQ+ football family  have put David Beckham on a pedestal, as a great ally, said Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group.
The comments from Callamard come six months after Amnesty and 24 other rights groups wrote to Infantino urging Fifa to establish a remediation programme for the abuses suffered by workers in Qatar.
The rights groups say hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, predominantly from south and south-east Asia and Africa, have been subjected to rampant labour abuses including extortionate recruitment fees, conditions amounting to forced labour, lost and unpaid wages, and long hours without days off.
It also highlighted the cases of workers harmed in Qatar, including a Nepali citizen, Tul Bahadur Gharti, who is reported to have died in his sleep in November 2020 after working more than 10 hours in extreme heat on a construction site.
A death certificate issued by the Qatari authorities said that Gharti, 34, died of natural causes.The call for compensation has been backed by the football associations of England, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the US, and by World Cup sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Budweiser and McDonalds. However, Qatar has disputed reports about the scale of the labour abuses and rejected calls for a Fifa-led compensation fund, describing them as a publicity stunt.
In an op-ed for international media on Friday, Callamard wrote: Amid this growing clamour, the most crucial voice of all has remained conspicuously silent: Gianni Infantino.
Despite private and public assurances from Fifa that they are considering the proposal, Infantino, a few platitudes aside, has consistently dodged the topic. To date, he has provided no response to our joint letter.
She added that given the well-documented history of labour-rights abuse in Qatar, Fifa knew  or should have known  the obvious risks to workers when it awarded Qatar the tournament.
A pledge from Infantino to provide compensation would provide a tangible demonstration that Fifa is truly serious about its commitment to respect human rights, she said.
In a statement to AFP last month, Qatars labour minister, Ali bin Samikh Al-Marri, said the Gulf state was already handing out hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid wages, and described critics as racist. He added that the ministrys door is open, saying that if there is a person entitled to compensation who has not received it, they should come forward and we will help them.
In response to the statement, Amnesty International, which is part of a campaign called #PayUpFIFA, said that while money paid out already was undoubtedly important, Qatar must expand its existing compensation funds or establish a new one.
It is calling for Fifa to pay $440m towards reparations  matching the prize money it will pay during the World Cup.
On Saturday, Fifa said it remained in positive continuing dialogue with labour organisations and the Qatari authorities over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup.It said there had been a great response to Infantinos letter calling for teams to focus on the football, with various teams backing it."

The DBU said in 2021 that their two training kit sponsors would make way for messages critical of Qatar while also minimising the number of trips to the country to avoid commercial activities promoting the World Cup hosts events.

Qatar has come under intense pressure over its treatment of foreign workers and restrictive social laws, leading many participating teams to raise concerns. The country has denied claims that workers were exploited.
We have today got a message from Fifa that the training shirts our players were to train in, where it would say human rights for all at the stomach [of the shirt], have been rejected due to technical reasons, which is regrettable, Jakob Jensen, the DBU chief executive, told Ritzau news agency.
Fifa declined to comment. Its rules stipulate that any team equipment must not have any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images. We believe the message human rights for all is universal and not a political call, but something everyone can support, Jensen said. Fifa wrote to World Cup teams this month urging them to focus on football in Qatar and not let the sport be dragged into ideological or political issues.
Hummel, the kit manufacturer, said in September it had toned down the details on Denmarks World Cup jerseys and released a black kit as a protest against Qatars human rights record ahead of the tournament. Denmark play their first game of the World Cup against Tunisia in Group D on 22 November."

While the report also documents a number of cases of good practice, including adequate channels for reporting concerns with working conditions, good access to healthcare, satisfactory safety measures and decent living conditions, Equidems findings conclude that Qatar has been a hostile environment for stadium workers.
It claims that many of the workers interviewed for its report faced severe exploitation and were forced to work in a culture of fear and retribution, sustained through nationality-based discrimination and workplace violence, including physical, verbal, and mental abuse.
Equidem also alleges that companies working on stadium construction have actively evaded inspections, quoting a Nepali worker employed at Lusail stadium, which will host the World Cup final, who told researchers that workers were sent back to their camps before a visit from Fifa.
Workers started to hide to get a chance to complain to the Fifa group. Then the company started checking if anyone is still on site. If anyone was caught hiding, they were either sent back home or had their salary deducted, he said in the report.
Unpaid wages, failure to pay for overtime or end-of-service benefits and wages lower than promised were also reported. A Bangladeshi worker employed at a number of stadiums told researchers: I do not get paid for overtime work and I work from 6am to 6pm seven days a week.
In 2014 the local World Cup organising committee established a set of worker welfare standards to protect workers on its projects,including better worker accommodation, mechanisms to file complaints and a scheme to reimburse workers recruitment fees. About £20m has been repaid so far.
In recent years, the Qatari authorities have also introduced a number of labour reforms, chiefly the introduction of a minimum wage and the abolition of the kafala, or sponsorship, system.
However, Equidems report suggests there were significant shortcomings in the implementation of these measures.
The fact that such widespread labour abuse persists on worksites so heavily regulated by Qatar, Fifa and their partners, suggests that the reforms undertaken over the last five years have acted as cover for powerful businesses that seek to exploit migrant workers with impunity, the report said.
The report calls on Fifa to establish a compensation fund for workers who have suffered during the building of the stadiums.
We estimate thousands of workers are owed remedy for illegal recruitment charges, unpaid wages and other harms. Qatar, Fifa and their partners stand to earn billions from this tournament, yet the workers who built the stadiums have had their money stolen and their lives ruined, said Mustafa Qadri, Equidems executive director. Fifa can no longer turn a blind eye and should set up a compensation fund immediately.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Fifa said that measures to safeguard the health and wellbeing of World Cup workers, which include regular independent inspections, occupational health and safety measures on site, comprehensive medical checks and projects to address health and Covid-19, have been an important priority.
The robustness of this programme has been recognised repeatedly by experts and trade unions over the years, reaching the highest international standards in terms of health and safety. We are in contact with our Qatari counterparts to assess the information included in the Equidem report, Fifa said.
In a statement, Qatars supreme committee said that the Equidem report was littered with inaccuracies and misrepresentations which undermined its commitment to ensuring the health, safety and dignity of workers on Fifa World Cup 2022 projects.
Since introducing the workers welfare standards in 2014, our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provisions, and reimbursement of illegal recruitment fees to workers, said a spokesperson. We are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.
The supreme committee is transparent about the challenges and progress, accepting constructive criticism, and maintaining dialogue with key stakeholders. The report, released very shortly before the start of the World Cup, is an egregious attempt to undermine and damage the SCs reputation."

dividend payouts to Qatar investors,"Some of the UKs largest listed companies including water and energy giants have handed almost £500m to Qatari state-owned investors this year, raising concerns that blue-chip company profits are supporting the controversial World Cup host.
The dividend payouts are the result of the Gulf nations investments in a raft of FTSE 100 firms, including Barclays, Shell and utility firm Severn Trent, which have reported strong profits amid a cost of living crisis and the worst UK drought in centuries.
The figures, compiled by the Guardian, cover funds distributed to Qatari state-owned shareholders in the 10 months leading up to the controversial tournament in November.
However, the Qatari states income from UK-listed firms is likely to have been in the billions of pounds since it won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup in 2010.
The figures will raise concerns over how everyday spending by British consumers, through bank transactions, grocery shopping and air travel, may be inadvertently supporting the Qatari host, which has criminalised homosexuality and been accused of exploiting migrant workers to build World Cup infrastructure.
Although the shareholdings of listed companies are publicly available, there is little awareness about the types of investors that hold shares in UK firms.
Amnesty International UKs director of economic affairs, Peter Frankental, said British firms needed to be more upfront about the destination of dividend payouts.
Qatars considerable wealth and its extensive portfolio of overseas investments have been accompanied by the systematic exploitation of its vast migrant labour force, many of whom have toiled for years for abusive employers with the connivance of the Qatari authorities, Frankental said.
UK companies need to be transparent about any human rights abuses that may have occurred in their investor chain, including those originating in Qatars notorious construction sites.
Qatars $450bn (£389bn) sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a huge interest in UK-listed investment in recent decades, spending billions to acquire stakes in a raft of British blue-chip firms such as the London Stock Exchange Group and Royal Dutch Shell.
UK stocks make up nearly a fifth of the QIAs equity portfolio at 17%, and are worth a combined $8.8bn. That makes the UK the third-largest destination for the authoritys equity investments, behind Germany which makes up 29% of the portfolio at a value of $15bn, and Qatar where shares make up nearly 19% of the portfolio at $9.6bn.
Those UK stakes have meant that the investment authority  and therefore the Qatari state  have benefited from British companies profits, which have subsequently been handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.
Guardian analysis of publicly available data shows Qatari vehicles, including QIA, have pocketed around £475m in dividends since January alone, helping support Qatari finances at a time when the state is estimated to have spent about $200bn preparing to host the World Cup.
That includes Shell, which handed nearly $17m worth of dividends to Qatar in a year when it reported record profits on the back of surging energy prices linked to the shortages caused by the war in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the QIA earned £13m through its 4.6% holding in Coventry-based water company Severn Trent, which has come under fire for bumper executive payouts  including £3.9m for its boss Liv Garfield  even though the country suffered under the worst drought conditions in centuries.
The QIA also earned £11m from the London Stock Exchange Group, in which the QIA still holds a 7% stake, and further £33m from its shareholding in supermarket chain Sainsburys.
That is on top of £64m from a 6.3% stake in banking giant Barclays. Its holding in the UK bank is a hangover from its controversial involvement in the banks emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The funding arrangement helped Barclays avoid a public bailout that would have placed it under government control, but later led the Serious Fraud Office to accuse three former Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for the emergency funding. A jury found those executives not guilty in early 2020. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal.
One of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding  a subsidiary of the QIA  a total of $387m (£347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company.

While Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a £50bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani.
Other dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid £382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at £14,000.
The state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group  which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic  has not yet paid a dividend this year.
The QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment.
Sainsburys said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsburys staff.
Reckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. We have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.
Shell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. A commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.
Those dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank.
In December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending £85m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, known as Rolls-Royce SMR.
QInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a 43% stake in stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its first profit in three years in 2021.
Meanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for the Qatar Emiris Naval Force. And amid the UKs energy crisis, Qatars participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus. State-owned Qatar Energy has a 67.5% share in the Pembrokeshire-based terminal.
Qatar is one of the UKs largest sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a role that led Boris Johnson to discuss increased supply from the Gulf state in late 2021, as global gas prices soared.

The countries have made a public request that Fifa step up on two issues it has repeatedly committed to deliver but currently remain unfulfilled: a permanent workers rights centre in Qatar and a compensation fund for migrant workers and their families. It comes days after the Fifa president Gianni Infantino wrote to all World Cup qualifiers asking they put politics to one side and let football take the stage.
In their statement the group acknowledge that Qatar is not alone in having issues and challenges, a point made by Infantino in his letter, and acknowledges that progress has been made. However, the group go on to call for a more conscientious attempt to deliver change on human rights in the country.
We acknowledge, and welcome, as we have done in the past, that significant progress has been made by Qatar, particularly with regards to the rights of migrant workers, with the impact of legislative changes demonstrated in the International Labour Organisations recent reports, the statement reads.
We welcome the assurances given by the Qatari Government and by Fifa regarding the safety, security and inclusion of all fans who travel to the World Cup, including LGBTQ+ fans.
However, embracing diversity and tolerance also means supporting human rights. Human rights are universal and they apply everywhere. We will continue to support the momentum for positive, progressive change and continue to advocate for a conclusive outcome and update on the two key outstanding issues we have been discussing with Fifa for a long time.
Fifa has repeatedly committed to deliver concrete answers on these issues  the compensation fund for migrant workers, and the concept of a migrant workers centre to be created in Doha  and we will continue to press for these to be delivered.
While written in diplomatic language, the statement references Infantinos letter and will be interpreted as a direct broadside against the president of the games ultimate governing body. It also suggests, however, that the group of European countries are short of global allies in their attempts to put pressure on Fifa.
Alongside Mark Bullingham of the FA and Noel Mooney of the Welsh FA, the statement was signed by leaders of footballs governing bodies in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland.

The statement concludes: We believe in the power of football to make further positive and credible contributions to progressive sustainable change in the world.
Qatars foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, described critics of the country as arrogant on Sunday. Asked in a Sky News interview whether players should stay out of politics, he said sports should never be politicised and added: What kind of message are they sending to their own public if they are use criticising and preaching from a distance? What about their own problems within their countries, which they are turning a blind eye and now they want to preach to the world.
Honestly, not me or the Qatari people only but theres a lot of people from around the world who are just seeing this as a sense of arrogance. A sense of people who cannot accept a small country from the Middle East has won the bid to host the World Cup. Thats what its all about."

glass on to the streets of London far below as they celebrated the opening of Britains tallest building, the Shard.
For Johnson, then mayor of London, the unseasonably cold July day in 2012 symbolised Londons resurgence after the devastation of the global financial crisis.
Prince Andrew marked the occasion by abseiling down a section of the 310-metre tower for charity, saying afterwards that he had easily overcome the psychobabble about fear of heights.
But the day was perhaps most auspicious for Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, known colloquially as HBJ. The great steel-and-glass edifice that now loomed over Britains capital had been built with nearly £2bn of Qatari investment.
The building served as a totem for a strategy that he pioneered: Qatar  a British protectorate from 1916 to 1971  was deploying its vast oil-and-gas wealth to buy huge chunks of the nation that once ruled over it.
As an Observer audit now reveals today, the Qataris British property empire has ballooned since then into a sprawling portfolio likely to be worth in excess of £10bn.
The gas-rich state of Qatar has invested much of its vast wealth in the UK. It has more than £40bn of British assets, including stakes in Barclays Bank, Sainsburys, Heathrow and British Airways.
Property has proved particularly attractive. Qatar, or the al-Thani ruling family, holds more than 4,000 land titles, not just in London but spread throughout Britain. They range from luxury mansions and hotels to obscure industrial estates and terraced houses.
Qatari Diar, the emirates property development business, is behind multibillion-pound urban developments in Glasgow, Manchester and Leeds. Its London projects include Chelsea Barracks, the US embassy, Elephant and Castle and Grosvenor Waterside.
The capital is without doubt the nerve centre of Qatars UK empire. The emirate, or members of the al-Thani family, have carved out their own quarter of London, in Mayfair, known as Little Doha.
The Ritz, Claridges, the Savoy, the Connaught, the Berkeley, the Churchill, Grosvenor House Suites and the InterContinental Park Lane - all of these five-star prestige London hotels  worth more than £5bn by some estimates  are wholly or partly Qatari-owned.
Upmarket retail has proved irresistible too. Qatar bought Harrods in 2010 for about £1.5bn. The former emir also owns luxury brands Valentino, Balmain and Pal Zileri, including their salubrious London outlets.
Qatari royals own dozens of multimillion-pound mansions across London, none more jaw-dropping than Forbes House, owned by former prime minister Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ). His planned renovations are expected to turn the property into Londons first £300m home.
Qatar dominates the skyline too. Its sovereign wealth fund paid £1.1bn for HSBC's HQ in 2014, then led a £2.6bn takeover of Canary Wharf Group, which owns the financial hub in Londons Docklands.
No asset symbolises Qatars financial muscle more than the Shard. The emirate financed the £2bn development and owns land around the imposing 310-metre tower too, including the News Building occupied by Rupert Murdoch's News UK.
Qatar and the vast al-Thani clan that rules it have played a real-life game of Monopoly, scooping up trophy assets such as hotels on Mayfair and Park Lane  not to mention properties on Pall Mall, Oxford Street, Bond Street and Vine Street. Prize purchases include ultra-high-end hotels such as the Ritz and Claridges, the international finance hub at Canary Wharf, not to mention luxury personal retreats, including rural idylls and London mansions.
But analysis of more than 4,000 land titles shows that Qatar and the al-Thanis British interests are larger and more diverse than previously thought, also taking in unglamorous industrial estates, modest seaside hotels and terraced houses in Bootle and Runcorn.
The state of Qatar alone, not counting individual royals personal holdings, is the 10th largest landowner in the UK, according to analysts at MSCI Real Assets. The emirate owns nearly 2.1m sq metres (23m sq feet) of property in Britain, more than 1.5 times the area of Londons Hyde Park.
Many of the properties are owned through Jersey, the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman Islands, meaning ownership is often difficult to determine via public disclosures.
When Qatar won the right to host this years World Cup, in December 2010, it was not that years first major coup for the emirate.
Seven months earlier, an investment arm of its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), had paid Egyptian-born billionaire Mohamed Al Fayed more than £1.5bn for the world-famous Harrods department store, including the imposing two-hectare Knightsbridge premises it has occupied since 1849.
Both were victories for HBJ, who was three years into his tenure as prime minister and spearheading a nascent global investment spree. He did so with the blessing of his ally, the then emir, Hamad bin Khalifa (or HBK), who was developing a taste for luxury retail.
In the years that followed, via the Doha-based investment vehicle Mayhoola, HBK spent nearly £1bn buying the European fashion houses Valentino, Balmain and Pal Zileri, including their outlets on Bond Street and Sloane Street.
Even these salubrious addresses pale in comparison with Qatars portfolio of top London hotels.
The Ritz, the Savoy, Claridges, the Connaught, the Berkeley, the Churchill and the InterContinental Park Lane are all either wholly, or partly owned by Qatari royals or  in the case of the Ritz  by the current emirs brother-in-law.
Three, including Claridges, are owned, via two Luxembourg-based entities, by Maybourne Hotel Group, whose ultimate controlling parties are registered at Companies House as HBK and HBJ.
The value of Maybourne is subject to a bitter legal dispute between HBJ and the hotelier Paddy McKillen, who claims the Qataris are wrongfully trying to do him out of his share of an uplift in value created by a £800m renovation he oversaw. Although the Qataris dispute the figure, McKillen argues the Maybourne clutch of hotels, thanks to his work, is worth more than £5bn.
The emir of Qatars brother-in-law paid £700m for the Ritz while the InterContinental was a £400m purchase for Constellation Hotels, ultimately owned by the QIA, in 2013. The value of the state-owned Katara Hospitalitys 50% share in the Savoy  in partnership with Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal  is undisclosed.
The al-Thani clan also owns more than a dozen of the largest and most lavishly appointed homes in London. Observer analysis suggests their combined residential property portfolio is worth at least £1.5bn.
A sizable chunk of that is accounted for by HBJs properties, including a £100m penthouse at the One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge and Forbes House, a six-storey Georgian mansion in Belgravia, which HBJ reportedly paid £150m for in 2018. The former is owned by a company in the Cayman Islands, the latter by a firm in the British Virgin Islands.
HBJ won a key breakthrough in 2020, when he defeated conservationists who opposed his plans to remove a vast double staircase in the mansion. Victory means he can go ahead and install 25 bedrooms, a cinema, a library, a sauna, a Turkish bath and parking for 32 vehicles, potentially turning the house into Londons first £300m property.
Not far away, in Mayfair, is the area known as Little Doha, after the emirates capital, due to its concentration of multimillion-pound Qatari-owned homes and offices.
One of the most celebrated is Dudley House on Park Lane, a 4,000 sq metre palace that Queen Elizabeth II reportedly said made Buckingham Palace look rather dull by comparison.
It was purchased in 2006 through a company called Bristol Isles Ltd, based in the Bahamas, and restored under the discerning eye of its resident, Hamad bin Abdullah al-Thani, a cousin of the emir.
The Pandora Papers leak  shared with the Guardian by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2021  revealed that Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, mother of the current emir and wife to HBK, bought two of Londons most expensive properties, on Cornwall Terrace in north London, for £120m in 2013.
Documents from the leak also suggested that the structure of the purchase, using layers of offshore companies based in tax havens, legitimately reduced stamp duty payable on the mansions by £18.5m.
Those two properties overlook leafy Regents Park but the quiet of the countryside appears to be appealing, too. One member of the family, Mohamed Khalifa al-Thani, has bought four plots of land at a luxury rural development in southern England that has found favour with celebrities.
But that is a relatively rare foray outside the capital for the Qatari royals, who own at least 30 London properties with an individual value of £10m or more, including mansions dotted around Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge.
Their wrought iron railings and beautiful facades are a world away from the gleaming towers of the City and Canary Wharf  but Qatar owns many of those too.
It took almost £2bn of Qatari state cash to build the Shard and the emirate still owns the bulk of the Shard Quarter in London Bridge, including the nearby News Building, occupied by Rupert Murdochs News UK, owner of the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times.
Two years after the towers completion, the QIA aimed high again, buying HSBCs headquarters at 8 Canada Square in Docklands for £1.1bn. It swiftly followed that up by leading a consortium that bought Canary Wharf Group in a £2.6bn takeover. The groups flagship property is One Canada Square, the UKs third-tallest building and a symbol of British high finance. In Tower Hamlets, the borough that includes Canary Wharf, the Qatari state holds 200 land titles, according to MSCI Real Assets.
But thousands of ordinary people, not just in London, unwittingly buy and rent property from Qatar, courtesy of its real estate development business. Qatari Diar, owned by the QIA, is a major partner in a string of massive urban regeneration projects and it jointly owns thousands of land titles as a result.
In London, it has already finished Chelsea Barracks, the US embassy and the Olympic village, and is in the process of transforming Elephant and Castle, with plans afoot for Lewisham Gateway.
It is also behind projects at New Maker Yards in Salford, Merchant City in Glasgow and an area of Leeds that Companies House filings suggest could be named the Holbeck Quarter.
All in all, Land Registry data shows that companies part-owned by Qatari Diar hold 4,000 land titles, including hundreds owned via the British Virgin Islands. Records suggest the titles cost £2bn at the time of purchase but the current value is likely to be significantly higher.
Some Qatari investments in the UK are rather less grand, particularly those owned by lesser-known members of the sprawling al-Thani clan with their own business interests.
More than 20 of the properties identified by the Observer are owned by Earth Creation, a company whose controlling party is one 30-year-old Hamad Saoud al-Thani.
Its latest accounts, for 2020, show that Earth Creations property investments increased in value from £12m to £21m, apparently funded by a loan from Hamad Saoud, whose father was a prominent art collector.
Land Registry records suggest that Hamad Saouds portfolio of UK property includes homes bought in Runcorn, Eccles, Bootle and Liverpool for as little as £65,000.
Earth Creation is registered to an address in Londons Covent Garden that also houses Messery Limited, owned by another family member, Hamad Nasser al-Thani.
This business owns property on industrial estates and business parks in Swindon, Rochdale, Nottingham and Wigan.
And in Bournemouth, one Abdulla Qassim al-Thani owns nine properties including half a dozen hotels. Between them, Land Registry titles suggest, they are worth one twenty-fifth of the Ritz."

Members of the Fan Leader Network, a group which Qatari authorities say contributes to tournament planning through fan insight, research, content creation and message amplification, have been offered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of travelling to the tournament, providing they agree to certain terms and conditions.
A number of England and Wales fans have signed up to the deal, which includes paid-for flights and accommodation but necessitates a minimum 14-day stay and attending selected and scheduled events. One will be the opening ceremony on Sunday 20 November, during which fan leaders will feature in short sections of the TV coverage. Ideally we hope that you will stay for the entire duration of the 29 day tournament, organisers told potential travellers. The Times has reported that 40 England fans and 40 Wales fans have agreed to take up the offer.
According to the terms and conditions of a deal initially revealed by the Dutch broadcaster NOS, travellers will in effect be asked to promote the tournament and the experience as part of the trip. Key to the deal will be the liking and re-sharing third-party posts, while fans have also reportedly been asked to flag social media content that is critical of the event.
The conditions asked of fans are similar to those that might be asked of a social media influencer before undertaking paid promotion. But the terms have not put off some supporters, with fan representatives from all 32 countries expected to accept the offer of free hospitality at a tournament expected to be twice as expensive as the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
With the countdown to the tournament firmly under way, the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, has co-authored a letter with the general secretary, Fatma Samoura, calling on all 32 competing countries to put concerns over the host country to one side and let football take the stage.

Infantino did not address concerns over Qatari human rights, for example, writing instead that while there are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world, football should not be expected to have an answer to every one. He repeated his promise that everyone is welcome [at the World Cup] regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality, a more detailed commitment than that currently made by the hosts."

The England managers remarks were questioned by Human Rights Watch, which said families of migrant workers who had died, been injured, or cheated of their wages had told it they would like to support the World Cup but cannot because their children are starving and their breadwinners died in Qatar.
Amnesty International warned that although many migrant workers in Qatar were football fans, the majority were more interested in having their rights fully protected and being paid properly than in the World Cup.
Southgate made his remarks in an interview with CNN, in which he acknowledged there were ongoing issues with Qatar but said there was no question the World Cup should go ahead.
Ive been out to Qatar several times and Ive met lots of the workers out there and they are united in certainly one thing, thats that they want the tournament to happen, and they want that because they love football, he said. They want the football to come to Qatar.
However Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, suggested such a viewpoint was misplaced.
First, migrant workers in Qatar cannot speak freely because of security concerns, and the FA should know this, she told the Guardian.
Second, has Gareth Southgate and the FA attempted to contact migrant workers and families of those who died from Nepal, India, Kenya or elsewhere? Any family who received a loved one and breadwinner home in a coffin without compensation from Fifa and Qatar cannot cheer the opening of this World Cup.
Southgate does not face any risks speaking to migrant workers, but migrant workers do face risks in speaking to him, including the loss of their jobs and deportation if they say something Qatari officials think is wrong.
There are many migrant workers who are proud of the work they have done to build the World Cup in Qatar. But there are also many who have suffered preventable deaths and harms and until the deaths, loans, injuries and wage theft are compensated, it is not correct to say all migrant workers are united.
The issue of human rights in Qatar remains a concern, despite Fifa and the Qatari organisers claiming that significant reforms have taken place. Last year the Guardian reported that 6,500 migrant workers had died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup 10 years ago. A more recent investigation found that workers employed on World Cup-related projects are having to work 12-hour shifts across 30 days a month to earn the equivalent of about £1 an hour.
In his interview Southgate stressed that the Football Association had been working with human rights groups to help them to seek redress before the tournament kicks off on 20 November. Were trying to support those ideas with compensation for families who have lost workers and a workers rights centre, he said. So were supporting the things weve been asked to support.
However Ella Knight, Amnesty Internationals migrants labour rights researcher, said far more needed to be done by Fifa and football as a whole.
Many workers in Qatar will of course be football fans, but what migrant workers have really stressed to us is the need to have their rights fully protected, to be paid properly, able to change jobs freely and to enjoy safe and dignified working conditions  before, during and after this tournament, she said.
The World Cup is about to take place with vital labour reforms still very much unfinished business, and thousands of workers abuses remaining unaddressed.
The opening game is now less than three weeks away and Fifa is yet to commit to remedying workers and their families for the abuses theyve suffered despite widespread support from the public, FAs, players and World Cup sponsors. We urge the FA to maintain its pressure on Fifa, pushing it to recognise and urgently address the suffering of workers without whom the World Cup simply wouldnt be possible.
The Qatari Supreme Committee, which is responsible for organising the tournament, has insisted there have been improvements. In a statement last month it said: The advancements in workers welfare is a legacy we are very proud of, and one that we are already seeing in action. We have always believed that the World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, leaving a legacy of meaningful and sustainable progress for the country and region."

It is a dictatorship in which women have to seek permission from their male guardians to marry or work in many government jobs, in which being gay is criminalised and can result in a prison sentence, in which migrant workers are treated appallingly and in which journalists have been imprisoned for reporting critically on domestic politics. Yet all of this will inevitably be minimised as the worlds eyes fall on Qatar for the start of the 2022 World Cup next month.
Qatars leaders know this and this is why they have paid through the nose  estimates put it at $220bn (£190bn), by far the most expensive World Cup of all time  to host the competition, including lavishing money on efforts to lobby British politicians, as we report today. And so football teams, international supporters, the worlds media and foreign dignitaries will duly head to Qatar for an international sporting tournament that has serious environmental implications and will, some predict, leave a huge carbon footprint. At a conservative estimate, at least 6,500 migrant workers have lost their lives n Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup in 2011.
This World Cup is just the latest in a long line of expensive international sporting events that have been hosted by nations that stand accused of fundamental human rights breaches. The 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics in China; the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia; the Bahrain Grand Prix; the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar; the 2019 Anthony Joshua fight in Saudi Arabia: there is an indisputable trend of big sporting events being hosted by rich but unsavoury countries.
This is the reflection of a number of trends. There is the push factor of dictatorships around the world seeking to launder their reputations through the medium of international sport  $200bn on a World Cup doesnt just secure international visitors and sporting entertainment but PR that money normally cant buy. This is particularly valuable in an age when Gulf states recognise that at some point the oil and gas will run out and so are looking to build other sources of power on the world stage. In response, competitions are more and more expensive to put on, as democracies that have to justify the expense to voters get priced out of the market. The 2006 World Cup in Germany cost just $4.3bn. The levels of financial corruption in international sport  governing bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee have been notoriously porous to expensive bribes and shady deals in exchange for votes behind the scenes  have made things worse.
All this means that sporting bureaucrats often face unenviable choices, for example, between Beijing in China and Almaty in Kazakhstan for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which ultimately went to the former, necessitating the manufacture of fake snow out of 49m gallons of water.
Sports governing bodies advance the case that awarding competitions to countries with questionable human rights records draws attention and scrutiny to their abuses, encouraging liberalisation. Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, claimed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar that sport can uniquely shine the spotlight on issues and is the best diplomat we have. But there is little academic evidence of these effects. Chinas human rights abuses got worse between the 2009 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics. The same is true of Russia and the 2014 Sochi Olympics. And the 1936 Berlin Olympics were undoubtedly a propaganda coup for the Nazis.
Sporting competitions would lead to improvements only if sports bodies were to take a tough approach with host nations, attaching stringent conditions that improve human rights records beyond the period of the competition itself. But they are not, generally, willing to do this. In fact, they are much more likely to equivocate and protest their neutrality over the most dreadful human rights abuses. Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, when asked what he would say to Chinese Uyghurs forcibly separated from their children and interned in concentration camps, declared on the eve of the 2022 Beijing Olympics: The position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality if we get in the middle of intentions and disputes and confrontations of political powers, then we are putting the Games at risk. Could there be anything more morally decrepit than a policy of neutrality on genocide?
The problem does not start and stop with sport. In truth, the approach the international sports bodies take to countries such as the Gulf states is just a reflection of international politics. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are considered close allies of the UK, with cooperation on security and the fostering of trade links, including arms sales. The RAF even has a joint air force squadron with Qatar; earlier this year Boris Johnson went to Saudi Arabia to meet Mohammed bin Salman despite the fact that his government had arranged for the Saudi journalist Jamal Kashogghi to be murdered in its consulate in Istanbul in 2018. International sporting competitions should not be awarded to governments with appalling human rights records. But this is a line that western political, not just sporting, leadership has proved all too willing to cross.

and trips for British MPs in the past year than any other country, according to Observer analysis that reveals the Gulf states lobbying efforts ahead of next months football World Cup.
The Qatari government made gifts to members of parliament worth £251,208 in the 12 months to October 2022, including luxury hotel stays, business-class flights and tickets to horse-racing events.
The value of Qatars gifts was greater than the amount spent by the 15 other countries whose governments made donations to British MPs combined. And it was more than six times the £37,661 in gifts and hospitality given to MPs by the United Arab Emirates, the second-highest foreign government donor.
The gifts for the past 12 months also far outstripped those from Qatar in any other year for which records are available, revealing how authorities ramped up efforts to charm British MPs ahead of the World Cup. Records show MPs declared about £100,000 worth of gifts and hospitality from Qatar in the five years to October 2021, but more than double that in the last 12 months alone.
Transparency International said it was extremely concerning that MPs were accepting thousands of pounds worth of hospitality from foreign governments with questionable human rights records and that this could leave the door open to undue influence. There is no suggestion that any MP broke rules, however.
The Qatari government failed to respond to repeated requests for comment.
In some cases, MPs who received freebies later appeared to speak favourably about Qatar in parliamentary debates, or to deflect attention away from issues that the authorities have been keen to downplay.
During a debate about preparations for the World Cup earlier this month, Alun Cairns, who chairs an informal parliamentary group set up to foster good relations between the UK and Qatar, made a speech praising Qatar, including paying tribute to its response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.
Cairns, Tory MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, initiated the debate on 20 October and later shared videos of it on Twitter alongside a Nelson Mandela quote: Sport has the power to change the world.
Records show he received £9,323 worth of donations from the Qatari government in 2022, for a five-day trip in February to meet officials alongside other members of the Qatar all-party parliamentary group (APPG), and for a trip a month later to attend the Doha Forum policy event.
The APPGs deputy chair, David Mundell, who accepted hospitality worth £7,473 from Qatar for a trip last October, also contributed to the debate, responding to a concern raised by another MP about LGBTQ rights in Qatar by saying critics should focus their energies on the handling of LGBT issues in professional football in the UK  Rather than simply point out issues that might arise in other countries, we still need to focus on issues at home, he said.
Mundell, who was the first openly gay Conservative cabinet minister, also gave an interview to Qatars state-run agency this year in which he criticised baseless media coverage about a report into Qatars record on worker rights. He did not mention the International Labour Organizations finding that despite milestones being reached on worker rights in Qatar, there were gaps in implementation, nor its past research which found that 50 workers in Qatar lost their lives in 2020 alone, with over 500 severely injured and 37,600 suffering mild to moderate injuries.
Both MPs referred to their declared interests during the parliamentary debate. Mundell did not respond to requests for comment. A statement from the Qatar APPG, provided via Cairns, said the group played an active role in scrutinising all aspects of UK-Qatar relations, including human rights, ethics, education, energy and infrastructure.
Details of Qatars donations were revealed through analysis of declarations in the MPs register of interests. The records show 34 MPs declared 40 donations from Qatar in the year to October 2022. Of those, 22 MPs were Tory, seven were Labour, three were SNP and two were independent.
Most of the money was spent on trips to Qatar for members of the Qatar APPG to meet ministers and government officials.
During two trips, in October 2021 and February 2022, British MPs travelled to Qatar to discuss issues including preparations for the World Cup, workers rights reform and bilateral relations, as well as Qatars humanitarian and political response to the Afghanistan crisis, transparency logs show.
The Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid for the all-inclusive visits, typically spending £7,000 to £8,000 per person for flights, hotels and meals during a seven-day trip.
A source told the Observer that MPs on one trip were put up in luxury hotels with vast swimming pools and travelled business class on Qatar Airways. Some MPs were taken to a camel-racing event and had a private dinner with officials involved in the delivery of the Fifa World Cup.
They said that MPs gave officials two barrels worth over issues, including LGBTQ rights, but that they were slick and charming and their goal was clear: To improve Qatars reputation in the world.
In particular, they wanted to minimise the criticism of their role in the World Cup, the source said. I came back equally critical. Maybe a couple would have been more sympathetic.
The APPG did not comment on the claims that officials were given luxury treatment or say which government officials MPs met with during the trips, but said visits include meetings with a range of ministers and NGOs, including the UN Sponsored International Labour Organization.
Qatars Ministry of Culture and Sports, meanwhile, paid for two MPs to attend the Qatar-sponsored Goodwood festival in Sussex in July, according to the transparency records. The MPs were Sir John Whittingdale OBE, the Conservative MP and former culture secretary, who took a plus one and declared the gift as being worth £1,200, and Nigel Evans, Conservative MP for the Ribble Valley. It was the third donation for Evans from Qatar in nine months. Neither Whittingdale nor Evans responded to requests for comment.
The findings will fuel concerns about attempted backdoor lobbying by foreign governments in the UK. Other countries that have made donations to MPs in the past 12 months include Bahrain, Somaliland, Azerbaijan, San Marino and Kuwait. Lobbying by China and Russia has previously been exposed.
Rose Whiffen, from Transparency International, said too many MPs were showing poor judgment in accepting gifts from overseas administrations. She added that they must seriously consider if it is appropriate to accept these sorts of trips  not just whether they are allowed to. Chris Bryant, Labour MP and chair of the Commons Committee on Standards, has warned that parliament is particularly vulnerable to foreign influence, saying during a debate in December that we ought to be cognisant of the danger that a foreign power might be seeking to lobby  through the back door.
Bryant is one of the MPs who accepted a donation in kind from Qatar in the form of an expenses-paid trip but told parliament in May that he regretted doing so. He has advocated for US-style rules which bar members of Congress from accepting donations and gifts from foreign governments. All visits abroad are paid for by Congress.
Relations between the UK and Qatar have strengthened in recent years. In May, the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced a strategic investment partnership, which will see Qatar invest in key sectors of the UK economy over the next five years, including fintech, life sciences and cybersecurity. Downing Street said the deal would create new UK jobs and was worth up to £10bn.
Days later, the Ministry of Defence announced it would be funding counter-terrorism training for Qatars military ahead of the World Cup. Throughout the tournament, the RAF and Royal Navy will provide air and sea support.
Last week, foreign secretary James Cleverly was criticised after telling gay football fans they should be respectful in Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup.
Speaking on LBCs Nick Ferrari at Breakfast show, he suggested they show a little bit of flex and compromise and be respectful of the host nation. Labour called the comments shockingly tone-deaf."

Australia over human rights implications of World Cup in Qatar,"Ever since the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar by Fifa in 2010, there has been much talk about the human rights implications of the tournament. And for the past two years, the Socceroos  with the support of their union, Professional Footballers Australia  have been undertaking their own fact-finding to better understand the reality of the situation they might be entering if they qualified.
Briefings have been organised with many key bodies: Fifa and the local organising committee, the Supreme Committee for Legacy and Development; Fifpro, the global players union; human rights group Amnesty International; and groups that advocate for workers in Qatar, including the International Trade Union Confederation and Building and Wood Workers International.
But in September, having qualified mid-year in a dramatic shoot-out, the players decided they needed to go straight to the source. With the help of PFA, a briefing was arranged with several migrant workers who have been involved in the A$470bn construction extravaganza needed to prepare a tiny nation of less than three million people for the biggest sporting event in the world.
According to sources present at the briefing, held via Zoom just prior to the Socceroos recent friendlies, it was not a happy conversation. The working conditions are horrendous, alleged one participant.
Despite much talk from Fifa and Qatar authorities about law reform to strengthen labour rights, the migrant workers on whose back the World Cup has been built continue to suffer labour rights violations. Analysis by the Guardian has found that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won hosting rights for the World Cup  many of whom likely worked on projects relating to the tournament. (Qatari officials have said only three workers have died on-site while building stadiums  a claim that has been disputed). Reports alleging workplace injuries, unpaid wages, squalid accommodation conditions and workplace abuse are widespread.
The World Cup is the pinnacle for any player and we know how much qualification means for the nation and the game, Socceroos midfielder Jackson Irvine tells Guardian Australia. Over the past two years we have engaged with human rights groups and migrant workers directly to better understand the situation in Qatar.
A campaign led by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and FairSquare, #PayUpFifa, has been calling on Fifa to establish a fund for workers, to ensure compensation for labour rights abuses. Despite backing for the campaign from the Belgian, French, English, German, Dutch, Welsh and American football assocations, Fifa is yet to agree to the proposal.
We know there has been progress, says Irvine. But we also know that much more needs to be done to fully implement the reforms and the establishment of a migrant workers centre is critical to continued progress.
Concerns about labour standards are just one part of the human rights-based objection to the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar. Political and civil rights are significantly constrained in the authoritarian state, with the hereditary emir holding all executive and legislative authority. Freedom House ranked Qatar not free it in latest assessment, which noted that while Qatari citizens are among the wealthiest in the world, most of the population consists of non-citizens with no political rights, few civil liberties, and limited access to economic opportunity. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and there have been concerns about the treatment of LGBTQI+ visitors to the World Cup.
Fifas decision in 2010 to hand the World Cup hosting rights to Qatar was misguided then and continues to attract justified criticism, says Justine Nolan, a law professor and director of UNSWs Australian Human Rights Institute (AHRI). Fifas more recent adoption of policies that espouse non-discrimination and respect for human rights does not square with Qatars policies and practices that actively discriminate against women, migrant workers and LGBTQ+ peoples.
In its final report on the situation ahead of the World Cup, published last week, Amnesty said that there was still a long way to go in addressing human rights and labour rights issues in Qatar. Despite the positive evolution of Qatars labour system, substantial work remains to effectively implement and enforce these [changes], the report says. Ultimately, human rights abuses persist on a significant scale today.
Last week, legal experts and sporting administrators gathered at a hotel in central Sydney to discuss the growing focus on the human rights implications of sporting mega-events. Convened by the AHRI, the event was made all the more topical by recent collisions between sport and politics in Australian sports, including netball, cricket and Australian rules football. The conference discussed sportswashing, a global phenomenon with significant domestic implications.
In the lead-up to the World Cup some teams are choosing to stand up for rights and yet Football Australia (FA) remains silent, seemingly overlooking the human cost of staging this extravaganza in Qatar, says Nolan, who co-convened the event.

In contrast, many other nations participating in the World Cup have publicly called out the human rights implications of the tournament. The Danish national team will wear a special protest kit; England players will sport a rainbow one love armband (Fifa are yet to approve the design, which will also be worn by several other European teams).
A spokesperson for FA told Guardian Australia that it has been engaged in an ongoing process of education and dialogue to gather information on the situation regarding the preservation of human rights and worker welfare in connection with the hosting of the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022.
The spokesperson acknowledged recent legal reforms in Qatar and said that FA urged companies and organisations working in Qatar to continue the path to reform and ensure the new legislative standards are met. FA has also indicated it has undertaken due diligence in relation to all service providers it will use during the tournament, ensuring they meet the new compliance standards in a socially responsible way.
This scrutiny on FAs own direct impact is expected to continue during the tournament. The players will continue to work with FA to ensure that every measure possible is taken to ensure they do not contribute to harm through their participation at the World Cup and that in the event harm occurs, there is access to effective remedy, says PFA co-chief executive Kathryn Gill, a former Matildas player.
Sources with knowledge of internal dynamics at FA have indicated that its membership of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is a complicating factor. Unlike European football federations, which have limited ongoing engagement with Middle Eastern counterparts, Australian officials and teams are interacting with and playing against Qatari counterparts and neighbouring nations on a regular basis. Speaking up too loudly now could cause political headaches in the future, further ostracising FA within AFC circles.
But that has not stopped the players. Guardian Australia understands that the Socceroos will issue a joint statement ahead of the tournament, highlighting the ongoing labour rights and human rights concerns associated with Qatar 2022. FA, PFA and the players will have more to say before the tournament commences, confirmed the FA spokesperson.
Talking a stand is always a risk but as members of a union we know we have support, says the Socceroos captain, Mat Ryan. We are advocating for the same things we value as players  respect and dignity as a worker. We want to ensure that football is a positive force and that means we need to play our part in ensuring this is the case.
Nor, according to Irvine, will that be the last of it. We all have a role to play and as players we have focused on how we can have an impact, he says. We know that public pressure has helped to facilitate change and the workers have asked us to keep the pressure up. As a country regularly playing in the region we have a responsibility to continue to do this  not just now but after the final whistle of the World Cup."

Five experts give their verdict,"Global criticism of the treatment of hundreds of thousands of workers from countries such as Nepal, India and Bangladesh who have been building Qatars World Cup dream led to the Gulf state introducing a range of labour policy changes that it says have improved the lives of the migrant workforce. Have those changes worked and how likely are they to be sustained after the tournament? A panel of experts give their view.
The World Cup is like a slap in the face of workers.
I have spoken to thousands of them. They dont know their rights; their contracts are violated; there is discriminatory pay, and then theres the weather. People are working in severe temperatures. They get dehydrated. Workers have been dying in their sleep. These deaths may be caused by the work, and their families should be compensated.
At least there is a minimum wage now. Before, there was no way you could complain about your salary, but now you know you should get at least 1,000 rials a month (£245). The problem is that it is too low. Way too low. How many billions of dollars has Qatar spent on preparations for the World Cup? The minimum wage is a drop in the ocean.
Kafala [a systemunder which workers cannot freely change jobs] was abolished for two or three months only. After that, these powerful Qataris who own big companies complained and the changes were watered down. Now there is a requirement to get your company to approve your resignation. This is like bringing the kafala system again through the back door.
The first time I was detained in Qatar was for trying to change my job. I could deal with it because I know my rights, but what about the thousands of workers who dont know their rights? People have been deported just for trying to change companies.
Fifa talks a lot about fair play. Is it really fair play when there is nothing for the workers? Yes, a lot of workers got employment but it was under exploitative conditions. I think a countrys human rights record should be part of the evaluation process when awarding a World Cup. For Fifa, it was an afterthought.
Geoffrey, a Kenyan, worked in Qatar for three and a half years. While there, he also worked for the human rights group Equidem as a researcher and advocate for workers rights. He was detained three times and has now returned home, where he continues his advocacy work
Earlier this year, we commissioned a survey among 1,000 low-wage workers, and found that 86% of respondents felt that the labour reforms had positively affected their lives.
Changes to the kafala system have led to labour mobility. Now workers can negotiate for better conditions, and employers are incentivised to provide them in order to attract and retain talent.
Legislation has also been introduced on the minimum wage, on protecting outdoor workers during the summer months, and on the election of migrant worker representatives within companies.
Over the past five years, the government has engaged closely with the ILO [International Labour Organization], international trade unions, NGOs and others. Notably, staff from the global unions are based with us here in Doha, raising awareness among workers, and helping them to resolve the problems they face.
There is universal acknowledgment that the work is not complete. Among our top priorities, theres the need to address the retaliation by some employers against workers who wish to change jobs; to streamline access to justice and the recovery of due wages; and to ensure that the law protecting domestic workers is fully implemented.
We are all impatient to see the reforms fully applied and enforced, but we also recognise that we are dealing with new laws and new institutions, and changing practices that have been deeply entrenched for decades.
The World Cup was never the finish line, but rather a key milestone in Qatars longer-term strategy, which includes competing for skilled workers in an increasingly global market.
Max Tuñón is the head of the ILO project office in Qatar. The ILO has been working in partnership with the Qatari authorities since 2018 to introduce labour reforms.
The companies I work for are just getting away with everything. There are many people now walking around Qatar who have lost their jobs, havent received their end-of-service benefits or months of salary. Ive seen a lot of good people suffer and its absolutely linked to the World Cup.
Qatar wanted to build everything as cheaply as possible. All the big contractors were fighting one another to win the work. They were winning jobs at any cost. As Qatar started slowing down its construction [before the World Cup], all these contractors then started to face problems  and where they save their money is by not paying suppliers or our salaries and end of services.
All the government and supreme committee [the local body organising the World Cup] want to do is tick boxes, show a good report and just hope and pray that no one finds out.
Ive worked on a number of World Cup projects and we had good workers accommodation and bad workers accommodation. We did all our inspections at the good accommodation. This is how it works.
Theres no accountability. The government doesnt enforce its own laws effectively. They did allow workers to change jobs  but the bad companies were losing all their workers, so the owners went to the government and said, Stop this.
Its 50% the contractors fault and 50% the governments fault. The country is too small for them not to know whats going on.
Once the World Cups finished, thats it. The eyes of the world will no longer be on Qatar. Theyll just go back to how they were.

Qatar has made significant strides in terms of labour reforms in the past five years. In a region hostile to civil society interventions or criticism, Qatar has engaged with its critics. No doubt the World Cup was effective leverage to compel it to do so.
When we speak of reforms, we have two main components  in principle, whats been implemented and, in practice, whats been enforced. Much of our concern is with the latter.
The removal of the no-objection certificate [which workers required from their employer in order to change jobs] was by far the most important of the changes. It gave migrant workers an opportunity to tap into the local job market for better opportunities. For the first few months, the job change process was almost seamless, until employers started pushing back. Other parts of the kafala system, particularly the power of employers to report workers as absconding, were misused to keep workers in check, negating to a large degree the effectiveness of the reforms.
Advocates for Qatar keep arguing  weakly, in my opinion  that cultural change will take longer and what must be appreciated are the changes in law. This is not about culture but selective reforms that still give power to the employer.
The true test, and the real opportunity for meaningful change, will happen after the World Cup. The relentless  and, at times, unfair  scrutiny Qatar has faced in the last 12 years means reforms and reactions have been to primarily ward off criticism, without focusing on buy-in and behavioural change locally. As a result, the powerful business owners cock a snook at the reforms and continue unchecked with their exploitative practices.
Id like to believe Qatar will not regress on its legal commitments post-2022, but if they are to be enforced, it will require dialogue at the grassroots level to show that ensuring the human rights of migrant workers and business profitability is not a zero-sum game.

Qatars two flagship labour reforms are the introduction of a minimum wage and the abolition of the kafala system. The first is a scandal, the second largely a failure.
The minimum wage is the equivalent of about £1 an hour. This is poverty pay, in one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Employers must also provide food and board, or an additional allowance to pay for them. The food allowance is about £2 a day.
The abolition of kafala worked for a few months, but today the system is effectively still in place. On my recent visits to Qatar, almost every worker I spoke to said they were unable to change jobs, leaving them at the mercy of abusive employers.
Both reforms only came into force 10 years after Qatar won the right to host the World Cup, and long after most of the stadiums and infrastructure were completed.
That is not to say nothing has changed, but every claim of reform the Qatari authorities make has to be heavily caveated.
New workers accommodation has been built, but many thousands still live in squalid, overcrowded dorms.
The World Cup organising committee has introduced a scheme to partly reimburse the huge illegal fees workers are forced to pay to secure their jobs, but it only benefits a fraction of Qatars low-wage workforce.
Regulations have been put in place to limit labourers exposure to the searing summer heat, but the authorities have done little to investigate the sudden and unexplained deaths of thousands of workers. Countless families of deceased workers have been left without compensation.
The Qatari authorities and Fifa claim the World Cup will leave a lasting legacy of better workers rights in the country and the region. That seems unlikely. Some of the reforms have stalled even before a ball has been kicked.

In a final pre-tournament report, Amnesty said progress has been made by the Qatari state on the protections afforded migrant workers. But weak regulations and a lack of enforcement means there is still a long way to go, the organisation says. Amnesty calls for a number of actions, including support from Qatar and Fifa for financial compensation for workers.
Despite the positive evolution of Qatars labour system, substantial work remains to effectively implement and enforce these [changes], the report says. Ultimately, human rights abuses persist on a significant scale today.
Among its observations, the report finds that workers in security and domestic labour remain particularly vulnerable to exploitation, with some expected to work up to 18 hours a day without a weekly day off. Furthermore, Amnesty argues, there has been insufficient research into the thousands of deaths of those working in construction in the country over the past decade and the contribution played by extreme heat.
The report also finds vestiges of the abolished kafala system in the country and states wages are still commonly withheld from workers.
Steve Cockburn, Amnestys head of economic and social justice, said: Although Qatar has made important strides on labour rights over the past five years, its abundantly clear that there is a great distance still to go.
With the World Cup looming, the job of protecting migrant workers from exploitation is only half done, while that of compensating those who have suffered abuses has barely started.
Progress must not grind to a halt once the World Cup roadshow leaves Doha. Turning a blind eye to the abuses suffered by thousands of migrant workers over the years flies in the face of their respective international obligations and responsibilities.
Last month, the English Football Association endorsed a compensation scheme for workers and their families involved in building the World Cup infrastructure in Qatar. They were joined by a number of other associations, with the United States Soccer Federation adding its name this week. Fifa and World Cup organisers, however, have yet to confirm their commitment to such a scheme.
Fifa said : Fifa remains in positive ongoing dialogue with the International Labour Organization, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and all relevant authorities in Qatar over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup. Further information will be provided in due course.
The Qatari supreme committee for delivery and legacy said: The advancements in workers welfare is a legacy we are very proud of, and one that we are already seeing in action. We have always believed that the World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, leaving a legacy of meaningful and sustainable progress for the country and region.
Our progress has been recognised by one of the worlds largest trade unions, Building and Wood Workers International (BWI), the UN International Labour Organisation (ILO), and we welcome the recognition by Amnesty International, highlighting that our work has improved the living and working conditions of thousands of migrant workers and that it represents an unprecedented and significant improvement in the living and working conditions.
Work is ongoing and there is of course still room for improvement. We are continuing to explore alongside key partners the opportunities to enhance the legacy that improves the lives of workers and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting reforms."

media,"International television crews in Qatar for the Fifa World Cup could be banned from interviewing people in their own homes as part of sweeping reporting restrictions that could have a severe chilling effect on media coverage.
Broadcasters, such as the BBC and ITV, will effectively be barred from filming at accommodation sites, such as those housing migrant workers, under the terms of filming permits issued by the Qatari government.
According to the terms, recording at government buildings, universities, places of worship and hospitals is also prohibited, along with filming at residential properties and private businesses.
The restrictions are within a list of conditions that outlets must agree to when applying for a filming permit from the Qatari authorities to capture photography and videography of the most popular locations around the country. They also apply to photographers but do not explicitly refer to print journalists who do not film their interviews.
The rules do not prohibit reports on specific subjects, but restricting where crews can film  including but not limited to houses, apartment complexes, accommodation sites  is likely to make it difficult for them to investigate reported abuses, such as the mistreatment of migrant workers, or to conduct interviews on subjects people may be reluctant to discuss in public, such as LGBTQ+ rights.
Last night, Qatars supreme committee denied imposing chilling restrictions on media freedoms and said several regional and international media outlets are based in Qatar, and thousands of journalists report from Qatar freely without interference each year.
It said it had updated an earlier version of its film permit application terms that appeared on its website to relax the rules for broadcasters attending the World Cup, including removing a rule that said they must acknowledge and agree they will not produce reports that may be inappropriate or offensive to the Qatari culture, Islamic principles.
But while the newer rules say filming is allowed across the state of Qatar, they still appear to impose strict restrictions, including that by applying for a permit, broadcasters agree not to capture film/photography at excluded locations. Places where filming is not allowed under the permit are residential properties, private businesses and industrial zones or government, educational, health and religious buildings.
The rules also say that broadcasters must respect the privacy of individuals and not film them or their properties without their express prior approval.
Fifa said it was working with the supreme committee and relevant organisations in Qatar to ensure the best possible working conditions for media attending the tournament, as well as ensuring that broadcasters continue to report freely without any restrictions.
A spokesman said it would be important to clarify that filming on private property in any country remains subject to approval of the owner/operator of the property. He did not comment on why the terms include an outright ban on filming on private property.
Journalists have previously been detained in Qatar for reporting on issues deemed contentious by the authorities. In 2015, a group of BBC reporters was arrested in Doha and spent two nights in prison while investigating housing conditions for migrant workers. Last November, two Norwegian journalists investigating conditions for migrant labourers working on World Cup venues were arrested and detained for 36 hours as they tried to leave the country.
James Lynch, from FairSquare, a London-based human rights group, said the rules were an extraordinarily sweeping range of restrictions that would make it difficult for TV crews to pursue non-football related stories. He said: It would be incredibly difficult to fully comply with these terms, if even filming near to private or government property violates the terms of a permit.
This is likely to have a severe chilling effect on free expression. How many organisations will authorise reporting on Qatars social issues if to do so puts them at risk of ending up in court?
The restrictions present an ethical dilemma for broadcasters.
The BBC and ITVs stringent editorial guidelines promote impartiality and are designed to protect against undue influence, including from governments. BBC guidelines, which apply to all content, say broadcasts should not unnecessarily offend but stress the importance of free expression.

Jemimah Steinfeld, editor-in-chief at Index on Censorship, said the film permit conditions were a definite cause for concern and appeared to be purposely ambiguous so that broadcasters would err on the side of caution.
She said her gut feeling was she felt they should not agree to such terms but said it was extremely difficult terrain to navigate. The question is whether there might be stories that they can still do within the realms of that agreement, and is it more important that they do those stories? she said. If the BBC is basically being shoved into a position where all they can cover is the glory of it, then that would be a bad outcome.
Qatar is an Islamic country with an authoritarian system of government. Swearing, public displays of affection and dressing immodestly are seen as offensive. Homosexual behaviour is illegal. Posting material that appears to insult, slander or is culturally insensitive may also be considered a crime, according to travel advice from the UK government.
In recent months, Qatar appears to have softened its stance on several issues in an attempt to convince visitors that it is safe and tolerant. It is allowing the sale of alcohol at stadiums, for instance, and has said that gay fans will be able to display affection during the World Cup. It has not eased rules restricting freedom of speech, which include a law against spreading fake news online.
The BBC did not say if it had agreed to or challenged the film permit rules. A spokeswoman said it had a proven record of addressing topical issues as part of our coverage. This World Cup will be no different.
ITV said its news and current affairs team had carried out extensive reporting of the decision to award the tournament to Qatar and the questions surrounding the host nations human rights record and will continue to do so.
Our journalism will be robustly independent. ITVs World Cup tournament coverage will focus on the football, but will not shy away from the controversies off the pitch, a spokesman said
This article was amended on 15 October 2022 to include a response from the Qatari authorities received after publication. An earlier version reported on the terms of the filming permit published on the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 website, including that it said media must agree not to produce reports that may be inappropriate or offensive to the Qatari culture, Islamic principles. However, the supreme committee told the Observer this document related to the draw stage and had since been revised. The article was amended to reflect this, and to remove reference to the geographical locations covered by the permit as originally seen. That filming permit was deleted from the tournament website shortly after this article was published."

Cup","As the World Cup approaches, Qatar is going to need at least 10,000 litres of water every day for each of its stadium pitches. Based in a region with virtually no access to fresh water, it is going to rely on desalination  the practice of debrining saltwater so it is drinkable.
It seems like an elegant solution  but the problem is that desalination, which is projected to boom by 37% across the Gulf region in the next five years, has huge environmental costs, in terms of the fossils fuels used to carry out the process, and the marine environment. But without it, how can the arid region possibly quench its thirst?
Forty-three per cent of the worlds desalination capacity comes from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Despite the scarcity of water, the GCC are among the highest consumers of it in the world, and heavily dependent on desalination plants.
The United Arab Emirates has one of the highest per capita water consumption rates in the world, with people using roughly 500 litres a day  50% above the global average.
Yet many GCC countries such as the UAE are still keen to promote water-rich lifestyles through desalination efforts. Manicured lawns and waterparks are commonplace across cities, and at the Dubai fountain show, every half hour throughout the day more than 83,000 litres of water shoot up as high as a 50-storey building.
But with populations rising, the regions water industry is facing increasing pressure. These plants essentially have rivers running through them. If you look at the desalination capacity across the GCC as a whole, the volume of water flowing through that is about four times the amount of water flowing down the Thames, says Will Le Quesne, the Middle East programme director for the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.
Maryam Rashed Al Shehhi, an assistant professor of civil infrastructure and environmental engineering at Khalifa University in the UAE, says: Desalination is our main source of fresh water. Its a very arid region, and annual rainfall has decreased. So its very scary to think about any other sources of water.
Since the 1950s the GCC have been at the vanguard of desalination. The southern coasts of the Gulf are dotted with more than 300 desalination plants  mostly in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain.
Powering the worlds greatest concentration of desalination requires a significant amount of energy. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, makes up a fifth of the worlds output, with roughly 30 desalination plants burning through 300,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
In fact, most desalination plants are oil or gas powered, operating with either thermal processing technology, which collects steam from boiling water and condenses it, or the more modern reverse osmosis technology, which relies heavily on electricity produced using natural gas to power pumps that force water through very fine membranes, essentially straining out the salts in the water.
Either way, you need quite a lot of energy. That can be derived from a lot of sources including by burning fossil fuels, says Le Quesne.
So although Qatar maintains the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, climate organisations are already expressing doubts. The water demands alone are eye-watering. The tournament will need to manage pitches across eight stadiums, and more than 130 additional training grounds. The delicate and complicated process of creating the right turf for football in the Qatar climate just as the weather begins to cool means the groundsmen have to mimic winter, expert Haitham Al Shareef told Reuters, blowing chilled air over the grass and watering the pitch with at least 10,000 litres of desalinated water.
And for emergencies, a 425,000 sq metre reserve of grass  some 40 soccer pitches worth  is growing at a farm north of Doha. The water consumption of that patch is not recorded.
And despite national commitments to reducing carbon emissions and meeting net zero targets, the region is expecting to do more desalination, not less, with capacity planned to expand 37% by 2027.
This could be devastating for the Gulfs marine ecosystem, says Le Quesne. Desalination is one of the worst marine pollution drivers around the world, producing brine, a highly saline waste fluid usually released into the sea as saltier, toxic and warmer seawater. It can contain chemicals such as chlorine, heavy metals, and anti-foaming agents that are added during the desalination process, which can harm coral reefs and smaller marine organisms that live on the seabed.
Along with water, smaller organisms also risk getting sucked into the system and can get impinged, crashing into the screens of the intake pipes, or entrained, travelling with water reaching the plant, resulting in severe injury and death.

The microscopic plants of the sea, things like fish eggs, will all get drawn into the system and experience very high levels of mortality. Most of them are typically destroyed on their way through the system, says Le Quesne.
With growing environmental concerns, GCC countries including the UAE and Oman are exploring methods involving solar energy.
By far the most ambitious plan is Saudi Arabias solar dome, the worlds first zero-brine discharge desalination plant. Announced in 2020, the project is now being prototyped as part of Neom, the outlandish $500bn (£447bn) planned megacity.
Partnering with a London-based company, Solar Water, the 20-metre high dome made from glass and steel is proposed to be surrounded by mirrors that will collect sunlight to heat up the seawater, condense it in a separate chamber, and distill it into fresh water.
The dome itself will be illuminated by this strong sunlight. Itll look like a sparkling jewel in the desert, says Christopher Sansom, a professor of concentrating solar power at the University of Derby and a director at Solar Water.
But although the solar dome will, the designers say, be cheaper to build and operate than conventional plants, it will also produce significantly less water.
Though Saudi Arabia has no shortage of sunlight, solar-powered desalination can have its limitations, says Sansom. Any interference with clouds or wind can stop the power from being generated. Dust is another factor that can hinder the technology. In a desert environment such as Saudi Arabia, solar panels need to be wiped clean.
While promising, Al Shehhi says desalination plants running completely with solar energy is not yet practical and more research is needed into implementing more renewable energy into the desalination process.
Its a challenge. The amount of water pumped every day from the Gulf to be desalinated is huge, she says. And that is before a World Cup is added into the equation.
This article was amended on 10 October 2022. An earlier version referred incorrectly to 144 pitches across eight stadiums. The headline was also changed to more accurately reflect that the Qatar World Cup is part of the water strain issues affecting the Gulf region, rather than the sole cause of it."

The colour of mourning, the kit manufacturer Hummel said in a post on Instagram releasing the black third-choice design. While we support the Danish national team all the way, this shouldnt be confused with support for a tournament that has cost thousands of people their lives.
The designs seem to complete a promise made last November by the Danish football federation [DBU] to wear clothing with critical messages at the tournament.
Though Fifas World Cup rules prohibit political statements on team uniform, the three Denmark shirt designs in all-red, all-white and all-black appear to comply, with no words or symbols that are an explicit statement. The national team badge, Hummel logo and decorative white chevrons  a famous feature of the Denmark shirt since the 1980s  are faded into the same single colour as the shirt, but remain visible.
We support the Danish national team all the way, but that isnt the same as supporting Qatar as a host nation, Hummel said.
Qatars World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy [SC], later disputed Hummels claim that the tournament has cost thousands of people their lives.
We have engaged in robust and transparent dialogue with the DBU. This dialogue resulted in a better understanding of the progress made, the challenges faced, and the legacy we will deliver beyond 2022, a SC spokesperson told Reuters.
We wholeheartedly reject the trivialising our genuine commitment to protect the health and safety of the 30,000 workers who built Fifa World Cup stadiums and other tournament projects. That same commitment now extends to 150,000 workers across various tournament services and 40,000 workers in the hospitality sector.
Qatar has accepted its labour system is a work in progress, but denied a 2021 Amnesty report that thousands of migrant workers were still being exploited. The Gulf state has been fiercely criticised in the past decade for its treatment of migrant workers, mostly from south Asia, who have built tens of billions of pounds worth of infrastructure for the World Cup.

Denmark, ranked No 10 in Fifas world rankings, and who reached the European Championship semi-finals last year, have been seen as one of the 32 World Cup teams most likely to take a strong stance against Qatar. The Danish FA also joined a European campaign launched last week for captains to wear heart-shaped, multi-coloured OneLove armbands in World Cup games.
Danish officials have also taken a leading role in a group of European football federations visiting Qatar to monitor the progress of promised reforms in labour laws.
Denmark have been drawn in a group with defending champions France, Australia and Tunisia. The match schedule for the tournament lists Denmark as the home team with first choice of colour only for its opening game on 22 November against Tunisia, who normally play in white."

The deployment of conscripts, some of whom would normally defer national service because their work is considered vital, highlights the logistical challenge faced by the tiny Gulf Arab state hosting one of the worlds biggest sports tournaments.
The conscripts are training to manage stadium security queues, frisk fans and detect contraband such as alcohol, drugs or weapons concealed in ponytails, jacket linings or even false bellies, according to training materials seen by Reuters.
Qatar has a population of 2.8 million  of whom barely 380,000 are Qatari nationals  and expects an unprecedented influx of 1.2 million visitors for the tournament. It already has an agreement with Turkey, which is supplying 3,000 riot police.
In early September, the civilians were ordered to report for pre-dawn duty at the national service camp north of the Qatari capital, Doha, according to order papers seen by Reuters, less than three months before the 29-day tournament kicks off.
The civilians were told they had been called up to assist with the World Cup and that it was their patriotic duty to do so, the source said. Most people are there because they have to be  they dont want to get in trouble, the source said.
Some volunteers are also training alongside the conscripted force, according to the source, who has direct knowledge of the plan and the training.
Asked for comment, a Qatari government official said in a statement that Qatars national service programme would continue as normal during the World Cup.
Recruits will provide additional support during the tournament as part of the regular programme, just as they do every year at major public events, such as the national day celebrations, the statement added.
Since 2014, Qatari men aged between 18 and 35 have trained with the military for at least four months as part of mandatory national service introduced by the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Dodging the duty can mean a year in prison and a fine of 50,000 Qatari rials (£13,000).
The current group of civilians were on four months of paid leave from their jobs at key Qatari institutions such as the state-owned QatarEnergy and the foreign ministry, the source said. The diplomats are expected to return to their posts after the World Cup.
Conscripts reported to the national service camp five days a week, where they attended training sessions conducted by officials from the security division of Qatars World Cup organisers, the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, the source said.
They were taught to approach fans with positive body language, focus and a smile, the source said, to abide by the universal declaration of human rights, and avoid discriminating against fans on any basis, the source said.
Training also includes hour-long marching drills on the parade ground.
The 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, built for the final, had its first near-capacity crowd earlier this month. Fans leaving the stadium queued for hours for the metro and organisers ran out of water at half-time on a hot late-summer Gulf evening."

Being sent home,"In a dusty car park, near to one of the largest labour camps in Qatar, Worker A gets into my car. I will call him Worker A, not because I do not want to reveal his name, but because I do not know his name.
He only agrees to talk to me after I show him my name on the articles I have written and match it to my passport. I hand over my phone to prove I am not recording anything.
The reason he is reluctant to talk, he tells me, is that his employer had recently used a spy to root out troublemaking employees. Everyone is afraid to speak out but were dying inside, he says.
He claims they work 12-hour shifts for six days a week, but do not receive the legal rate for overtime pay. In all, he says, they earn the equivalent of about £335 a month. Our manager has a [nice car] but on my salary I couldnt even afford to buy its four tyres. Im earning peanuts, says Worker A.
In their labour camp, he alleges, six workers share a room, which is also illegal, and the food is so bad that he says dogs wouldnt eat it.
He tells me about a co-worker, a young man who recently collapsed and died at his workplace, after saying he was feeling unwell but being ordered to work regardless.
Another source sent me a photo of the deceased worker. When I first met her, I asked if I could add her number to my phone so we could keep in touch. She told me to wait because her boss might be watching. A few minutes later, she discreetly slipped me a note with her number on it.
On a recent reporting trip I met up with another worker I had kept in touch with for years. Someone saw us talking and a few days later he was summoned by the police and interrogated.
This is how we report on the buildup to the worlds greatest football tournament: through secret meetings in car parks and messages that can be set to disappear within five minutes. Every sentence I write is carefully constructed so that I do not reveal anything that would put someone at risk.
What are these workers afraid of? Being sent home. Because for all the problems they face, the brutal truth is that they need the work  and they need to pay off the debts they took on to get the work.
When the pandemic began, one worker told me everyone was terrified, but not of Covid. Most of us borrowed money to come here. If we were sent home, how could we repay our debts? Were afraid to return empty-handed, he said.
When they see you are trying to fight for your rights, they find any little excuse to send you home, said another.
That fear even extends beyond Qatars borders. This week I was filming interviews with Nepali workers who had been sent home from Qatar recently, as companies wrap up construction projects on the eve of the World Cup. They had been promised two years of work, but had barely been in Qatar for six months and were struggling to repay their debts.
They agreed to talk, but at the end of each interview they said they feared being barred from getting another job in Qatar if they spoke out.
Every time workers tell me of the problems they have faced in Qatar, I ask: will you go back? And the answer is almost always yes, because they have so few other options. A day of manual labour in Nepal can earn as little as 400 rupees (£2.75), and so even Qatars paltry minimum wage, equivalent to about £8 a day, appears attractive.
Under Qatari employment law, foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract.
The Qatari government also said a fund to support workers, including by reimbursing unpaid wages or benefits, had paid out £152.5m by last month.
Qatar  and all the other Gulf states  could tell a compelling story about how it has created opportunities and alleviated poverty for millions. And to an extent is has. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Qatar has also exploited that poverty, and the desperation of so many, to build the infrastructure for their nation and the World Cup.
I pay school fees for three boys [back home]. They are my life, Worker A tells me. Thats why Im here. If I go home now, my kids will starve.
And so, for many like him, the only thing worse than being in Qatar is not being in Qatar.

In some cases, workers say they have been sent back before the end of their contracts or without receiving their full salary or allowances.
The moves to send migrant workers back to their home countries before the beginning of the Fifa tournament appears to be linked to a government circular, published last year and seen by the Guardian, which ordered some contractors to complete all works by mid-September and prepare a plan for workers leave that maximises the reduction in the number of workers in the country in the run-up to the World Cup.
On the sweeping promenade that skirts the bay in Doha, a red clock in the shape of Qatars World Cup logo counts down the days until the tournament begins.
When the Guardian visited in the summer, hundreds of migrant workers dressed in blue overalls were working in the stifling humidity to complete a revamp of a popular walkway and the road alongside it, known as the Corniche, which is expected to be a destination for thousands of tourists and football fans once the tournament begins.
The Guardian interviewed 25 labourers employed on the Corniche. Most said they had expected to be in Qatar for two years but were being sent home far sooner  in some cases after just 10 months. Many of those interviewed have now returned to their own countries.
Some workers who spoke to the Guardian said they had not been working long enough to repay the huge sums  equivalent to four or five months basic salary in Qatar  that they borrowed to pay recruitment agents in their home countries to secure their jobs in Qatar.
We dont want to go back. Were poor so we need to work, said a Nepali worker, who said he had been forced to pay the equivalent of almost £1,000 in illegal recruitment fees to secure the job. I have not yet paid back the fees. I will be in loss if Im sent back.
Others were in a state of confusion, saying they were being sent home but had been told they may be recalled after the World Cup. They are now facing up to six months with no salary while they wait to see if they will be able to return.
All the workers interviewed said they had no choice but to leave. Many have already been sent and others are on the list. If your name is on the list, you have to go, said one.
Many blamed the World Cup for the sudden end to their work. Everyone will be sent back because of the World Cup. It doesnt matter how long you have been here, said one. What can I do? Im helpless.
Ansar Ali* said he paid an agent in India 100,000 rupees (£1,050) to secure his job. To afford the fee, he borrowed money at a steep 10% interest rate, but calculated that over two years he could repay the debt and still earn enough to support his wife and two sons.
But only 10 months after arriving in Qatar, he was now expecting to be sent home at any moment. I dont know when Ill be sent, but I know Ill have to go. Two or three of my friends have already been notified, he said.
How will I survive when I go back? How will I pay back my debt? he asked as he walked to a currency exchange to swap Qatari riyals for Indian rupees.
The workers interviewed by the Guardian are employed by UrbaCon Trading & Contracting Company (UCC) and InfraRoad, both subsidiaries of UCC Holding, on a project to upgrade the Corniche.
Most of the affected workers appear to have been hired on short-term project visas, but say they were told they would be employed for at least two years. Letters from InfraRoad offering workers jobs in August 2021  after the government circular was published  appear to back this up.
The letters promise annual leave and a return air ticket after two years, and require a two-month notice period after two or more years of service.
Some workers blamed recruitment agents in their home countries for falsely promising them a two-year contract. Others said the responsibility lay with the contractor. Its the companys fault because they made the agreement with the agent, says one.
Research by migrant-rights.org, an organisation that advocates for the rights of migrant workers in the Gulf, uncovered similar cases among workers recently sent back to Nepal by a number of Qatars biggest construction companies.
Some workers told migrant-rights.org that they had not received their full salaries, overtime pay or end-of-service benefits. Others said they had been sent home before the end of their contracts.
One, who had worked in Qatar for 12 years, including on a number of World Cup stadiums, said: How nice it would be for the workers like me to watch the games at the stadiums we ourselves made. But who cares about us? Theres no value for labourers in that country. I feel like the World Cup is an event of and for only rich people.
May Romanos, Gulf researcher at Amnesty International, said: It is crucial for the Qatari government to put workers rights at the forefront of any decisions and ensure that the very people who made Qatars dream to host this World Cup possible do not face further abuses and violations as a result.
In a statement, a Qatari official said there was no government requirement for companies to repatriate employees or reduce their workforce before the World Cup.
Any independent measures by companies to reduce their workforce must be taken in accordance with the law and must not adversely impact the wellbeing of employees, it said.
The statement also said employment law allowed employers and employees to terminate a contract before the end of its term as long as they adhered to the legal notice period. Foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract, it said.
The Qatari government also said a fund to support workers, including by reimbursing unpaid wages or benefits, had paid out £152.5m by last month.
Qatar is committed to a fair and effective labour system, and we value the indispensable role of foreign workers in our economy and wider society, the official added.

When David Beckham and Gary Neville visited recently, their initial reaction was less than enthusiastic.Who chose this? was Nevilles blunt assessment, as they stood in front of the Souq Al Wakra hotels modest entrance.
But what the hotel lacks in glamour it makes up for in privacy. High walls enclose the venue, which is built in the traditional style of the souk that surrounds it. Rooms are arranged around small courtyards to preserve guests privacy. There are few externally facing windows; the only view of the beach is from a rooftop seating area.
Once inside, Beckham was more upbeat. The thing that you look for is tranquillity more than anything. You want to be in the middle of nowhere, he said as he strolled through the hotels grounds. This is the perfect set-up.
The beachfront has the feel of a rundown English seaside town, only hotter. As the heat eases in the evening, families come to swim in the sea or take a camel ride along the beach.
Back inside, the staff appear excited at the prospect of hosting top footballers. Do you know the England team will be staying here? Theyve booked the whole hotel. David Beckham came  I served him, an Indian waiter says eagerly.
Theres no alcohol allowed. We are a dry hotel, he adds, suggesting privacy is not the only reason the England manager, Gareth Southgate, favours the hotel.
For footballers used to outrageous luxury, it is a modest choice, more four-star than five. The standard rooms are small; there are few facilities, limited eating options and no swimming pool (not that December is swimming season in Qatar). Rooms are available from about £70 a night.
While 24 of the tournaments 32 teams will be based within 10km of each other in Doha, Englands hotel is in Al Wakrah, a small town about 25 minutes drive south of the capital. Beyond the beach and souk, there is little to see or do, but in a country as small as Qatar, nothing is very far away.
Englands designated training ground is a few minutes from the hotel. Al Bayt Stadium, where England could play most of their games, is the farthest away of the eight stadiums, but is still less than an hours drive away.
Sitting in the hotels main courtyard, with fountains gurgling in the background, Beckham  who has reportedly signed a multimillion-pound deal to promote Qatar  told Neville what an incredible experience the World Cup would be. This is going to be a tournament that youre not going to want to miss.
However, while the England team may be able to escape the frenzy of fans in their beach-side hideaway, they will not be able to avoid the shadow of labour abuses that will fall on this World Cup.
In the souk outside and along the beachfront promenade, security guards from places including Kenya, Nepal and Pakistan endure 12-hour shifts for just over £1 an hour. They say they work 30 days a month. If I take a day off, they cut my salary, says one.
They say they have all been forced to pay extortionate fees  of up to £1,360  to agents in their home countries to secure their jobs, meaning they have to work for months just to repay the costs.
Recent reforms to Qatars labour laws  touted by Fifas president, Gianni Infantino  should mean they are free to change jobs and look for something better, but the workers who spoke to the Guardian say it is impossible.
The company will not give us permission to leave. They tell us we have to cancel our visas, go home and then apply for another job, says one.
Near the hotel, a Kenyan security guard, in the middle of another 12-hour shift, has a different take from Beckham. He explains that his salary is far lower than he was promised when he left home.
Its a trap, because you are told one thing in Kenya and another in Qatar, he says. Theres nothing you can do. Just keep quiet and get on with it.
Under Qatari employment law, foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract.
The Qatari government also said a fund to support workers, including by reimbursing unpaid wages or benefits, had paid out £152.5m by last month.

Calls for the England team and its governing body to endorse a legacy project have been growing in recent weeks, with NGOs and the international players union, Fifpro, calling for support on two central ideas  financial remedy for workers and their families and the creation of a permanent workers centre in Qatar.
The context of Qatar is not straightforward for many and varied reasons, said Hewitt, who took over as FA chair this year. Ive been to Qatar three times and I would say that if theres a positive to come from a World Cup then it is the opportunity to give migrant workers their voice and thats the way they see it, having sat down and spoken with them.
That responsibility comes back to a legacy and theres a lot of talk before the [tournament] on where we can unite with other federations. I do think thats important  where its united we will stand  to leave a legacy behind that shines a light on the issues, put in place some solutions, and that can overall be a positive thing.
The FAs chief executive, Mark Bullingham, is to meet representatives of other qualified World Cup countries next week to discuss the legacy issue and the possibility of players relaying a symbolic message during the tournament. The Guardian understands that discussions on the financial remedy and the workers centre will be part of the agenda. We would hope to be able to give an update after weve spoken to the players in the wake of that workshop, Bullingham said.
Hewitt also endorsed Gareth Southgate, who will lead England at the World Cup. The England manager was booed and mocked by supporters after the 4-0 home defeat against Hungary last week and while Hewitt acknowledges the team have experienced a stumble she praised Southgates qualities as a leader and defended the decision to extend his contract last year.
He is the most successful England manager weve had for 55 years. Hes taken us to a World Cup semi-final and a Euros final. But the bit people dont see as much is the Gareth at camp and the culture hes created. Certainly, prior to Gareth being the manager of England there was not the pride of wearing the England shirt. There were the club rivalries wed read about. The players not getting on. Hes changed that beyond recognition and Ive seen that first-hand.
I dont just work in football, I work in business and Ive worked with a lot of chief executives and Gareths skills  his high IQ and high EQ [emotional intelligence]  would make him a chief exec in any sphere. That resilience and accountability are the two qualities I admire most about him. He takes [responsibility], he doesnt huff, hes resilient and thats what you want in an England manager.
Hewitt confirmed she spoke to Southgate after the Hungary match and he responded by accepting he had things to learn from the loss. His openness to learn is quite remarkable and quite unusual in any sphere, she said, adding that the contract extension, which runs until December 2024, was a red herring, because I dont think we would be discussing it had we not had the recent series of games  clearly we did that with proper discussion and thought.
Hewitt added: That theres been a stumble does not make us automatically say: Should we have given him a contract? We have confidence in Gareth for all the reasons I described and thats the important thing. And its particularly important going into the biggest tournament."

Organisers have claimed that the 32-team showpiece will be the first carbon neutral World Cup, meaning any emissions would be limited and offset. However Carbon Market Watch (CMW), a not-for-profit organisation which works closely with the European Union, has examined the organisers plans and says projected emissions have likely been underreported, with the footprint created from building seven new stadiums of particular concern.
It would be great to see the climate impact of Fifa World Cups being drastically reduced but the carbon neutrality claim that is being made is simply not credible, said Gilles Dufrasne of CMW, author of the analysis. Despite a lack of transparency, the evidence suggests that the emissions from this World Cup will be considerably higher than expected by the organisers, and the carbon credits being purchased to offset these emissions are unlikely to have a sufficiently positive impact on the climate.
Central to CMWs complaint is its calculation that carbon emissions created by the new stadiums could be as much as eight times higher than the figures contained in Qatars analysis. The CMW report claims the hosts have made a calculation which spreads a stadiums carbon footprint over its entire lifetime, something the report describes as problematic.
These stadiums have been constructed specifically for the World Cup, CMW said. Future extensive use of so many stadiums in such a small geographical space is uncertain, especially when considered against the fact that Doha had only one major stadium before it was awarded the World Cup.
Further criticisms related to plans to absorb emissions with a large-scale tree and turf nursery. The CMW report claims this idea is not credible because any absorption is unlikely to be permanent in these artificial and vulnerable green spaces. It also questions the carbon credit system Qatar plans to use to offset remaining emissions at the end of the event.
The new format, known as the Global Carbon Council (GCC), was originally authorised by Qatari authorities and has different criteria to other established credit systems. It is being used in relation to only two other projects worldwide and has sold 130,000 credits. A minimum of 1.8 million are expected to be sold to the World Cup.
A spokesperson for Qatars Supreme Committee, responsible for the delivery of the World Cup, said the countrys commitment to a carbon-neutral World Cup should be recognised, rather than criticised and that the CMW criticisms were speculative and inaccurate.
It said that many trees from the nursery were endemic to the region, drought tolerant and would be replanted around stadium areas after the tournament. The GCC credit system, it said, was approved by a number of bodies, including the International Civilian Aviation Organisation, a UN agency.
Fifa disputes the CMW analysis, saying it is not appropriate to calculate stadium emissions based only on their use at the World Cup and that detailed legacy plans and business models for stadiums use after the tournament are in place.
The organisers have pledged to measure, mitigate and offset all Fifa World Cup 2022 greenhouse gas emissions, while advancing low-carbon solutions in Qatar and the region, a spokesperson said. Thus, at no point has Fifa misled its stakeholders, as is claimed by the report.
Fifa is fully aware of the risks that mega-events pose on the economy, the natural environment and on people and communities. [It] has been making efforts to tackle those impacts and use opportunities that arise to mitigate the negative impacts and maximise the positive impacts of its iconic tournament."

England and Gareth Southgate have been asked to support the initiative, described as an innovative scheme that would provide some real redress for workers, as attempts to leave a positive legacy for the tournament come into focus six months before the opening World Cup fixture in Doha.
Amnesty International, alongside Human Rights Watch, Football Supporters Europe and the trade union the Building and Wood Workers International are among those calling for a remediation scheme that would address the documented failings of human rights protections which have scarred the history of Qatars World Cup.
According to the organisations, Fifa should reserve an amount not less than the $440m prize money offered to teams participating in the World Cup, to be invested in funds to support remediation. This would represent just a small percentage of Fifas anticipated $6bn revenues from the tournament and the $1.6bn it holds in reserves.
This amount reflects a likely floor for the scale of harm suffered. The final amount required for remedy will be determined by the scale of the need, the harms to be redressed and reparation measures to be offered, should be decided through a participatory process and subject to an independent evaluation.
Sacha Deshmukh, the CEO of Amnesty International UK, called on England to support the idea. We hope the FA and Gareth Southgate and the players will back this innovative scheme, he said. International football can easily afford to do the right thing here. This is a comparatively small share of Fifas enormous prize money pot  and it would provide some real redress for the serious human rights violations that underpin this tournament.
Fifa, in response, said it was assessing the proposals. It said it had put in place an unprecedented due diligence process in relation to the protection of workers and  alongside the Qatari Supreme Committee responsible for tournament  had devised its own remediation processes. This includes $22.6m transferred to workers by the end of 2021 to redress the particular issue of recruitment fees often paid by migrant workers to agencies or brokers to secure employment.
Qatari authorities reacted angrily to the proposal. The ministry of labour said Qatar is proud of the reforms it has introduced and that progress in labour reforms was irrefutable. It said £110m of payments previously owed to migrant workers had been distributed via the governments Workers Support and Insurance Fund.
During this decade-long process we have engaged openly with NGOs that have been consistently critical of Qatar, a statement from the ministry said. The new report undermines much of the goodwill that has been generated.

Amnesty Internationals 74-page report on the welfare of those employed in the sector, They Think That Were Machines, alleges abusive practices including overworking, lack of rest days, punitive fines and racial discrimination, which the organisation claims amount to forced labour.
Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty Internationals head of economic and social justice, said: With the World Cup just months away, Fifa must focus on doing more to prevent abuses in the inherently perilous private security sector or see the tournament further marred by abuse.
More broadly, Fifa must also use its leverage to pressure Qatar to better implement its reforms and enforce its laws. Time is fast running out  if better practices are not established now, abuses will continue long after fans have gone home.
The study interviewed 34 migrant workers employed by eight private security companies providing services for sites including government ministries and football stadiums, as well as other infrastructure projects essential for the World Cup, such as hotels, transport systems and sports facilities, between April 2021 and February 2022. At least three of the companies provided security for recent Fifa tournaments.
IFifa said it does not accept any abuse of workers by companies involved in the preparation and delivery of the World Cup.
Following inspections during the Club World Cup and Arab Cup, contractors that failed to comply with the required standards were identified and the issues found addressed on the spot.
The World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), said: Unfortunately, three companies were found to be non-compliant across a number of areas during the 2020 Club World Cup and 2021 Arab Cup. These violations were completely unacceptable and led to a range of measures being enforced.
The SC added that it has been committed to protecting the health, safety and security of any worker engaged on official World Cup projects.
Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Uganda, Kenya, Bangladesh and Pakistan, flocked to Qatar after it was awarded the 2022 World Cup finals, with official figures in mid-2021 estimating the total at 2.1 million and rising.
Despite government intervention to address the kafala system, which, among other things, prevented workers from changing jobs without their employers consent, and to increase the minimum wage for all, the Amnesty report details ongoing issues.
Interviewees, whose identities have been protected, reported in some cases being made to work 84-hour weeks when Qatari employment law imposes a maximum of 60, with others forced to complete 16-hour double-shifts. Legislation guarantees a minimum monthly wage of 1,000 Riyals (about £210), which equates to an hourly rate of £1.01 for a 48-hour, six-day week.
But 29 of those interviewed claimed to have regularly worked 12-hour days and 28 said they were routinely denied a weekly rest day  one Bangladeshi security guard reported he had not had a day off in three years  with some employers not paying the required rate for overtime and prohibitive reductions or even deportation for failure to comply.
One worker said he had been fined 500 Riyals  half his basic monthly wage  for not tucking in his shirt properly after using the bathroom. In addition, some of those who spoke to Amnesty reported living in sub-standard accommodation and claimed that alleged racial discrimination was rife with differing rates of pay for different nationalities and those from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia often enduring the harshest conditions.
Amnesty, which began its research in 2017, confirmed the Qatari government and Fifa, in tandem with the SC, had moved to improve conditions for workers, but urged all parties to do more.
Cockburn said: Employers are still exploiting their workers in plain sight and the Qatari authorities must take urgent measures to protect workers and hold abusers accountable. Many of the security guards we spoke to knew their employers were breaking the law, but felt powerless to challenge them.
Physically and emotionally exhausted, workers kept reporting for duty under threat of financial penalties  or worse, contract termination or deportation. Despite the progress Qatar has made in recent years, our research suggests that abuses in the private security sector  which will be increasingly in demand during the World Cup  remain systematic and structural.
Qatars Ministry of Labour said Amnestys report selectively highlights a small number of cases where violations persist and ignores the positive impact of Qatars reforms across the whole population.
Qatar has taken immediate action to remedy individual cases of wrongdoing, but these cases do not represent an underlying fault with the robust labour system now in place.
The prevalence of rule-breaking companies has and will continue to decline as enforcement measures take hold and compliance increases among employers. Qatar has repeatedly said that systemic reform is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company takes time."

They will talk of its vast, gas?fuelled wealth and the $500m (£380m) a week it was at one stage spending on new stadiums, transport links and infrastructure.
But despite the billions spent, Qatars World Cup infrastructure has been built on the cheap. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been forced to pay for their own recruitment and labour for years earning poverty wages.
In villages and towns across South Asia and parts of Africa, young men desperate for work sign up with recruitment agents who, often in collusion with companies or brokers in Qatar, illegally extract huge sums from them in return for a job.
It can take a low-wage worker from Bangladesh a year of hard labour just to recoup the fees.
For some the bargain eventually pays off; money is sent home, houses are rebuilt, children sent to better schools and marriage dowries paid. Many workers return to Qatar multiple times, a sign perhaps of a lack of opportunities at home, but also that migration can work.
But for many others, its a trap. They find themselves deep in debt, unable to change jobs and on very low wages.
In 2014 I met a worker building the Al Janoub stadium who was earning overtime pay of 45p an hour. In 2016, Amnesty International found scores of workers maintaining the green spaces around the Khalifa stadium earning a basic salary of about 50p an hour. Two years later, the Guardian interviewed a worker at Al Rayyan stadium earning about 60p an hour. And last year I met dozens of workers employed at Fifa-endorsed hotels, earning a basic wage of £1.25 an hour or less.
When the case of low wages at Al Janoub stadium was reported, the local organising committee said it was working with the contractor to rectify any non-compliance. At Al Rayyan, the committee said it had rectified the case.
These are not just a handful of extreme examples. When Qatar introduced a basic minimum wage the equivalent of £1 an hour last year, the UNs International Labour Organization said that more than 400,000 workers would benefit. In other words, close to half a million workers were earning less than that at the time.
That is assuming they get paid at all. Wage theft appears rife in Qatar: we reported on accounts from some of the men who built the offices used by the World Cup organising committee, as well as some of those who have worked on World Cup stadiums. Last month Human Rights Watch highlighted another case involving workers who had not been paid for up to five months.
The Qataris point to labour reforms, announced in 2020, as a sign that things are changing. They also cite the abolition of the much-criticised kafala system, which barred workers from changing jobs, and the introduction of a minimum wage.
Narad Nath Bharadwaj, Nepals former ambassador to Qatar, told me that conditions for workers in Qatar are better than in other Gulf states but described the reforms as symbolic. He particularly criticised workers wages, saying they receive far less than in other countries with similar levels of affluence. Its a dire situation when workers are exploited, paid paltry wages, made to work eight to 10 hours a day in the inclement climate, he said.
Symbolic or not, reforms are not enough. According to the UNs Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, when business-related human rights abuses occur, states must take appropriate steps to ensure  those affected have access to effective remedy.
The local World Cup organising committee has taken an important step in that direction by requiring companies with stadium contracts to partly repay the recruitment fees of workers. But these men only ever made up a small fraction of Qatars migrant workforce. Hundreds of thousands more have no prospect of repayment.
Even in death, migrant workers often pay their own way. Families of workers who died have told me that the only help they got from Qatar came from their loved ones co-workers, who gave up their own money to send a donation, often to help with costly funeral rituals.
The Qatari authorities and Fifa talk a lot about the positive legacy of the World Cup. The local organising committee said: This tournament is a powerful catalyst for delivering a sustainable human and social legacy ahead of, during and beyond the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
But a real legacy would be to help ensure compensation for those who have suffered: men like Tilak Bishwakarma. Nine years ago, I met Tilak as he cremated the body of his son, Ganesh, on the banks of a river near his home in western Nepal. Ganesh had died in Qatar just months after arriving.
When I got in touch with him recently, Tilak said the family had received no compensation from his employer. In fact, his sons death meant they had no way to pay back the loan they took out to pay for his job.
My heart cries whenever I think about him, he said. It was my fate to cremate my son, while it should have been the other way round. Nothing hurts a father more than cremating his son.
A spokesperson for the Qatar government said: There are complex challenges that need to be overcome to protect economic migrants globally, including in Europe. For its part, Qatar is committed to eradicating illegal recruitment practices in its labour market and supporting efforts to tackle abuse and exploitation throughout the global economy.
The spokesperson highlighted a number of initiatives the government has taken to address the payment of recruitment fees, including setting up recruitment centres in major labour-sending countries.
Companies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident, the spokesperson added."

In a tightly managed set-piece event in Doha before Fridays World Cup draw, Lise Klavenesss address upset the consensus when she said Fifa must act as a role model and called on the organisation to do more to support the families of migrant workers who had been killed and those injured working on the World Cup project.
Our game can inspire dreams and break down barriers but as leaders we must do it right and to the highest standards, said Klaveness, a former Norway international. We cannot ignore the calls for change and how Fifa runs the game has so much to say for how the game is perceived. Fifa must act as a role model.
In 2010 World Cups were awarded by Fifa in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality and democracy  the core interests of football  were not in the starting XI.. These basic rights were pressured on to the field as substitutes, mainly by outside voices. Fifa has addressed these issues but there is still a long way to go.
Klaveness went on to call for specific reforms. Migrant workers injured or families of those who died in the buildup to the World Cup must be cared for.
The Norwegian FA presidents speech was followed by an unexpected address from the general secretary of the Honduran FA, José Ernesto Mejía, who said it was not the right forum or the right moment to make such remarks.
The secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), Hassan al-Thawadi, then gave a passionate address defending the steps Qatar has taken since winning the right to host the World Cup. He said the country had undertaken 12 years of continuous work  dedicated to ensuring this tournament leaves truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies to be remembered. We are acutely aware of the spotlight that comes with hosting the greatest show on earth and we have embraced it.
Thawadi said that the most important legacy of the World Cup would be to correct prejudices that saw the Arab world as a place of conflict. He said he also wanted to reassure those concerned over a social legacy, citing the positive reports made by international trade unions over the development of workers rights. Our adversaries have become allies, he said [and] even our harshest critics such as Amnesty recognise our commitment.
He also criticised Klaveness for not speaking to the SC individually about Norwegian concerns. On [the issue of a] social legacy, I would like to assure the Norwegian FA, he said. [But] Id like to express a disappointment. Madame president visited our country and did not request a meeting. She did not attempt a dialogue before addressing Congress today. We have always been open for dialogue, we always welcomed constructive criticism. We have always had the doors open for anybody who wants to understand the issues, who wants to educate themselves before passing any judgment.
The Guardian understands that Klaveness has addressed Thawadi personally over the social legacy in Qatar.
There was also controversy over a moment later in the Congress when Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, presented a video documenting the progress made on workers and human rights in Qatar since it won the World Cup.
The video said that the SC was instrumental in ending the kafala system in the country and featured the general secretary of the Building and Woodworkers International, Ambet Yuson, praising improvements in worker safety. The health and safety standards in the stadium construction sites are at the same level as the health and safety standards in Europe, Yuson said.
The video also showed Piara Powar, chief executive of the Fare network which campaigns for equality in football, talking about dialogue over the safety of LGBTQ+ supporters in Qatar, where homosexuality remains illegal. Although Powar is quoted as being positive about the process, the Guardian understands that he also expressed concerns over a continued lack of guarantees over supporter safety, remarks not in the video.
On Thursday 16 organisations focused on LGBTIQ+ rights called for the SC to act on supporter safety, saying that action has been slow and that reassurances about the safety of LGBTIQ+ people and the mechanisms in place to ensure safety have not been adequate. The organisations said they had submitted eight requests for action to Fifa and the SC, but had yet to receive any response from the latter.
Infantino announced he was to run for a second four-year term as president."

Notable among them was the claim that the migrant workers whom the FA had met during several trips to Qatar, as well as the NGOs on the ground, were unanimous that they want the World Cup to go ahead in Qatar.
According to Bullingham, who said the FA would brief Gareth Southgate and his players on the situation before Saturdays match with Switzerland, the top request of workers and NGOs is that the FA keep having regular visits there  shine a light on the country and help drive positive change.
The FA is right to visit and consult with the organisations the Qatari government allows to have a presence there, but a few meetings with a handful of migrant workers is hardly the basis for a prevalence claim. The week before Bullinghams comments, a coalition of NGOs, including the groups who have conducted the overwhelming majority of the independent research on migrant workers rights in Qatar, provided a detailed briefing to the FA and painted a far less rosy picture.
Human Rights Watch, for example, told of an ongoing case in which workers for a company with multiple ongoing projects related to the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 had not been paid for five months. FairSquare, who I represented at the meeting, and Amnesty International were also seriously concerned about the lack of progress on labour reforms.
Southgate and his players creditable stance on the issue of racial justice has led commentators such as Rod Liddle, Julia Hartley-Brewer and Tim Montgomerie to make accusations of hypocrisy over a failure to protest about human rights in Qatar. Thankfully, Englands impressive group of young players either arent aware or arent bothered by such sneering and have expressed a willingness to take on the issue.
One of the incredible things that has come out of this group is that people try and make a difference all the time, Conor Coady has said. That is constantly happening in this squad, people trying to use their platform to make a difference. The FA should be showing them the way. Heres how it can do that.
There are a broad range of very serious problems in Qatar and multiple actors with different views on the reform process. Football associations and teams who want to make a difference should make simple calls on issues where there is no room for the type of debate that will leave them unsure of their footing. And there is one issue where none of the organisations working on this issue would disagree.
Qatar 2022 has led to tremendous harm and suffering for many migrant workers and families whose loved ones never returned. Now everything is shattered, the wife of a 34-year-old Nepalese man who died in Qatar from unspecified causes in 2020 told Amnesty International. She has been left to raise two young children alone.
Since becoming a widow, I get 2,000 rupees [US$16] monthly from the [Nepali] government. Sometimes when I get a job, I go to work on roads, farm and drainage. It is the only way to meet the familys needs.
There have been thousands of deaths of young men like this in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup, significantly more than half of them unexplained. No answer for families. No closure. No remedy for their loss.
Sign up to our new womens football newsletter
To that can be added millions of dollars of wage theft that have left workers and their families from some of the worlds poorest countries indebted and destitute. A very large pile of newspaper articles and chunky reports are testament that all this happened in the course of the colossal construction programme Qatar had to push through to be ready for the World Cup.
The football associations whose teams will participate in Qatar 2022 stand to make millions from doing so. That should jar with peoples basic sense of justice when it is set in the context of such tragedy and loss. The FA can step up and show the way for other football associations by publicly supporting calls for compensation and remedy for migrant workers and their families.
This advice was relayed very clearly to the FA in our meeting. If Southgate and his players choose to add their support, that would lend significant momentum to calls that could transform many thousands of lives for the better.

Abdullah Ibhais, a former media manager, was last year given a three-year sentence for misappropriating state funds  a charge that he insists was concocted as punishment for him criticising the handling of a migrant workers strike.
Now Ibhais faces the prospect of a new lawsuit, and possibly a further prison sentence, relating to a bank loan that he can no longer service because money owed to him at the end of his employment was not paid. Ibhais and his family claim that withholding funds amounts to applying financial pressure, as he continues to claim his imprisonment stemmed from his views on the treatment of migrant labourers.
The case has attracted widespread international attention since Ibhais, a Jordanian national, was found guilty of corruption last August. It has also shone a fresh light on the conditions faced by workers who have built Qatars World Cup stadiums over the past six years. Ibhais lost an appeal against his conviction in December and has continued to protest his innocence.
A Qatari judge claimed Ibhais received a bribe when offering a tender for a social media contract. However, no evidence was submitted to the court that found him guilty. The evidence supporting his conviction was a confession made by Ibhais, which he has since retracted.
Qatari officials deny any political element to the verdict and claim due process was followed in the trial and that more evidence exists that has been tabled in court.
Documents obtained by the Dutch newspaper NRC show that the governing body of the 2022 World Cup, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, wrote to Ibhais when he was fired in June 2020 claiming that his termination benefits would be paid. His family told the newspaper that is yet to happen.
They punished him because he did not want to cover up the misery of migrant workers, said his brother, Ziyad Ibhais. Ten months earlier, Ibhais had been asked to add his weight to the claim that a strike by 5,000 migrant workers over unpaid salaries was not related to World Cup preparations. However, he demurred, and refused mounting pressure throughout the day to make a statement putting distance between organisers and the strike.
He was arrested three months later and taken to a criminal investigation headquarters. Despite attempts to overhaul safety and labour conditions for the workforce that has prepared Qatars stadiums, human rights organisations say a raft of legislative changes are yet to lead to tangible improvements. Around 90% of Qatars population of 2.6 million is made up of foreigners, many of them labourers who have toiled for more than five years, often in blistering heat, to finish the stadiums and supporting infrastructure in time for the World Cup that starts on 21 November."

The decision to jail Abdullah Ibhais, a former senior World Cup 2022 media manager, for three years has sparked fierce condemnation from human rights groups, who say that he was coerced into a confession  and a counter-claim from the authorities.
Human Rights Watch and FairSquare say there is no evidence of wrongdoing on Ibhaiss part and have also repeatedly criticised Fifa for its unwillingness to intervene in his case, saying it has enabled the Qatari authorities.
However Qatar insists Ibhais, who has been on hunger strike for 31 days, was jailed for soliciting bribes and not for speaking out against the Supreme Committee, which is responsible for organising the 2022 World Cup.
Speaking after the verdict, Nicholas McGeehan, co-director of FairSquare, who has spent years investigating human rights in Qatar, said the decision raised serious concerns.
This case goes to the heart of the serious issues with Qatars World Cup and every day Abdullah Ibhais remains in jail more people will know his name, know what he did for the migrant workers who built Qatars World Cup, and know the price he has apparently paid for that, he said.
Did he get a fair trial? Absolutely not. Did Fifa make a call for a fair trial? No, they didnt, which I think is pretty scandalous, he added. It was Qatars World Cup organisers who instigated this prosecution, but it was Fifas silence that enabled todays verdict, for which there is no evidence other than a forced confession.
Qatars authorities insist that Ibhais, who was removed from his role in 2019, was sentenced on fraud charges relating to a contract to produce social media content for the 2022 World Cup.
A Qatari official said: The court of appeal has upheld its guilty verdict in the case of Mr Abdullah Ibhais. He was convicted following the careful examination of an abundance of strong and credible evidence against him for soliciting bribes to influence the outcome of a state-funded procurement process. This evidence included extensive details of the crime  much more than the defendants own confession.
A statement from the Supreme Committee said that Ibhais received his full salary from the date of his suspension in November 2019 until August 2020, when he was made redundant along with numerous others as part of a budget restructuring exercise.
It also claimed that Ibhais had reapplied to work for it in March 2021 via a third-party agency.
Ibhaiss post-conviction allegations that the SC conspired against him because of his views on migrant workers are ludicrous, defamatory, and absolutely false, it said. The SCs work culture promotes and encourages staff raising issues and grievances, and particularly on the subject in question (worker welfare).
However human rights groups insist that the Qataris have not been able to present any evidence of wrongdoing against Ibhais.
In contrast, Abdullah claims that he took a stance on workers rights internally, he has got evidence to support that, said McGeehan. He provided us with a very clear explanation of what happened in this case, before it went public, and all of that has been borne out by the documentation that we have subsequently seen.
We have seen the courts judgment. We have seen the fact that the judge refused to investigate Abdullahs allegations of a coerced confession. So when you compare the evidence presented by the Supreme Committee and the Qatari authorities on one hand, which is essentially none, and the evidence by Abullah, of which there is plenty. It leaves the Qataris and Supreme Committee with serious questions to answer.
A Fifa spokesperson did not respond to questions about its lack of an intervention in the case. However in a statement footballs governing body said: Any person deserves a trial that is fair, where due process is observed and respected.
Fifa has been following the case involving Mr Ibhais and notes the statements from the government communications office in Qatar and the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy in relation to the courts decision, it added. Fifa will consider todays ruling before making any further comment."

Gijs de Jong has pledged that the Netherlands team will make the case for a better future in Qatar during the tournament next November and December, including symbolic acts such as visiting migrant worker camps. But as well as protecting improvements already agreed on workers rights, football should push for broader human rights change, De Jong said.
As a legacy, of course we would want it guaranteed that the legislation and reforms agreed in the past few years would be permanent and implemented fully across the whole country, he said. Thats on kafala, on heat protocols, on minimum wage. It would be even better if the work centre introduced by the BWI [Building and Woodworkers International] was made permanent.
The joint committees [between workers and employers] would be great. But it would be even more great if we made a first step on equality between men and women and also on the LGBT discussions.
Concern over exploitation of migrant workers has dominated the years leading up to the World Cup, with the Qatari government eventually instituting reforms. Whereas a recent Amnesty report suggested implementation of the laws had been undermined by complacency, LGBT rights in Qatar have been subject to less scrutiny.
Qatari authorities have assured travelling LGBT supporters that they will be able to feel safe in the country, and rainbow flag livery will be allowed at stadiums. But instigating  sodomy is still illegal under article 296 of the countrys penal code. Womens rights have also received less focus, but a Human Rights Watch report this spring argued that the countrys male guardianship system denies women the right to make many key decisions about their lives.
De Jong said initial discussions regarding LGBT rights had taken place with the Qatari Supreme Committee for delivery of the World Cup, as part of inspections taken by the Uefa working group on Qatar of which the English FA is also a member.
When we were there last time  the focus was on workers rights but we also had a session with the national human rights committee. It was just one session of one and a half hours, so lets not make that an example for everything, but we discussed some sensitive issues openly. Fifa have promised of course to allow the rainbow signs, the flags in the stadia, but we would like a little bit more.
The Dutch national team, alongside the KNVB, has developed a strategic response to the World Cup under the banner football supports change, with the message appearing on the teams shirts before a qualifying match in March. De Jong says the country has been engaged in a response since 2015, when it lobbied Fifa to introduce human rights considerations in assessing World Cup bids, but that this response has stepped up since last year in dialogues with Amnesty International, the International Labour Organization, and the BWI, as well as with Fifa and the Supreme Committee.
De Jong says the country will engage in symbolic action during the World Cup to show our commitment to change.
Were still thinking and discussing with people what the best way will be to attract attention for this, he said. We could go to a good example [of a migrant worker camp], focus on that and show how you can organise the rights of migrant workers in a good way. That could be an option, but you get through in different kind of ways.
We are positive people in the Netherlands mostly. We believe in the future and we want to show what the future can look like. So were probably more tended to work to a positive than a negative example, but it can be different ways. We want to find a symbolic action which shows our commitment. Symbolic for some people sounds cynical, that were doing it for whitewashing or something like that, but thats not what were looking for. We want to do something together with BWI and ILO to show a better future."

The warning comes from Human Rights Watch and FairSquare, who have written to Fifa for a second time to say they believe Ibhaiss confession was coerced and that he has been singled out because of his support for migrant workers in Qatar.
Ibhais, who held the position of deputy communications director for the Supreme Committee before being removed from the role in 2019, was sentenced to five years on fraud charges relating to a contract to produce social media content for the 2022 World Cup.
However, Human Rights Watch and Fair Square say Ibhais alleges he was told by public prosecutors either you sign a confession here or we send you to state security, where they know how to get a confession out of you.
The letter to Fifa also says: It bears repeating that the only evidence presented in court against Mr Ibhais was this confession.
Nick McGeehan, a director of FairSquare, said Ibhais has retracted his confession and is appealing against his sentence. Increasingly it appears that Abdullah Ibhais is in jail because of suspicion and paranoia, not any evidence of wrongdoing, he said.
It is probable he will remain there until Fifa accepts a basic level of responsibility for his wellbeing and demands that he gets the fair trial he deserves.
Human Rights Watch and FairSquare first wrote to Fifa on 4 October, noting that Ibhais believes it was his internal criticism of the Supreme Committees handling of a strike by migrant workers in August 2019 that led to his prosecution and conviction.
That, though, is disputed by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy. In a statement last month it said: Abdullah Ibhaiss claim that he was targeted for taking a position on a labour-related matter is a fabrication and a lie.
The allegations presented by Ibhais have no credibility. The case against Ibhais is rooted in evidence [of alleged manipulation and misuse of state funds], and has absolutely nothing to do with personal opinions or actions on labour-related matters.
A Fifa spokesperson told the Guardian: The letter from FairSquare was acknowledged and a reply sent on 19 November saying that efforts aimed at ensuring Mr Ibhais receives a fair trial are ongoing, and that Fifa has taken note of their recommendations in that respect. Please also note that Fifa has said any person deserves a trial that is fair and where due process is observed and respected. In the case of Mr Ibhais, we will continue to follow this matter closely.
Human rights groups believe that is not nearly good enough, given the severity of the punishment Ibhais faces and the influence they have on the Qataris with 11 months to go before the 2022 World Cup.
If Fifa refuses to step in and advocate for Ibhais to receive a fair trial not based on a coerced confession, it appears that its human rights policy isnt worth the paper its written on, said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch."

The club say the third kit has been created in collaboration with Amnesty International and is the worlds first to feature a QR code which will take those who scan it to a page featuring detailed information on conditions in Qatar.
Tromsø were the first professional club to speak out against the inhumane conditions in the country, read a statement on the clubs website. We hoped Fifa and Qatar would listen but obviously money still trumps human rights and human lives. How many human rights violations will it take before the football community unites to demand better protection for migrant workers?
The kit is being promoted by Malcolm Bidali, a former migrant worker and labour activist who was arrested in Qatar for writing an online blog about the brutal conditions he faced there. Bidali speaks at length in a video on Tromsøs website about his experience of being detained and interrogated in Qatar and the power imbalance that he believes exists between employer and employee for migrant workers in the Gulf state.
Its innovative and will raise awareness about the things that are happening in Qatar, he said. Its a brilliant, brilliant move.
Tromsø started the discussion about Qatar in Norway by suggesting that teams should boycott the tournament. In March Norways players wore T-shirts bearing the slogan Human rights  on and off the pitch before a World Cup qualifier against Gibraltar.
In promoting the kit the club said, We must never look the other way when some use our beautiful game to overshadow human rights violations. We can change this together. Stop sportswashing. Keep the game clean.
Last year Qatar passed into law reforms that were said largely to bring an end to the kafala  or sponsorship  system, under which workers are unable to change jobs without their employers permission. However, human rights groups said the measures did not go far enough and some migrant workers were still earning as little as £1 an hour. The government of Qatar has consistently rejected Amnestys assertion that labour reforms have not translated into changes on the ground for migrant workers."

Ibhais was seized by Qatari authorities last month and returned to jail while he awaits the outcome of an appeal against charges of bribery and a prison sentence of five years.
The former deputy communications director in Qatars World Cup Supreme Committee has been denied communications since his arrest, according to his family. On Thursday, however, a voice note apparently recorded in his cell was published by the Dutch newspaper NRC with an audibly weakened Ibhais discussing his resolve to pursue his hunger strike until I am proven innocent.
In the note Ibhais said: Ive gone on a hunger strike because for me this was the last resort after I was denied the chance to a fair trial.
I was denied the chance to be heard, I was denied the chance to speak up and after all I was detained whilst my trial has not finished yet. I was detained just to make sure that I dont speak up, that I do not talk, that I do not defend myself, that I do not reveal the true story behind what happened to me.
It is hard, it is very hard, and it is weakening, but this is my last resort and I am going to go through with it until I am proven innocent. Because this is how things are, I am innocent and I have done nothing wrong.
Ibhais was found guilty and sentenced in April in a trial over accusations he had taken payments to influence the awarding of a contract to deliver social media for the World Cup. The Jordanian national signed a confession which he later recanted and he denies the claims.
In an interview published with the Norwegian magazine Josimar, Ibhais said the confession had been extracted under duress, that he had not been given access to a lawyer and that the charges had been brought after he raised concerns over striking migrant workers in the country. Days after giving the interview, Ibhais  who had been released pending an appeal  was detained again. The process of his appeal began on 23 November.
In a statement released to the Guardian two weeks ago the Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said: Abdullah Ibhaiss claim that he was targeted for taking a position on a labour-related matter is a fabrication and a lie.
The allegations presented by Ibhais have no credibility. The case against Ibhais is rooted in evidence [of alleged manipulation and misuse of state funds], and has absolutely nothing to do with personal opinions or actions on labour-related matters."

The VG newspaper reported that Halvor Ekeland, a sports journalist for the public broadcaster NRK, and Lokman Ghorbani, an NRK cameraman, were picked up by police late on Sunday as they were preparing to leave for Doha airport.
Hours earlier, during a live broadcast for the Sportsrevyen news show on conditions for labourers working on World Cup venues, Ekeland had told viewers there were stark contrasts, with some workers doing awfully.
Asked during the broadcast what had struck him most strongly, he said: The encounters we had with workers, those who did not wish to speak with journalists on camera. When I asked them for an interview, you see the fear in their eyes.
The journalists said they were arrested outside the hotel and taken to a police station, where they remained until they were released on Tuesday morning. They are now back in Oslo. A spokesperson for the Qatari government said they were detained for trespassing on private property and filming without a permit.
We were questioned, but first and foremost we are happy to be back in Europe, Ekeland told the newspaper. Weve had a hard time. We will have a number of meetings with NRK and find out a number of things, then comment more.
The public broadcasters managing director, Thor Gjermund Eriksen, said NRK had not been informed of the reasons for the detention, which he considered an attack on freedom of the press and free speech. It is unacceptable for the media to be prevented from practising free and independent journalism at one of the worlds largest sport events, Eriksen said in a statement. We will be discussing how this should be handled with Fifa.
Ekeland and Ghorbani had been in Qatar since 14 November and were due to meet Abdullah Ibhais, the former communications director for the 2022 World Cup organisers, who has since publicly criticised the Qatari regime. However, Ibhais, who is appealing against a five-year prison sentence for corruption, was arrested hours before the planned interview.
A spokesperson for the Qatari government said: An NRK crew were taken into custody in the early hours of 22 November for trespassing on private property and filming without a permit. The authorities arrested the crew in their hotel after responding to a complaint made by the owner of the private property on which the crew had illegally accessed. The crew were released without charge early on 23 November after completing the necessary legal procedures. The Norwegian embassy and NRK executives were updated on the situation as it progressed.
The Norwegian football magazine Josimar last month published an extensive article on Ibhaiss trial, arguing that he had been convicted largely to protect the reputation of the Qatari regime after criticising the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar.
The magazine later received a letter from a law firm representing the organising committee alleging the article was defamatory and in violation of several laws, and demanding the removal of WhatsApp messages and voicemail from the piece."

It was the beginning of nearly 10 years of reporting by the Guardian into the often brutal conditions faced by hundreds of thousands of migrant workers tasked with building Qatars state-of-the-art stadiums, as well as the roads, hotels and infrastructure needed to host the biggest sporting event on Earth.
With a year to go until the tournament kicks off, Pattisson considers what has really changed for Qatars migrant workers, while David Conn asks what the most controversial World Cup in history will tell us about shifting global influence, power and wealth.
A summer of record-breaking heat in Canadas Pacific north-west has been followed by devastating floods, exacerbated in part by the impacts of global heating. Salmaan Farooqui and Ashifa Kassam report from British Columbia, a province battered by extremes of weather on the frontline of the climate crisis.
Could Donald Trump and the Republicans be planning an American coup in 2024?

The impact of Qatars reforms is best highlighted through its numbers: over 240,000 workers have successfully changed jobs since barriers were removed in September 2020; more than 400,000 have directly benefited from the new minimum wage; improvements to the wage protection system now protect 96% of eligible workers from wage abuse; and hundreds of thousands of workers have left Qatar and returned without permission from their employer since exit permits were abolished.
Enforcement too has been strengthened to safeguard workers and prosecute companies that violate the law. Again, the numbers tell the story: 35,280 accommodation and worksite inspections were carried out in the first half of 2021, and 13,724 penalties issued to violating companies.
Systemic reform is a long-term process, and shifting the behaviour of every company takes time. Through its actions, the government is sending a strong message to companies that violations will not be tolerated.
Not a single story from among the thousands of people who have benefited from Qatars labour reforms is highlighted in the article. Qatar has never shied away from acknowledging that its labour system is still a work in progress, but we expect reporting to present the facts as they stand. Going forward, Qatar remains firmly committed to cooperation, transparency and continuous improvement of its labour system.Fahad Al-ManaMedia attache to the UK, government communications office of Qatar

workers?,"When Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup in 2010, the triumphant Gulf state unveiled plans to host the most spectacular of all World Cup tournaments and began an ambitious building plan of state-of-the-art stadiums, luxury hotels and a sparkling new metro.
Yet, over the next decade, the brutal conditions in which hundreds of thousands of migrant workers toiled in searing heat to build Qatars World Cup vision has been exposed, with investigations into the forced labour , debt bondage and worker death toll causing international outrage.
In an attempt to quell the mounting criticism, Qatar announced sweeping labour reforms in 2019. This included ending kafala, the system that made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employers permission, effectively trapping workers who were being exploited and abused. Other reforms included the first minimum wage for migrant workers in the region and harsher penalties for companies that did not comply with the new labour laws.
When they came into force in September 2020, the reforms were met with wide acclaim. Fifa called them groundbreaking. The UN said they marked a new era. An international trade union referred to them as a gamechanger. Even human rights groups, long critical of Qatars record on labour rights, gave them a cautious welcome.
Yet more than 40 migrant workers who talked to the Guardian in Qatar in September and October this year say that for them, nothing much has changed.
Despite the International Labour Organisation (ILO) claiming that more than 200,000 workers have changed employers since the new laws were rolled out, the Guardian met only one worker  a young man from Kenya  who had managed to leave his job.
His experience spoke strongly of the potential empowerment the new laws could bring to workers lives. When he first arrived in Qatar, he was earning 625 rials (£127) a month as a construction worker. Now he is working for a logistics company with a salary almost three times higher. Im able to send much more money home. Now I cant complain, he says.
Yet everyone else the Guardian spoke to who wanted to change jobs says it is difficult or impossible to do so.
They allege their companies are simply ignoring the new laws. Some say their bosses threaten to impose fines or hold back wages if they try to change jobs, and that they are living so close to destitution this could be catastrophic.
Other workers say employers refuse to sign resignation letters or issue no-objection certificates, seemingly unaware that neither are required under the reformed labour code.
They threaten us, saying they will deduct the cost of our room and bedding from our salary and refuse to pay end-of-service benefits if we try to leave, one Indian security guard says. We are still under their control.
A Kenyan security guard says: I found another job but when I went to my company, they refused to release me. I waited three months and they refused again. He says he could go to a labour court to fight his case but would have to pay for transport that he cannot afford and take time off work that his company will not allow.
Migrant-rights.org, an advocacy group for migrant workers across the Gulf, describe the end of kafala as a mirage, saying that employers could easily prevent unhappy workers from leaving.
When asked if the reforms had made a difference, another worker from Nepal gives a simple verdict: Kafala is alive.
The new minimum wage of 1,000 rials a month, plus food and board, appears to be more rigorously enforced. Most low-wage workers interviewed said they receive the legal minimum, a significant increase on their previous salaries, except some security guards who routinely work 12-hour shifts, but do not receive the mandated overtime payments.
Yet the new minimum wage set by the Qatari government, one of the richest countries in the world, is still equivalent to just £1 an hour.
Such low wages mean that workers often remain in Qatar for years, unable to afford to return home to their families. One Nepali worker who talked to the Guardian has not seen his wife and child in five years. When I call my son he doesnt come to me, he says. He wont [even] talk to me on the phone.
The Qatari authorities and the ILO acknowledge that the reforms are a work in progress. [The Qatari government] are faced with implementation challenges and with some level of resistance, which is not surprising given their magnitude, says Max Tuñón, head of the ILO project in Qatar.
A spokesperson for the government says that with the new laws in place, the emphasis had shifted to implementation and enforcement: Achieving systemic change is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company will take. Strict penalties have been imposed on companies that try to evade the law, they add.
Qatars Supreme Committee, the body in charge of delivering the World Cup, said the tournament is a powerful catalyst for delivering a sustainable human and social legacy ahead of, during, and beyond the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
It said in a statement: Our commitment to workers welfare has resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision, and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.
Human rights groups are warning that Qatar is running out of time to ensure the new reforms actually make life better for migrant workers before the start of the World Cup in November next year.
[Qatars] significant reform to the kafala sponsorship system didnt happen until late in 2020, 10 years after the country put itself in the global spotlight, says James Lynch, a director at human rights group FairSquare.
The reforms have been beset by teething difficulties and pushback from the business community, and so there are real questions about whether it is going to deliver on its transformative potential in the lead-up to and beyond the World Cup.
Most of the eight World Cup stadiums and related infrastructure had been completed by the end of 2020, before the reforms fully came into effect.
There is an urgent need for an injection of political will to ensure this and other reforms have a meaningful impact for workers, and embed these changes for the long term, Lynch says.
Qatar, Fifa and the ILO have said repeatedly that the World Cup will leave a lasting legacy of better workers rights in Qatar and across the region. So far, anecdotal evidence suggests that legacy is far from secure.
In the road construction works near central Doha last month, the Guardian met four workers who had recently arrived from India employed by AlJaber Engineering. AlJaber, one of Qatars top construction firms, built the Al Thumama Stadium. Along with all other World Cup contractors, AlJaber must adhere to strict worker welfare standards which, among other things, do not allow workers to pay recruitment fees.
But the four workers claim they each paid almost £1,000 in recruitment fees to secure their jobs. Their claims suggest that AlJaber could be failing to apply the World Cup worker welfare standards to its new contracts. AlJaber Engineering did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Human rights campaigners are already questioning what pressure there will be on the Qatari government to ensure the new laws are actually implemented on the ground after the World Cup ends next year.
In a recent interview, Malcolm Bidali, a Kenyan blogger and migrant worker who was detained, held in solitary confinement, and then charged with spreading false news for writing about the plight of migrant workers online, is asking the same question. If I was unjustly detained and unjustly fined  while all eyes are on Qatar  what happens when no ones looking? he asks."

Across the Corniche, the palm-fringed boulevard which runs along Dohas seafront, thousands of football fans of different nationalities and religions are smiling, swaying, having fun. And that sound you hear? Not bottles being smashed, but stereotypes. Against expectations, the first Arab World Cup  and the first Muslim World Cup  is not only building bridges between East and West but changing perceptions of the country itself.
The other hero in this rose-tinted story? The power of sport itself. Over the weekend Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, praised Qatar for taking real steps since winning the right to host the World Cup, particularly in relation to human rights and workers welfare. It followed a promise by Hassan Al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the Qatar 2022 supreme committee, that the tournament would set new benchmarks for social, human, economic and environmental development  and will forever be remembered as innovative, sustainable and transformative.
But will the World Cup really change Qatar  or merely alter perceptions of the country? As usual, it pays to be sceptical.
Qatar, of course, insists it has made fundamental changes  in particular the abolition of the kafala system in 2020, which stopped migrants from changing jobs or leaving the country without their employers permission. The abolition of kafala, the liberalisation of the job market and implementation of a national minimum wage would have happened in time, says one insider. But has the World Cup been a catalyst? Unquestionably.
But there are caveats and asterisks. Last week Amnesty International said that the new laws were not yet being implemented by all employers, leaving migrant workers still facing widespread exploitation. That sentiment is echoed by Nicholas McGeehan , of the human rights organisation FairSquare, who warns there is genuine concern that as soon as the spotlight is taken away after 2022, these reforms will be rolled back.
McGeehan also points to the lack of investigation into the deaths of at least 6,500 migrant workers from south?east Asia in Qatar since 2010 as another reason to be sceptical about claims the country has fundamentally changed. The families still have no answers as to how these workers died, because no one took the time to do the investigations, he says. Theyve also ruled out their access to compensation. I think thats inexcusable. And I would hope the players who participate in the World Cup agree.
What about freedom of speech? Qatar is certainly more open than most countries in the Middle East, with Reporters Without Borders noting that the outspoken Qatari TV broadcaster Al Jazeera has transformed the media landscape in the rest of the Arab world. But Qatar is ranked 128 out of 179 countries in the Press Freedom Index. In 2010 when it won the right to host the World Cup its position was 121st. Qatar was already leading the way on media freedoms in the region, McGeehan says. It is a stretch to say it has become more liberal over the past decade.
A similarly complex story emerges when it comes to LGBT rights. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, but the authorities insist that gay fans are welcome at the World Cup  providing they act conservatively. That promise appears to be genuine. When Paul Amann, the founder of the Liverpool LGBT group Kops Out, visited Qatar for the Club World Cup in 2019, he was pleasantly surprised. Its not a country I would choose to live in, he says. But I wouldnt mind revisiting it again. My husband and I went to the Corniche, museum and souk at night, and we felt entirely safe.
Again, though, there are significant caveats. As McGeehan points out, LGBT people living in Qatar face a very different experience. The laws remain deeply discriminatory, he says. And if youre gay, you are excluded from society. That takes an appalling toil on LGBT people in Qatar. It ruins their lives. Football is not going to change that. That change will come from within Qatari society.
Have there been actual changes since the country won the right to host the World Cup? Sure. Infrastructure-wise, it has been transformed. And when the academic Joel Rookwood visited Qatar for the Club World Cup in 2019, he noticed there were far more women fans compared to when he conducted research at the Asian Cup in 2011. Back then he saw just six women across 14 games. It wasnt just that there were far more women in 2019, he says. It was that they went unnoticed. They were accepted. I think thats a really big shift.
Even so, it is hard to make a case that Qatar has become significantly more liberal and open since 2010. Yet, for many football fans, that probably does not matter.
A few years ago when Rookwood interviewed supporters who travel to World Cups about the 2022 tournament, for instance, he found the overwhelming majority made little reference to Qatars human rights violations, discussed continuously by media sources and non-governmental organisation. As one fan put it to him: You dont really think of the workers. I know it sounds bad, but  once youre there its party time.
Such attitudes do not surprise McGeehan. When asked about the tournaments potential legacy McGeehan is blunt. Hosting the World Cup has largely benefited Qatars reputation. It is now identifiable on the world stage. And while that has come at a cost on one or two issues, for every fan who is concerned about migrant workers and LGBT issues, theres probably another 40 or 50 people who are uncritically consuming PR content that presents Qatar as a luxurious destination with five-star hotels and camel rides.
Remind me, how do you say sportswashing in Arabic?"

The international players union, Fifpro, in conjunction with the Building and Wood Workers International, has led discussions with a number of stakeholders over the centre, where workers would be able to access legal advice and support. On Friday a key World Cup sponsor, Adidas, publicly declared its support for such a plan.
Employment conditions and human rights must continue to improve when the spotlight on Qatar has dimmed after the World Cup ends, Fifpros general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said. The centre  has the potential to give migrant workers a permanent place to seek help when necessary, and ensure they are not isolated or marginalised by employers.
In a statement released to the Guardian, Adidas said it supported the creation of a permanent office for the UN agency International Labour Organization in Qatar. The ILO has a technical cooperation programme with Qatar to ensure compliance with international labour conventions that runs until 2023.
An Adidas spokesperson said: For the past seven years, we have been engaged with our partners to improve the human rights situation in Qatar. This includes support for the establishment of an independent ILO office as an independent local monitoring body, strengthening the rights of foreign migrants and promoting a national minimum wage for all workers.
Informal conversations with Qatari representatives are believed to have taken place over a permanent workers centre, with Fifa and other World Cup sponsors involved. Discussions are said to be collaborative, with the aim of gaining support from the Qatari regime.
The workers centre is one concrete idea as footballs attention turns to next years tournament and the legacy it will leave.
Players from a number of international sides have, in the past year, protested in support of greater human rights in Qatar. This week Amnesty International published an assessment of the progress made by the Qatari authorities in securing protections and rights for migrant workers. It found that certain key changes  essentially relating to the freedom for workers to leave jobs and the country  were not being observed consistently, and that workers were still being denied wages. Progress has stagnated, the report concluded.
The Qatari supreme committee, responsible for the delivery of the World Cup, has pledged to implement changes to labour laws as part of its legacy contribution to workers rights in Qatar. It rejected Amnestys conclusions, claiming the situation had improved for hundreds of thousands of workers. Qatar has never shied away from acknowledging that its labour system is still a work in progress, authorities said.
The Amnesty report also called on football associations across the world to use their voice to ensure that the rights of migrant workers are respected. There is a growing interest in how the English FA will meet that challenge.
The FA signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatar in 2018, with the then chairman, Greg Clarke, describing it as a partnership dedicated to sharing knowledge and experience to support the development of football. It is unclear whether the agreement extends beyond that.
After England qualified for the World Cup Gareth Southgate said he and his team would take the time to educate ourselves over Qatar. If we feel that there are areas that we can highlight and help, then clearly weve always tried to do that, and we would do that, the manager said.
The Guardian understands that the Professional Footballers Association will hold focus groups with club captains in each division to discuss the key issues relating to Qatar.
Pressure will surely build on players in England to move from education to action. But the picture is likely to be complicated. The FAs MOU with Qatar was brokered with the approval of the Conservative government and Southgate noted this week that we as a nation do a lot of business with Qatar and that the situation is hugely complex.
An FA spokesperson said: We are in dialogue with Amnesty International and also with Fifa, Uefa, other member associations and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and we are working closely with all to ensure that we approach our participation in the upcoming Fifa World Cup in a socially responsible manner.
From those discussions to date, we believe that there is evidence of substantial progress being made by Qatar in relation to workers rights. However we recognise there is still more to be done. Our view remains that change is best achieved by working collaboratively with others so that we can continue to ask the right questions, while always being mindful that we have our own challenges in this country."

Footballs governing body said it would not be taking any action but would continue to follow this matter closely, after Ibhais was arrested at his house on Monday.
Ibhais held the position of deputy communications director for the Supreme Committee, the Qatari body responsible for the delivery of next years World Cup. He was removed from the role in 2019 after being accused of fraud over a contract to produce social media content for the tournament. A trial in Doha ended with Ibhais being sent to jail for five years, before he was released on bail pending an appeal earlier this year. Ibhais, who is of Palestinian descent and holds a Jordanian passport, has always denied the charges. He says he has been singled out by Qatar because of his support for migrant workers in the country.
Ibhaiss latest arrest followed the publication of an article by the investigative website Josimar, which detailed WhatsApp messages apparently from the Crisis Comms group of the Supreme Committee during a strike by migrant workers in 2019. In those messages the head of the Supreme Committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, is seen to argue that the communications team should avoid referring to World Cup workers being part of the strike and that the team should put a narrative on delays which had seen workers go without pay for months. Ibhais then says we cant say that there were no WC workers striking.
In a separate conversation with the executive director of communications, Fatima al-Nuaimi, Ibhais says of the strike: We need to fix it then do the PR part. Lying is not Qatars way and should not be. These conversations took place on 4 August 2019. On 12 November Ibhais was arrested on suspicion of fraud.
On Wednesday Ibhaiss family released a statement accusing Fifa of turning a blind eye to his fate and said he had not been given a fair trial, an accusation supported by representatives of Human Rights Watch. We demand a serious, prompt and meaningful action from Fifa to stop the extreme injustice put upon Abdullah by the authorities of the country they chose to host the World Cup, the family said, [and] to press for a fair trial for Abdullah and for his immediate release  as there is no justification for his detention.
Ibhais says he was denied access to legal representation during his interrogation by police and signed a confession that was false. Qatari authorities, meanwhile, argue they have audio and visual evidence of criminal activity on his part.
On Thursday Fifa responded publicly for the first time. In a statement released to the Guardian, it said it had spoken with Ibhais several times and carefully reviewed the available information.
It is Fifas position that any person deserves a trial that is fair and where due process is observed and respected, it said. Fifa has duly received the complaint from Mr Ibhais and replied to the complaint in writing, having carefully reviewed the available information about his case. We have since been in touch with our Qatari counterparts and on several occasions with Mr Ibhais. Fifa will continue to follow this matter closely.
In a statement released to the Guardian, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said: Abdullah Ibhais claim that he was targeted for taking a position on a labour-related matter is a fabrication and a lie.
The allegations presented by Ibhais have no credibility. The case against Ibhais is rooted in evidence [of alleged manipulation and misuse of state funds], and has absolutely nothing to do with personal opinions or actions on labour-related matters.
The reality was that no World Cup workers were involved in the strike. Any suggestion that the use of the words narrative and spin indicates a desire to cover-up is wholly false.
On Friday Amnesty International added to the voices calling for action on Ibhaiss detention. Abdullah Ibhais was arrested just days after he spoke publicly about his case, in what appears to amount to arbitrary detention in retaliation for speaking out about his experiences, said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.
Qatari authorities must immediately launch an independent investigation into Abdullahs claims of ill-treatment, and quash his conviction and sentence if they are found to have been based on a coerced confession. Qatar must ensure fair trial standards are upheld in all cases, including ensuring all defendants are provided with legal representation from the moment of their arrest."

staff,"When Fifa executives step on to the asphalt in Doha next November for the start of the 2022 World Cup finals, their next stop is likely to be the check-in at one of Qatars glittering array of opulent hotels, built to provide the most luxurious possible backdrop to the biggest sporting event on earth.
Now, with a year to go before the first match, fans who want to emulate the lifestyle of the sporting elite can head to Fifas hospitality website to plan their stay in the host nation. There they can scroll through a catalogue of exclusive, Fifa-endorsed accommodation, from boutique hotels to five-star resorts.
Yet behind the scenes of some of those hotels, while guests lounge around the pool or sip cocktails at the bar, migrant hotel workers claim they are struggling to survive on wages of £1 an hour.
The Guardian stayed at or visited seven of the hotels listed on Fifas hospitality website and in interviews and conversations with more than 40 workers  employed directly and through sub-contractors  uncovered a number of allegations of serious labour rights violations and low wages. The hotels have not been named to protect the identity of the workers who spoke to the Guardian.
Many workers alleged they worked extremely long hours, with some saying they had not had a day off for months. While they spent their days surrounded by the most luxurious of settings, some workers said they were housed in overcrowded rooms in stifling labour camps. A few workers claimed their passports had been confiscated. Many said their employer would not let them change jobs.
While rooms in the hotels listed on Fifas hospitality site are charged at up to £820 a night when bought as part of a package, almost every worker the Guardian spoke to employed in housekeeping, security, valet service, cleaning or gardening said they earned less than £1.25 an hour. Many were working for less than £1 an hour.
Workers made multiple allegations of breaches of Qatars labour law, which suggest shortcomings in Qatars labour reforms. These promised an end to abusive working conditions and the kafala sponsorship system that meant workers could not change jobs or leave the country without their employers consent.
The workers allegations also imply that Fifa has failed to effectively carry out basic checks on the hotels investigated by the Guardian that it had signed up to its catalogue, in breach of its own human rights policy, which requires it to prevent labour abuses linked to its operations.
While most workers the Guardian spoke to received salaries in line with the new minimum wage, which came into force in March 2021, that wage still equates to only £1 an hour plus a small allowance for food and board.
The Guardian has also seen payslips from one worker employed directly by a hotel in Fifas catalogue, which show that when the minimum wage was introduced his basic wage of 750 rials (£150) rose to 1,000 rials (£200) a month, but allowances for food or transport, for example, were cut by the same amount, meaning his salary stayed the same.
Sometimes I ask myself why I came here, he said. The World Cup is a big thing and everyone enjoys it, but the way they treat us  we are all tired of it.
As darkness fell on one of the properties in Fifas brochure, guests retired indoors, leaving David*, a migrant worker from Africa, labouring near the swimming pool.
A night in a standard room in the hotel costs more than David earns in a month. He is desperate to change jobs but despite recent government legislation allowing this, he sayssaid he is trapped. My friends have tried to change jobs but our company refuses to let them go, he said. We have to accept it. Our boss does whatever he wants.
The hotel boasts sumptuous suites and a marble-lined lobby, but his own lodgings are starkly different: a small room shared with five others in a run-down compound on the edge of Doha.
Ranjit, a security guard, stood on duty nearby, as he had done for the previous 11 hours. Ranjits salary works out at about 80p an hour. Yet for five months he kept nothing; everything went towards paying off the illegal £1,300 fee he was forced to hand a recruitment agent back home to secure the job. Its a scam, he said. Here they suck your blood.
Some workers across the seven hotels said they were happy with their jobs and the staff accommodation provided by their hotels. Yet the majority said they felt trapped between the demands of their employers and the need to earn money for their families back in their own countries.
At one hotel, a worker alleged that the management would only give bonuses to staff who handed over their passports. It is illegal for employers to keep workers passports in Qatar.
We have fallen into a trap and cant get out, said another worker at the hotel.
With 1.2 million fans expected during the World Cup, the hospitality sector can look forward to a lucrative tournament.
A few hotels demonstrated good practice by recruiting their staff directly through online adverts, rather than through labour agents who often extract extortionate and illegal fees from recruits, but even in these properties the Guardian spoke to staff who were paid very low wages.
The worst allegations of abuse were by workers employed through sub-contractors, in particular hotel security guards and gardeners.
At another hotel on Fifas website a Kenyan security guard was about to begin his 12-hour shift, which he said stretched beyond 15 hours when he added travel time to and from his labour camp.
If he works all month without a break he earns 2,000 rials (£400); far less than he was promised when he signed up for the job in Kenya. If he took a day off, his employer would cut his wages by 50 rials (£10). Not that he often had that option. During the summer we had to work for three months without a day off, he said.
His passport has been confiscated by his company. Maybe they think if you have your passport you can run away to another company, he said. We have no other option, so we take what is on the table.
The Guardians findings have shone a spotlight directly on world footballs governing body, which has been criticised by Amnesty International for taking a hands-off approach to workers rights in the host nation. A spokesperson for Fifa said it takes any claim concerning the rights of workers contributing to the hosting of Fifa events very seriously.
The spokesperson said a dedicated team was implementing an audit and compliance system for companies involved in the delivery of the World Cup, including hotels, to ensure workers rights were respected. While there is a need for continued improvement, we have already seen important progress by many hotels in Qatar in recent months, the spokesperson added.
Isobel Archer, a specialist in labour rights in the Gulf at the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), a charity headquartered in London, said hotels must recognise their responsibilities to all workers, including those employed through sub-contractors.
If hotel brands put even half the effort into scrutinising their suppliers labour practices as they do the height of their reception desks or the density of guest room pillows, wed see transformational change for hotel workers, she said.
A report by the BHRRC this year also found evidence of widespread exploitation of hotel workers in Qatar which, it said, should be a red flag for football teams, fans and corporate sponsors.
A Qatari official said the government takes any violation of its labour laws very seriously, including those in the hospitality sector. The official said Qatar had a zero-tolerance approach towards violating companies, issuing harsh penalties that included fines and prison sentences.
Awareness-raising initiatives have been launched to provide workers with information on how to raise complaints against their employer, and new mechanisms have been introduced to facilitate better access to justice, the official added.
*Names have been changed or omitted to protect workers identities."

The DBU said its two training-kit sponsors would make way for messages critical of Qatar, which is hosting next years tournament, and that it would minimise the number of trips to the country to avoid commercial activities that promote the World Cup hosts events.
DBU has long been strongly critical of the World Cup in Qatar, its chief executive officer, Jakob Jensen, said in a statement. But now we are further intensifying our efforts and critical dialogue so that we take advantage of the fact that we have qualified to work for more change in the country.
In addition, we have long drawn attention to the challenges facing Fifa and Qatar, and we will continue to do so.
This week Amnesty International published a 48-page report that said thousands of migrant workers in Qatar were being trapped and exploited, with many facing wage theft. The government of Qatar denied the accusations but acknowledged that its labour system was still a work in progress.
Jensen said he was pleased to see the DBUs commercial partners give up space on the training kits for messages to improve conditions for the migrant workers in Qatar.
Its a very strong signal when our partners also engage in the fight for better conditions in Qatar, he said. The partners support Danish football, the mens national team and the sporting participation in the European Championship and the World Cup  not the individual host."

With a year to go until the football World Cup kicks off, Mohameds response may have the events organisers worried. After all, about 70% of Qatars population are from the cricket-loving subcontinent.
But on a Friday evening in Aspire Park, filled with families enjoying picnics and children playing football, another Mohamed has a different take. Were all excited and supporting the World Cup. The stadiums are amazing, says the Egyptian chemistry teacher. All Arabs are proud. Its already a triumph!
The two Mohameds reflect the diversity and divisions  of nationality, culture and sport  in this tiny Gulf state of 2.6 million, where 95% of the working population are foreigners.
For Qataris and Arabic speakers, the overwhelming emotions appear to be pride and excitement to be hosting the first World Cup in the region. But for the low-wage workers the Guardian has interviewed, mostly from south Asia, the response is ambivalent: a mixture of a lack of interest, a focus on earning money and the knowledge that even if they wanted to watch a match, they could never afford a ticket.
Qatars diminutive size  organisers have called it the most compact World Cup ever  is evident on the final approach to Doha from the air. In just a few minutes you glide past Al Bayt Stadium, then the Lusail Stadium comes into view, like a giant wicker basket, and as the landing gear is lowered you pass by Ras Abu Aboud, a stadium made partly of shipping containers, which will be dismantled after the event.
The view from above also reveals Qatars monumental ambition and wealth: seven stadiums, a new airport, roads, a metro system and hundreds of hotels. In 2017, Qatars finance minister said the country was spending $500m a week on World Cup-related construction.
The furthest stadium from Doha  just a 30-minute drive away  is Al Bayt, a graceful structure designed like a nomadic tent. The only other building in sight is a McDonalds, built in the same style as the stadium.
Touchy guards stand in the shade and shout at you if you try to take a photo. One says he has no interest in the World Cup, he is just here to make money. I can be standing guard here beside the stadium or over in that town, it doesnt make any difference to me, he says. Ill leave before the World Cup. During the event well have far too much work.
Sitting in a park in Doha, a group of south Asian community activists who have all worked in Qatar for more than a decade are similarly ambivalent. When I came to Qatar there was nothing here. We built this country but they are not thinking about us workers, says one. How can we afford World Cup tickets on our salaries? adds another.
While ticket prices have not yet been announced, Fifa is already selling hospitality packages that start at £705 for a first-round match and rise to £845,000 for a 10-match package in a private suite.
The only group of low-wage workers who appear excited about the tournament are Kenyans, steeped in years of Premier League coverage. I love football. I would love to see the players in real life. I would tell my children about it when I am old, says one, a guard at a top-end hotel.
The shadow of abusive labour practices and workers deaths hangs over the tournament despite new laws to introduce a minimum wage and give workers the right to change jobs. Concern for workers rights has prompted protests by the Norwegian, German, Danish and Dutch national teams during the qualifying rounds.
Those concerns are shared by some workers. We hear news of people losing their lives, so I dont think the World Cup should be coming to Qatar. I dont think they have apologised yet, at least to the families of those guys. They should have done something to avoid this, says a Kenyan barista.
The mood among Qataris and other Arabic speakers in the country is far more upbeat. There is a sense that the country is punching above its weight, an eagerness to showcase the best of the region and satisfaction at overcoming a series of controversies that have dogged Qatar since it won the right to host the event in 2010: allegations of corruption at the bidding stage, criticism of the abusive conditions endured by migrant workers, an economic blockade led by its neighbours Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and then the coronavirus pandemic.
The World Cup will be amazing! says Mustafa, an Egyptian Liverpool and Mohamed Salah fan who manages a store in one of Qatars upmarket shopping centres. Lots of tourists will come. They will experience a new culture. Its a chance for different people to come together.
Sitting nearby is Jamal, a Qatari citizen and retired IT worker, who says the World Cup is important for the region. Were the first Arab country to host it. Its a big achievement, he says. The World Cup means a lot to Qatar. Weve done better than other countries which are bigger than us.
In the VIP wing of another mall, Abdulrahman and his friends are drinking coffee served out of a vintage delivery van. Nearby, young Asian men who want to gawp at the top-end designer stores inside are turned away at the entrance. Abdulrahman, a Qatari who works for the interior ministry, tells me about the training he is doing with his counterparts from the UK and the US to ensure the World Cup is safe and secure.
The Qatari people are very eager for the World Cup. We are a country of openness; we want to excel at everything and we welcome everyone, he says.
When I ask him who will win the World Cup, he replies with a smile: Qatar!"

Last year Qatar passed two laws to end restrictions on migrant workers leaving the country or changing jobs without their employers permission, which were widely welcomed. However, Amnesty has accused the authorities of complacency in applying the laws and says it has led to the worst elements of the kafala system, which binds workers to their employer, resurfacing.
A new 48-page Amnesty report, Reality Check 2021, quotes one migrant worker saying she was threatened by her employer when she wanted to change jobs and told she had to pay 6,000 Qatari riyals (£1,200)  more than five times her monthly salary  for a no-objection certificate or else be sent home.
Although the change in law should have allowed her to change jobs freely, the complaint she submitted to the Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs was rejected, Amnesty says.
Other practices, such as withholding salaries and benefits to make it harder for workers to leave their jobs, are also still going on, according to Amnesty.
Apparent complacency by the authorities is leaving thousands of workers at continued risk of exploitation by unscrupulous employers, with many unable to change jobs and facing wage theft, said Mark Dummett, the human rights organisations global issues programme director.
They have little hope of remedy, compensation or justice. After the World Cup, the fate of the workers who remain in Qatar will be even more uncertain.
Qatars treatment of its migrant workforce of 2 million has come under unrelenting scrutiny since it won the right to host the competition in 2010.
In August Amnesty also accused the country of failing to investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers in the past decade.
It has now urged Fifa to call on the Qatar government to fulfil its programme of labour reforms before the opening match of the World Cup on 21 November next year.
Qatar is one of the richest countries in the world but its economy depends on the 2 million migrant workers who live there, Dummett said. By sending a clear signal that labour abuses will not be tolerated, penalising employers who break laws and protecting workers rights, Qatar can give us a tournament that we can all celebrate. But this is yet to be achieved.
Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UKs chief executive, said the Football Association could do more to press the authorities in Doha. The exploitation of Qatars massive migrant workforce has already cast a dark shadow over next years World Cup, and the FA ought to use the remaining year until kick-off to push for lasting labour reforms in Qatar, he said.
The FA is part of the Uefa Working Group on Workers Rights in Qatar and can press the Doha authorities over strengthening migrant worker protections, investigating worker deaths and helping to fashion a tournament with a genuinely positive legacy.
Its more important than ever that Englands coaching staff, players and supporters raise human rights issues ahead of next years kick-off.
In a statement, the government of Qatar said it rejected Amnestys assertion that labour reforms have not translated into changes on the ground for migrant workers.
Amnesty fails to document a single story from among the 242,870 workers who have successfully changed jobs since barriers were removed in September 2020, or from the more than 400,000 workers who have directly benefited from the new minimum wage through salary increases and other financial incentives, it said.
Since exit permits were removed in 2018, hundreds of thousands of workers have left Qatar and returned without permission from their employer; improvements to the Wage Protection System now protect more than 96% of eligible workers from wage abuse; new visa centres in labour-sending countries have significantly reduced exploitative practices before workers arrive in Qatar; and new rules extend the ban on summer working to minimise the effects of heat stress.In the first half of 2021, 35,280 accommodation and worksite inspections were carried out and 13,724 penalties were issued to violating companies, including worksite closures, fines and prison sentences. A further 4,840 site visits were made by labour inspectors to raise awareness of the new laws among employers and employees. Systemic reform is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company takes time."

built Qatars World Cup dream deserve some of David Beckhams pay packet,"I doubt Nirmala Pakrin knows who David Beckham is, but she knows about Qatar.
Her husband, Rupchandra Rumba, a 24-year-old from Nepal, died in 2019, gasping for breath in a squalid camp for labourers on the outskirts of Doha, while working for a contractor on one of the new World Cup stadiums.
Pakrin received some compensation from insurance schemes her husband had taken out before he left home, but his employer in Qatar paid her less than £1,500.
I visited her near the time in the small room she lived in on the outskirts of Kathmandu with her then six-year-old son, Niraj. He keeps asking one question, she told me, Wheres my dad?
As someone who met children like Niraj when he visited Nepal as a Unicef ambassador, you might expect Beckham to think twice before signing up to represent Qatar.
But it has been widely reported that the former England captain, who visited Qatar this month, has agreed a deal to be an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup and beyond, for an astronomical fee.
A spokesperson for Beckham said: [David] has seen the passion for football in the country and the long-term commitment thats been made to hosting the World Cup and delivering a lasting legacy for the region. He has always talked about the power of football as a force for good on many levels.
Another source said: David believes in Qatars commitment to progress and that the World Cup  the first to be held in the Arab world  can effect significant positive change.
I was also in Qatar this month, but the picture Beckham described is very different to the one I saw, and have witnessed during eight years of reporting from the country.
Driving between Dohas skyscrapers, I passed the twisting, shimmering al-Bidda tower, home to the offices of Qatars World Cup organising committee, which were fitted out by workers from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, some of whom went unpaid for months.
Heading north I drove into Lusail City, a district of gaudy and outrageous buildings, which will host the World Cup final. In 2014 I reported that one was being built by North Koreans employed in conditions likely to constitute slave labour. It is now a luxury hotel.
On the edge of the city I passed the labour camps where I have seen workers crammed 10 to a room, with hundreds sharing a handful of toilets and fly-infested kitchens.
World Cup stadium construction has only ever involved a fraction of the vast migrant workforce in Qatar, but the event has fuelled a building boom  a new airport, roads, metro system, hotels  which has employed many thousands, largely through private companies.
The World Cup organising committee says it has been at the forefront of efforts to improve working conditions in the country, but as I drive down to Al-Janoub stadium I remember the workers I interviewed there in 2014, who said they were being paid as little as 45p an hour. Four years later I met the devastated family of Tej Narayan Tharu, a Nepali worker who fell to his death at the stadium.
Tharu was one of more than 6,500 workers from south Asia who have died in Qatar since it was awarded the right to host the World Cup. They were not all construction workers, but 70% of their deaths were not properly investigated, according to research by Amnesty International.
There have been 38 deaths on World Cup construction projects, of which 35 have been classified by the organisers as non-work related.
Beckham would have seen none of this. Instead, he was photographed walking through Souq Waqif, a bazaar and dining venue popular with visitors, as long as they are not young migrant workers from south Asia. In 2016, I filmed them being apparently turned away from the premises by the police.
Last month I witnessed more low-wage migrant workers seemingly being ejected from Aspire Park and from the VIP wing of a shopping mall.
Beckham also visited Msheireb, perhaps Qatars most stylish district, full of top hotels and restaurants. It is also packed with security guards enduring long shifts in the sweltering heat. We know about their lives because one of them, a Kenyan named Malcolm Bidali, wrote articles describing the gross mistreatment he and others suffered. In May, he was detained for almost a month, charged with publishing false news and fined 25,000 rials (nearly £5,000).
When I asked a Nepali security guard in Msheireb if he would like to watch a World Cup match, he shrugged and said: Id like to, but how can I afford a ticket? The World Cup is not for us.
The Qatari authorities cite recent labour reforms as a sign that things are changing. The reforms have been described as a new era for workers rights by a number of international organisations and trade unions. In September 2020, the regime announced an end to the kafala sponsorship system, under which workers were unable to change jobs without their employers permission, leaving them vulnerable to forced labour, a form of slavery.
That policy appears to have had some impact when it was first introduced, with the Qatari authorities claiming in the summer that 100,000 workers had changed jobs. But in recent months it seems employers have begun to push back against it.
My company refuses to let me go, said one Indian security guard at an upmarket hotel. They threaten us, saying they will deduct the cost of our room and bedding from our salary and refuse to pay the end of service benefit if we try to leave. We are still under their control.
The other flagship reform, the introduction of a minimum wage, which came into force in March 2021, is equally flawed. The minimum wage was set at 1,000 rials (£200) a month, plus food and board. If food and board are not provided, workers must be paid an additional allowance of 300 rials for food and 500 rials for board.
The monthly wage works out at £1 an hour. The food allowance means workers have £2 a day to feed themselves.
What is shocking is that some of the worlds leading labour rights bodies  the UNs International Labour Organization and the International Trade Union Confederation  endorsed this poverty pay.
Since when is a minimum wage of £1 an hour, in one of the richest countries in the world per capita, something to applaud?
A Qatari official acknowledged that its labour system is still a work in progress but said its labour reforms have benefitted over a million migrant workers.
Since taking the decision to use the World Cup as a catalyst to accelerate reforms, Qatar has engaged collaboratively and constructively with a range of international partners and critics, said the official. Qatars laws have set new standards for the region  This progress does not mean our work is done. With the new laws now in place, the emphasis has shifted to effective implementation and enforcement.
The official said Qatar has stepped up efforts to identify and punish companies that try to evade the law with stricter penalties for violators and new courts for workers to access justice. Qatar is committed to protecting workers from all forms of exploitation and abuse. Labour reform is a complex issue, and we believe that solutions are best found through dialogue and engagement, the official added.
Qatar and its backers should be exploring ways to compensate all the workers who have been forced to pay illegal recruitment fees, whose wages have been paid late or not at all and who have suffered from appallingly low salaries.
That is not to say there has been no progress. Passport confiscation appears to be less common and most workers (with the exception of some security guards) seem to be receiving at least the minimum wage. While salaries remain shockingly low, they are higher than they were when I first started reporting from Qatar in 2013, although so too are living costs.
A spokesperson for Qatars World Cup organising committee said its, commitment to ensuring the health, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast and unwavering.
The spokesperson said the committees work had resulted in significant improvements to living standards and working conditions, and had accelerated Qatars recent groundbreaking labour reforms.
We acknowledge that there remains a long journey ahead, and we are committed  with our partners in Qatar and beyond  to ensuring that we continue to deliver the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable, and lasting labour reforms, the spokesperson said.
But even if you buy the official narrative, these reforms are too little too late. Almost all of the key World Cup infrastructure was completed by the end of 2020. So whichever way you look at it, this will be a World Cup built on exploitation.
So what should footballers such as Beckham do?
Follow the lead of other footballers who have taken the time to engage, educate themselves and act.
The Norwegian, German, Danish and Dutch teams have already made powerful stands for workers rights during the World Cup qualifying rounds.
Sweden cancelled a training camp in Qatar over concerns for workers rights. Liverpool refused to stay at a hotel where I had uncovered allegations of labour abuse.
As Norway and Southampton footballer Mohamed Elyounoussi said in a recent interview with the Guardian. You cannot just go in and talk about that country if you have no knowledge about the country or how it works. He urged people to listen to organisations such as Amnesty. I think it is good to listen to them. We have a voice and I think it is good that we can use it for the greater good.
The most important people to listen to are the group Beckham seems to have forgotten about  the men who built the stadiums and infrastructure he appears so keen to promote.
On a humid evening, I sat on the grass verge of the corniche, a promenade that sweeps around the bay at the heart of Doha, with a group of Nepali workers. Their verdict was clear. They just use us and then throw us away, said one. Its simple. They just dont care."

The human rights organisation said the majority of migrant worker deaths in Qatar are attributed to natural causes, cardiac or respiratory failure; classifications which are meaningless without the underlying cause of death explained, according to one expert cited.
As a result, as many as 70% of deaths may be unexplained. In a well resourced health system, it should be possible to identify the exact cause of death in all but 1% of cases, the report said.
The findings come as Qatar and Fifa face growing pressure from footballers and national football associations to protect workers rights with just over a year to go until the World Cup begins.
Qatars World Cup organising committee has reported 38 worker deaths on World Cup construction projects, of which 35 have been classified as non-work-related. However, Amnesty believes nearly half of these deaths have not been properly investigated or explained.
The rights group says intense heat and humidity exposure is likely to be a significant factor and has urged the Qatari authorities to put in place better protections for workers.
When relatively young and healthy men die suddenly after working long hours in extreme heat, it raises serious questions about the safety of working conditions in Qatar, said Steve Cockburn, Amnestys head of economic and social justice.
In failing to investigate the underlying causes of migrant workers deaths, the Qatari authorities are ignoring warning signs which could, if addressed, save lives. This is a violation of the right to life.
Qatars treatment of its migrant workforce of 2 million has come under unrelenting scrutiny since it won the right to host the competition in 2010. In February the Guardian revealed that more than 6,500 migrant workers from south Asia had died in Qatar in the past decade.
Qatari authorities have claimed that the migrant mortality rate is within the expected range given the workforce size, but epidemiological experts quoted in Amnestys report question the authorities ability to make this claim  because of the low quality of data available.
They also said that migrant workers  who undergo health tests before departing for Qatar  are generally young, healthy and in the prime of their lives.
In May, the Qatari authorities took a number of steps intended to protect workers from the heat, including extending the summer working hours ban, when workers cannot operate outdoors during the hottest part of the day, by a month. Amnesty welcomed the measures but said they did not go far enough.
The report described the devastating toll on the families of workers who die. Under Qatar law, compensation must be paid where deaths are caused by the job, but the failure to properly investigate deaths means work-related causes may not be identified, allowing employers to avoid compensation, Amnesty said.
I did not receive any compensation from Qatar. The camp boss said the company had no compensation rules for those who died of heart attacks and those not on duty, said Bipana, the wife of Tul Bahadur Gharti, a 34-year-old construction worker from Nepal who died last year.
Being alone is very difficult. I feel like my life has been wasted  My husband was set on fire. I feel like Im burning in oil.
In response to the report, the Qatar government highlighted its record on labour reforms, including a new minimum wage and the removal of barriers to change jobs.
It claimed to have made significant progress on tackling the effects of heat stress and said injury and mortality data were in line with international best practice, setting new standards for the region.
A government spokesperson said: Qatar remains steadfast in its commitment to labour reform and will not be thrown off course by any organisation that seeks to discredit the progress we have made."

When his shift ends 12 hours later, he says he will have earned £9, just 75p an hour.
Samuel, who is from Uganda, says he almost never has a day off. You have to tell lies, like you are sick, youre not feeling good, so that you get a day off, he says.
When football fans touch down in Qatar next year, security guards such as Samuel are some of the first people they are likely to meet  politely checking their bags at the airport, greeting them outside their hotels and patrolling the shopping centres, parks and stadiums.
As Samuel talks, the clanging of a construction site and the screaming engine of a supercar echo in the background. In the distance, illuminated by the lights on construction cranes, the Lusail Stadium is nearing completion. Next year, as 80,000 spectators fill the huge bowl-shaped arena to watch the World Cup final, they will rely on thousands of private security guards for the smooth running of the event.
Qatar recently boasted of introducing comprehensive and long-lasting labour reforms, including a new minimum wage, in response to widespread criticism of the states treatment of its vast low-wage workforce.
The UNs International Labour Organization says that more than 400,000 workers will benefit from the new minimum wage and the Qatari authorities say 100,000 workers have changed jobs since the reforms were introduced.
Yet men like Samuel say they have yet to see the benefits. He says he is paid below the minimum wage, which is only £1 an hour plus food and board. Qatars labour reforms mean migrant workers are now able to change jobs without their employers permission, which they needed under the traditional kafala system, but in reality it does not appear to be that easy. Im working a 12-hour duty, I have no days off. How can I look for a job? Samuel says.
In recent weeks, guards from two security companies have staged protests over their pay and conditions. One of the companies had supplied guards for the Fifa Club World Cup in February, according to the German broadcaster WDR. The Qatari authorities say they stepped in to resolve the disputes, but the incidents have exposed the gap between the promises of reform and the experience of some workers.
Qatar and Fifa are facing increasing calls from national football associations to step up their efforts to protect workers rights. Last week, six Nordic associations wrote to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, urging him to ensure human rights are respected at all facilities used before, during and after the World Cup.
It is a matter of utmost importance for the football community across the globe  that the theatre of the greatest dreams in football also can be the stage of human rights, respect and anti-discrimination, the letter said.
The security guards employed directly at World Cup stadiums and venues may benefit from strict welfare standards imposed by the events organising committee, but thousands of people deployed at other sites across Qatar are more vulnerable to abuse.
Robert, a Kenyan guard on the same shift, says he earns even less than Samuel  just 65p an hour. His contract, seen by the Guardian, states he must work 12 hours a day, seven days a week. I feel exhausted but if you ask for a day off they tell you we will deduct it [from your salary] this month, he says.
As demand for security guards in Qatar has grown, with more than 40,000 private security guards and 74 private security companies already operating in the Gulf state, more east and west African migrant workers have been recruited with the promise of secure jobs and lucrative salaries. Most hand over large fees to recruitment agents in their home countries to secure the jobs.
Once in Qatar, they say, the lie is exposed. What you think [you are going to earn] is not what you find this side, says Samuel, who paid an agent the equivalent of £1,500 for his job.
Workers say they often find themselves housed in cramped and squalid dorms, working long shifts with few days off and having to stand for hours in searing temperatures.
The Qatari government told the Guardian it had strengthened its ability to identify and punish companies that try to evade its labour laws, with more than 7,000 penalties issued to businesses for labour offences in the last quarter of 2020.
Some, like Robert, are willing to put up with the low wages and long hours. Life here is difficult but if I stop working right now, who will assist my family back home? Nobody. So I have to work whatever, he says. Samuel says when his contract ends he is going home and will never return to Qatar.
Samuel and Robert asked the Guardian not to use their real names for fear of repercussions. They have good reason to be afraid.
On 5 May, Malcolm Bidali, a Kenyan security guard and blogger who wrote about the plight of migrant workers, was detained by Qatars state security services. Human rights groups have said his detention may be linked to his articles about workers welfare, although the authorities stated that a Kenyan national was under investigation for violating security regulations.
For the past year, Bidali has documented the mistreatment, discrimination and humiliation he and his fellow migrant workers face, in a series of online articles under the pseudonym Noah. In one, he described his accommodation: We were crammed, six of us, into a tiny room in a labour camp  Said room was characterised by bunk beds, mould and bedbugs  eight toilets for 72 of us on each floor.
On Saturday, Bidali was charged with offences related to payments received by a foreign agent for the creation and distribution of disinformation in Qatar.
A spokesperson for Migrant-Rights.org, an organisation supporting workers rights in the Gulf, said none of Bidalis writing can be considered disinformation.
He was always nuanced and multi-layered, with the sole intent of improving conditions in Qatar  not maligning the country. These charges appear to serve to intimidate others who exercise their right to freedom of expression, the spokesperson said.
James Lynch, a director at Fairsquare Projects, which advocates for workers rights, called the charges very concerning.
Lynch said, Everything we have seen indicates that this is a case of a migrant worker freely expressing his opinions and being locked up as a result.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Qatari government said workers were strongly encouraged to file complaints  if they believe a law has been broken. When reported to the authorities, most complaints are resolved in an efficient and timely manner.Achieving systemic change is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company will take time. By strengthening its enforcement procedures, Qatar is winning the battle against companies that think they can bypass the rules."

Malcolm Bidali was detained by the Qatari security services over a week ago and is being held in an undisclosed location, according to a coalition of rights groups, which include Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
Bidali, who arrived in Qatar in 2016 to work as a security guard, began to write about the treatment of migrant workers in the World Cup host country last year.
His articles, written under the pseudonym Noah, give an intimate insight into the working and living conditions of some low-wage migrants in the Gulf state. Bidali described overcrowded dormitories, confiscated passports, the lack of privacy and his unsuccessful attempts to seek better treatment.
Days before his arrest, Bidali had spoken about his life in Qatar to a group of civil society organisations and trade unions.
His detention has come as Qatar attempts to stave off threats of a World Cup boycott over migrant workers rights.
Human rights groups have called on the Qatari authorities to reveal where he is being detained. We are extremely concerned for his wellbeing, and that he may have been detained in reprisal for his legitimate human rights work, they said in a statement.
We urge the authorities to disclose Malcolms whereabouts, and ensure he is protected from torture and other ill-treatment  If Malcolm is detained solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression, he must be released immediately and unconditionally, they added.
In recent weeks, security guards have organised a number of protests in Qatar over pay and conditions. In a video on social media, scores of workers can be seen chanting: No money, no work.
A government spokesperson said later that the company had pledged to rectify all grievances immediately after the authorities intervened.
In the past nine months Qatar has introduced major reforms to its labour practices, including introducing a minimum wage of 1,000 riyals (£195) a month. If employers do not provide food and housing, they must pay an additional allowance of 800 riyals (£155). It has also largely ended the kafala (sponsorship) system, under which workers unable to change jobs without their employers permission. The practice left many workers vulnerable to exploitation and in some cases forced labour.
In a written response to the Guardian, the Qatari authorities confirmed a Kenyan national was taken into custody on 5 May and was under investigation for violating Qatars security regulations. The individual retains all his rights under the law. All procedures of the investigation are being carried out in accordance with Qatari law, said a government official.
This article was updated on 17 May 2021 to include a response from the Qatari government received after the article was published."

His comments come after players from Germany, Norway and the Netherlands wore T-shirts voicing their collective concern ahead of their qualifiers in the last week.
Asked if his players would follow suit in Tuesdays friendly in Debrecen, Hungary, the manager said he had not discussed it with them, but added: Im all about freedom of speech. Any individual has the right to express their opinion, I have no problem with that.
There is a clear issue with human rights in the building of stadiums in Qatar, and the number of people who have died. You cant sweep that under the carpet, it cant be ignored.
Initially the Norwegian team and various other teams have backed that and they are entitled to do that, with good reason. Its not acceptable for so many people to lose their lives. The disparity of wealth between rich and poor, to have people living in conditions of squalor and have people dying in those conditions is not acceptable.
On the wider issue of athletes using their position to address political subjects  Fifas disciplinary code prohibits non-sporting demonstrations  Kenny said there was a need for further discussion. He said: Where do you draw the line? Do you say, for example, America boycotting the Olympics in Russia, Russia boycotting the Olympics in America, what does that achieve? Were not sure. Years later, we still havent gauged a measurement of what that actually achieved.
Is it the handing out of the World Cup to Qatar initially, is that the problem? Or should teams refuse to go and players refuse to play? Those are different matters. Its a broader picture then in sport: what other countries do you pick and say: You cant do that? It is a very complex issue and something that needs a wider debate."

Germany lined up before kick-off in their opening Group J qualifier against Iceland at Duisburg wearing shirts displaying the message HUMAN RIGHTS, with one letter per shirt. Norway staged a similar protest on Wednesday before their match in Gibraltar when their players wore T-shirts with the message: Human rights, on and off the pitch.
The initiatives come in the wake of Guardian analysis that showed more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup 10 years ago.
Löw said he knew about his players plan to protest but that he was not the driving force behind it. The players have drawn everything on their shirts. It was supposed to be the first statement by us, by the team, he said. We stand for human rights, no matter the location. Those are our values. Therefore, it was a very good and important statement.
Fifa said after the Norway protest that no action would be taken against the players. Fifa believes in the freedom of speech, and in the power of football as a force for good, it said. No disciplinary proceedings in relation to this matter will be opened.
The English FA also issued a statement saying it intended to engage with the tournament in a socially responsible manner and that there was still much more to be done on human rights in the country. The FA said it acknowledged the recent reports regarding the conditions for migrant workers in Qatar. The statement continued: We believe that there is evidence of some progress being made by Qatar, however we recognise there is still much more to be done.
On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Qatari World Cup organiser, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), said it had always been transparent about the health and safety of workers. The spokesperson added: Since construction began in 2014, there have been three work-related fatalities and 35 non-work-related deaths. The SC has investigated each case, learning lessons to avoid any repeat in the future. The SC has disclosed each incident through public statements and or annual workers welfare progress reports."

Confirmation emerged as the English Football Association indicated a need for greater action from the World Cup hosts to protect migrant workers.
With qualifying for next years World Cup beginning in earnest, a growing number of European nations are speaking up about human rights concerns in Qatar. Before playing Gibraltar on Wednesday night, Erling Haaland and his Norway teammates wore T-shirts that read Human rights On and off the pitch.
Laws of the game prevent players from using equipment that bears any political, religious or personal slogans, but on Thursday Fifa said they would be taking no action regarding the protest.
Fifa believes in the freedom of speech and in the power of football as a force for good, a spokesperson for the governing body said. No disciplinary proceedings in relation to this matter will be opened by Fifa.
Football has begun to speak up on Qatars human rights record following a Guardian report that more than 6,500 migrant workers have died in the country over the past decade. This week Amnesty International warned of measures that could undermine recent improvements in workers rights in the country.
This month the Dutch FA said it would not boycott the tournament, in line with Amnestys recommendations, but would use the current spotlight on the World Cup and make our own contribution to efforts to improve the plight of migrant workers in Qatar.
On Thursday the English FA issued a statement saying it intended to engage with the tournament in a socially responsible manner and that there was still much more to be done on human rights in the country.
The FA said it acknowledged the recent reports regarding the conditions for migrant workers in Qatar. The statement continued: We are working closely with all to ensure that, if we qualify, we approach our participation in the upcoming Fifa World Cup in a socially responsible manner.
From those discussions to date, we believe that there is evidence of some progress being made by Qatar, however we recognise there is still much more to be done.
Our view remains that change is best achieved by working collaboratively with others so that we can continue to ask the right questions, while always being mindful that we have our own challenges in this country.
The president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, was asked this month about the deaths of workers in Qatar. Every one is tragic and we acknowledge that, he said. But he warned against a boycott saying: Our position at Fifa has always been, and will always be, engagement and dialogue is the only and the best way forward to make changes happen."

So much so that a qualification process some thought might never happen began this week.
Thousands of migrant workers have died in Qatar since Sepp Blatter gifted them their Fifa-approved golden ticket. The states own official figures for deaths specifically related to construction for World Cup stadiums are small  three work-related and 34 non?work-related fatalities, it says  but the danger in this building boom feels present and very real.
In 2018 the Norwegian journalist Håvard Melnæs visited Qatar for Josimar magazine and, in a move that would almost certainly have been stymied had local officialdom got wind of it, interviewed an obliging construction worker from the Czech Republic. The site foreman revealed he had witnessed so many deaths he had actually become inured to them. He recalled one accident in which a wall had collapsed, killing six workers and severely injuring eight more. The dead and wounded were immediately collected by ambulances and driven away, he said. Then we kept working, as if nothing had happened. Qatar says legal action was taken over this incident.
Like most of Qatars two million-strong migrant workforce, the labourers tasked with clearing the rubble which temporarily entombed their colleagues are likely to have paid big fees they could not afford to recruitment agents. Many would have arrived to learn they were being paid far less than they had been promised, often doing different, more perilous jobs to the ones for which they had applied.
Domiciled in labour camps  some heavily guarded and with high concrete walls  they would have been bussed to work each morning at daybreak and forced to work long hours, six days a week in temperatures of up to 50C. Some, but not all, employers appear to observe the local law that designates the hottest hours during which you can hear your own skin crackle a rest period. The Qataris insist that companies found to be violating the laws on summer working hours or overtime payments are penalised.
Wages vary depending on work but mainly on nationality. Some workers earn as little as £130 a month, while all are prevented from seeking more lucrative employment elsewhere by the kafala sponsorship system. It isnt slavery, but the conditions appear to have sinister echoes of the stratification of apartheid-era South Africa. Readers of a certain age will recall the seriously dim international view that was taken of any touring parties who put money before morals and chose to compete there.
A country fabled for its habit of loudly trumpeting labour reforms then appearing to fail to act on them, Qatar appeared to take a small but significant step in the right direction last August by announcing labour reforms, including making it easier for workers to change jobs. A minimum monthly wage of £198.56 was also introduced last week. However, Migrant-Rights.org has now revealed that the 2020 reforms aimed at dismantling the kafala system are being reviewed by the states legislative body, the Shura Council.
Well aware of the revulsion and criticism their winning bid to host World Cup 2022 created 11 years ago, Qatars Supreme Committee of Delivery and Legacy, the organisation responsible for delivering the competition, has done everything in its power to discourage negative reporting ever since. A spokesperson for the committee told the Guardian: Preparations for the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East and Arab world have already brought significant benefits to workers on SC [supreme committee] and non-SC projects in Qatar. But the sense that much more could have been done to help them remains.
So far so depressing, but in Norway a storm of indignation has been whipped up and is spreading. Recently, the top-flight club Tromsø issued a statement voicing their disgust at the corruption and modern slavery surrounding the Qatar World Cup and called on the Norwegian Football Federation to boycott the competition. Their appeal has since been echoed by several other high profile Eliteserien teams. These are bold calls, coming as they do from clubs and supporters whose success-starved national football team are currently spearheaded by a player as gifted as Erling Haaland. Whether or not those who run Norwegian football will pay any heed remains to be seen but it will be intriguing to see if clubs and fans elsewhere follow their lead. On Wednesday night, Norways players wore T-shirts flagging up human rights abuses before their qualifier against Gibraltar. Earlier in the day, the England defender John Stones answered questions about Qatar in a pre-match press conference.
This week the Dutch Football Association issued a statement in which it condemned human rights abuses in Qatar but said it will not boycott the World Cup, promising instead to take its corporate responsibilities seriously and participate in a socially responsible way. It claims to have partly based its decision on advice from various human rights groups who claim a boycott would lead to already impoverished workers further losing out. The English FA has yet to take a stance on the issue of migrant workers in Qatar but seems likely to adopt a similar party line to the Dutch, which would almost certainly be widely supported by fans.
A boycott seems unthinkable  if recent history at Manchester City and Newcastle United is any sort of guide, football supporters seem prepared to look the other way as far as human rights abuses are concerned if the alternative is the possibility of on-field success. While most national governing bodies, footballers and fans would almost certainly claim to find the dangers and indignities visited upon migrant workers in Qatar abhorrent, their reservoirs of empathy are  perhaps understandably  not bottomless. Following our moral compass and railing against obvious discrimination is all very well until it threatens to derail the possibility of travelling to and winning the World Cup.

There has been a debate in Norway in the past few weeks about whether the Norwegian Football Federation should boycott the 2022 World Cup in Qatar because of the poor working conditions for migrant workers in the country and human rights concerns.
The top-flight club Tromsø started the discussion by stating Norway should boycott the tournament and several other clubs have since followed suit.
Before the World Cup qualifier against Gibraltar the Norway captain, Martin Ødedegaard, hinted that the players would make some kind of statement before the game and when the coach, Ståle Solbakken, met the media 80 minutes before the game he was wearing a T-shirt with the message Respect  on and off the pitch.
The players wore the same message during warmup before swapping to the one saying Human rights  on and off the pitch. Solbakken told Norwegian TV2: This is a little bit what we have been talking about, to put the focus on some of that that has been a discussion off the pitch. The boys were keen to do this and I am here as an example of that.
Norway went on to win the match 3-0, thanks to goals from Alexander Sørloth, Kristian Thorstvedt and Jonas Svensson."

migrant workers have died in Qatar since World Cup awarded","More than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup 10 years ago, the Guardian can reveal.
The findings, compiled from government sources, mean an average of 12 migrant workers from these five south Asian nations have died each week since the night in December 2010 when the streets of Doha were filled with ecstatic crowds celebrating Qatars victory.
Data from India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka revealed there were 5,927 deaths of migrant workers in the period 20112020. Separately, data from Pakistans embassy in Qatar reported a further 824 deaths of Pakistani workers, between 2010 and 2020.
The total death toll is significantly higher, as these figures do not include deaths from a number of countries which send large numbers of workers to Qatar, including the Philippines and Kenya. Deaths that occurred in the final months of 2020 are also not included.
In the past 10 years, Qatar has embarked on an unprecedented building programme, largely in preparation for the football tournament in 2022. In addition to seven new stadiums, dozens of major projects have been completed or are under way, including a new airport, roads, public transport systems, hotels and a new city, which will host the World Cup final.
While death records are not categorised by occupation or place of work, it is likely many workers who have died were employed on these World Cup infrastructure projects, says Nick McGeehan, a director at FairSquare Projects, an advocacy group specialising in labour rights in the Gulf. A very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup, he said.
A year on from the start of the worlds biggest health crisis, we now face a human rights pandemic. Covid-19 has exposed the inequalities and fragilities of health and political systems and allowed authoritarian regimes to impose drastic curbs on rights and freedoms, using the virus as a pretext for restricting free speech and stifling dissent.
Rights and Freedom is a new Guardian reporting series to investigate and expose human rights abuses at this critical time, and elevate the voices of people on the frontlines, fighting back for themselves and their communities.
There have been 37 deaths among workers directly linked to construction of World Cup stadiums, of which 34 are classified as non-work related by the events organising committee. Experts have questioned the use of the term because in some cases it has been used to describe deaths which have occurred on the job, including a number of workers who have collapsed and died on stadium construction sites.
The findings expose Qatars failure to protect its 2 million-strong migrant workforce, or even investigate the causes of the apparently high rate of death among the largely young workers.
Behind the statistics lie countless stories of devastated families who have been left without their main breadwinner, struggling to gain compensation and confused about the circumstances of their loved ones death.
Ghal Singh Rai from Nepal paid nearly £1,000 in recruitment fees for his job as a cleaner in a camp for workers building the Education City World Cup stadium. Within a week of arriving, he killed himself.
Another worker, Mohammad Shahid Miah, from Bangladesh, was electrocuted in his worker accommodation after water came into contact with exposed electricity cables.
In India, the family of Madhu Bollapally have never understood how the healthy 43-year old died of natural causes while working in Qatar. His body was found lying on his dorm room floor.
Qatars grim death toll is revealed in long spreadsheets of official data listing the causes of death: multiple blunt injuries due to a fall from height; asphyxia due to hanging; undetermined cause of death due to decomposition.
But among the causes, the most common by far is so-called natural deaths, often attributed to acute heart or respiratory failure.
Based on the data obtained by the Guardian, 69% of deaths among Indian, Nepali and Bangladeshi workers are categorised as natural. Among Indians alone, the figure is 80%.
The Guardian has previously reported that such classifications, which are usually made without an autopsy, often fail to provide a legitimate medical explanation for the underlying cause of these deaths.
In 2019 it found that Qatars intense summer heat is likely to be a significant factor in many worker deaths. The Guardians findings were supported by research commissioned by the UNs International Labour Organization which revealed that for at least four months of the year workers faced significant heat stress when working outside.
A report from Qatar governments own lawyers in 2014 recommended that it commission a study into the deaths of migrant workers from cardiac arrest, and amend the law to allow for autopsies  in all cases of unexpected or sudden death. The government has done neither.
Qatar continues to drag its feet on this critical and urgent issue in apparent disregard for workers lives, said Hiba Zayadin, Gulf researcher for Human Rights Watch. We have called on Qatar to amend its law on autopsies to require forensic investigations into all sudden or unexplained deaths, and pass legislation to require that all death certificates include reference to a medically meaningful cause of death, she said.
The Qatar government says that the number of deaths  which it does not dispute  is proportionate to the size of the migrant workforce and that the figures include white-collar workers who have died naturally after living in Qatar for many years. It also says that only 20 per cent of expatriates from the countries in question are employed in construction, and that work-related deaths in this sector accounted for fewer than 10 percent of fatalities within this group.
The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population. However, every lost life is a tragedy, and no effort is spared in trying to prevent every death in our country, the Qatari government said in a statement by a spokesperson.
The official added that all citizens and foreign nationals have access to free first-class healthcare, and that there has been a steady decline in the mortality rate among guest workers over the past decade due to health and safety reforms to the labour system.
Other significant causes of deaths among Indians, Nepalis and Bangladeshis are road accidents (12%), workplace accidents (7%) and suicide (7%).
Covid-related deaths, which have remained extremely low in Qatar, have not significantly affected the figures, with just over 250 fatalities among all nationalities.
The Guardians research has also highlighted the lack of transparency, rigour and detail in recording deaths in Qatar. Embassies in Doha and governments in labour-sending countries are reluctant to share the data, possibly for political reasons. Where statistics have been provided, there are inconsistencies between the figures held by different government agencies, and there is no standard format for recording the causes of death. One south-Asian embassy said they could not share data on the causes of death because they were only recorded by hand in a notebook.
There is a real lack of clarity and transparency surrounding these deaths, said May Romanos, Gulf researcher for Amnesty International. There is a need for Qatar to strengthen its occupational health and safety standards.
The committee organising the World Cup in Qatar, when asked about the deaths on stadium projects, said: We deeply regret all of these tragedies and investigated each incident to ensure lessons were learned. We have always maintained transparency around this issue and dispute inaccurate claims around the number of workers who have died on our projects.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Fifa, footballs world governing body, said it is fully committed to protecting the rights of workers on Fifa projects. With the very stringent health and safety measures on site  the frequency of accidents on Fifa World Cup construction sites has been low when compared to other major construction projects around the world, they said, without providing evidence.
The heading and sub-heading on this article were amended on 2 March 2021 to clarify that the figure for 6,500 deaths covers the 10-year period since Qatar was awarded the World Cup. The article text was amended on 8 and 18 March 2021 to include further comments from the Qatar government relating to the percentage of expatriates employed in construction and work-related deaths in this sector.

In its report, Equidem describes how thousands of workers have been dismissed without notice, put on reduced wages or unpaid leave, denied outstanding salary and end of service payments, or forced to pay for their own flights home.
The reports findings appear to amount to wage theft on an unprecedented scale, leaving worker after worker destitute, short of food and unable to send money home during the pandemic, in one of the richest countries in the world.
I came here to work for my family, not to be a beggar living on my own, said a cleaner from Bangladesh, who said he had not received his salary for four months.
In separate research, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre found that unpaid or delayed wages were cited by workers in 87% of cases of alleged labour abuse affecting almost 12,000 workers since 2016.
Around 2 million migrant workers  mostly from south Asia  work in Qatar, many on construction projects related to the 2022 World Cup.
Equidem praises some measures put in place by the Qatar government during the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the government made it mandatory for companies to continue to pay workers in quarantine or government-imposed isolation, and set up a £625m loan scheme to help companies do so, but the report warns of widespread failure to comply with this and other regulations.
The government later permitted companies that had stopped operating due to Covid restrictions to put workers on unpaid leave or terminate their contracts as long as they complied with requirements of the labour law, including giving a notice period and paying outstanding benefits.
The report highlights a number of companies that exploited or ignored this directive. Up to 2,000 workers employed by one construction company were laid off on the spot, workers claim. Most did not receive their outstanding salary or end of service settlement, a payment equivalent to three weeks salary for each full year of work.
Many migrant workers are in an extremely vulnerable position with no real ability to assert their rights or seek remedy for violations, says the report.
Mustafa Qadri, the director of Equidem, said the lack of a lawful right to organise or join a trade union has been particularly damaging. It has prevented workers from having a seat at the table with government and employers to negotiate an equitable share of funds, he said.
The report describes similar findings in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as policies in response to the pandemic which amount to racial discrimination. In both countries, the authorities required private companies to continue to provide wages and benefits to nationals, but allowed them to reduce wages or stop paying non-nationals.
In a statement, the Qatar government said its response to the pandemic, has been driven by the highest international standards of public health policy and the protection of human rights.
The government has provided free testing and treatment and said, employers failing to pay their staff on time or withholding end of service payments have faced disciplinary action, including heavy fines and bans that prevent them from operating."

The human rights organisation said the amounts owed to workers and staff by Qatar Meta Coats, a design and construction company subcontracted for work on the £685m 60,000-seat Al Bayt stadium, ranged from around 8,000 Qatari riyals (£1,720) to 60,000 (£12,900).
Some employees have now started to receive part of what they were owed after Amnesty raised the QMC case with the Qatari authorities, Fifa, and Qatars World Cup organisers this week. However no worker has yet received all of their unpaid wages.
This case is the latest damning illustration of how easy it still is to exploit workers in Qatar, even when they are building one of the crown jewels of the World Cup, said Amnestys head of economic and social justice, Steve Cockburn.
For years we have been urging Qatar to reform the system, but clearly change has not come fast enough. It shouldnt take an Amnesty investigation for workers to be paid what they are owed.
Amnesty also criticised Fifa for not doing more to put pressure on Qatar. If, over the past 10 years, Fifa had held its World Cup partners to account, and used its clout to push Qatar to fully reform its systems, we wouldnt be hearing the same tales of workers suffering with only two-and-a-half years until kick-off, added Cockburn.
Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy told Amnesty that it first learned of QMCs payment problems in July 2019 and had since taken various measures to try to remedy the situation , including meeting the companys management, blacklisting it from future contracts and informing the Ministry of Labour.

However Amnesty said it was still unacceptable that many workers had gone from September 2019 to March 2020 without pay.
Although recent payments will provide some welcome relief for workers, Qatars World Cup organisers told us they had known about the salary delays since July 2019, added Cockburn. This raises the question of why Qatar allowed workers to continue working for months without pay.
QMC told Amnesty the payment delays were due to financial difficulties and said it was trying to resolve them."

With less than 1,000 days to go until the tournament kicks off, workers said it was business as usual as construction continued at a relentless pace.
Buses packed full of labourers could be seen heading to work, while workers told the Guardian they continue to endure long shifts with only limited health checks in place.
As arguments continue in the UK over whether it is safe for construction workers to turn up to work, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Tuesday that essential building work can continue as long as workers remain two metres apart.
Such a condition would be nearly impossible to meet in Qatar, where workers live in crowded labour camps, sharing dormitories, often with eight to 10 others, and are transported to work in company buses crammed with up to 60 people.
While Qatar is not yet in lockdown, and work in some sectors continues, low-wage migrant workers are particularly vulnerable, given how closely they interact with others in labour camps and on the job.
Workers say they have no choice but to show up, compelled both by their employers and the urgent need to earn money for their families back home.
I worry a lot about getting the virus, but I need the money, said one Kenyan construction worker, not employed on a World Cup project, who works 14-hour shifts. He said he wears gloves and a mask at work but it is not enough. Only God is enough, he added.
A Nepalese labourer building a car park said his blood pressure is checked before each shift. I use a face mask, which I bought myself. Those who dont have a mask cover their mouth with a piece of cloth, he said.
Last week, the Qatari authorities announced a ban on all forms of gatherings  including but not limited to the Corniche, public parks, beaches and social gatherings, but despite an almost total shutdown of gyms, cinemas, shopping malls and banks, the ruling appears not to apply to construction workers and others in the private sector.
Notices on the governments social media sites urging people to avoid public spaces and gatherings provoked an angry response, with one user writing: How will construction workers maintain social distancing?  No one cares about our safety  Do you think we dont want to live? Do you think we dont want to see our families?
Another wrote that he was on the site for nine hours a day, adding: We are not robots. We are not immune to the virus.
Migrant workers in Qatar, and across the Gulf, are not allowed to change jobs without their employers permission, a system some rights groups have described as a form of modern slavery. Legislation to end the practice was unveiled in October but has not yet come into force.
Most migrant workers pay large recruitment fees, some as high as £4,000, to secure jobs in Qatar. Many find their salaries are less than they were promised. Low pay and late pay are commonplace, but workers are reluctant to complain for fear they will lose their jobs.
It is hard for employees in any context to refuse to go to work, but in systems like Qatar, where employers have extreme levels of control over workers, it would be particularly risky, said James Lynch, a director at Fair/Square Research and Projects and an expert on migrant workers in Qatar. New migration to Qatar has been halted as a result of the pandemic, so the impact of losing your job is now even worse than it would be anyway.
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Qatar has now topped 500, with the vast majority migrant workers. The figure is the third highest in the Gulf, after Iran and Saudi Arabia.
In a statement, the Qatar governments communications office said the wellbeing of everyone in Qatar is of paramount concern. Testing for coronavirus is free for all and anyone who tests positive receives high-quality care at no cost, they said.
The government is in close coordination with employers to ensure that their health and safety is maintained. This includes working with companies to raise awareness for workers around preventive actions, including hygiene, sterilisation and cleaning of sites and buses, as well as controlled entry and exit to workplaces, the statement said.
The supreme committee, the body organising the World Cup, has been approached for comment.

Police are guarding the perimeter of a huge zone within the Industrial Area, leaving thousands of workers trapped in squalid, over-crowded camps, where the virus can spread rapidly. No one can enter or leave, say workers who live in the area, many of whom had been working on Fifa World Cup 2022 infrastructure projects.
Inside the quarantined camps, workers describe an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.
Sources inside the camp told The Guardian that some workers were being put on unpaid leave until further notice, with only food and accommodation covered.
The situation is getting worse each day. Workers from camp 1 to camp 32 are in lockdown. My friends who live there are in extreme panic, said one worker from Bangladesh.
A Nepali worker who lives inside the area under lockdown, said they are barred from leaving it. We are not allowed to walk in groups or eat in a tea shop. But you can still buy food and take it home. Im worried about my family back home. There wont be anyone to take care of them if anything happens to me, he said.
The situation is really tense here, said another Nepali worker.
The lockdown appears to have been enforced after the government announced 238 cases of the virus among expatriate workers on 11 March. A further 113 cases, most of which appear to be linked to that outbreak, were identified over the following five days.
Yet, while the World Cup host nation has shut down almost all public spaces in the face of the global pandemic, some construction workers who have not tested positive for Covid-19 say they continue to be forced to work, with little more than a temperature check before each shift.
The number of infections in the Gulf is growing rapidly with over 1,200 reported by Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE.
Dohas Industrial Area is vast expanse of warehouses, factories and workers accommodation about half an hour from the Qatari capital. It is home to hundreds of thousands of men, most of whom live in cramped dormitories, often packed eight or 10 to a room, making it extremely difficult to stop the transmission of the virus. Communal kitchens and toilets shared by scores of men are often unsanitary and caked in grime.
How can workers protect themselves when most camps do not have running water and no hand sanitisers? How can you do social distancing in a camp where thousands of men are living side by side? None of the usual advice works in a labour camp, said Vani Saraswathi, the associate editor of migrant-rights.org, who lived in Qatar for 17 years.
Some workers said they had taken matters into their own hands. We are doing everything to keep ourselves safe. The camp was a little dirty, so we cleaned everything, changed the bed sheets, and used spray to kill the germs, said one.
There are around 2 million migrant workers in Qatar  mostly from south Asia and east Africa  who make up 95% of the working population. The number of migrants has increased rapidly in recent years as the country gears up to host the World Cup in 2022.
Conditions are similar across the Gulf, where millions of migrant workers are the lifeblood of the economy. In Bahrain, 800 workers are reportedly in quarantine.
The picture is less clear in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, where the authorities have released little information about how the virus is affecting migrant workers.
This week the Qatari government announced a number of policies to boost its economy, including 75 billion Qatari rials (around £18bn) in incentives and support for the private sector.
Despite the measures, Saraswathi warned that migrant workers may face the brunt of the economic fallout of the virus, in a country where low pay and late pay are commonplace.
The government should never have kept workers in such appalling conditions, but the least they can do now is ensure workers get their wages on time. They must keep an eye open for wage deductions and delays, she said. If workers cant send money home now, their families will face real hardships just when they need money the most.
Some workers have praised the governments response. A Nepali labourer said he was immediately taken to hospital after he reported flu-like symptoms, and discharged only after tests for the coronavirus came out negative.Qatar is doing everything in its power to stop the spread of the virus. Workers are also doing everything to support the government to contain the virus by obeying the rules and regulations as they are for our common good, he said.
Other workers were too afraid to speak to the Guardian, fearing they would be deported for talking to the media.
All countries in the Gulf have now barred entry to all foreigners, leaving tens of thousands of migrants who were due to travel to the region for work, in limbo in their own countries.
Migrant workers typically borrow large sums at high interest rates to pay recruitment agents to secure their jobs, but now face the prospect of being unable to repay them. Others who have travelled back to their home countries for a visit are unable to return, leaving them unclear if their jobs will still be waiting for them when the virus abates.
The Nepal governments unprecedented decision on Wednesday to ban its citizens flying home from the Gulf and other countries badly hit by the virus has left millions of Nepali migrants effectively stranded overseas.
The announcement drew criticism from Ganesh Gurung, a migration expert from Nepal, who said, I am surprised by the decision. What happens to a Nepali who does not have a visa or money to live? That is a total disaster  Migrant workers are the economic heroes of Nepal, but when there is a vulnerable situation, they are prohibited from coming home. It is a violation of their human rights.
The Qatar government confirmed the majority of cases of coronavirus in the country have been located in the Industrial Area.Every effort is being made to prevent the spread of the disease in Qatar and protect every member of the population. As a result, some areas of Qatar have been cordoned off to contain the virus, the governments communications office said in a statement.Where quarantines are in place, the [relevant authorities] are working closely with employers to ensure the welfare and medical needs of the residents are met. Food, water, masks and hand sanitiser are being regularly distributed. In coordination with companies, the ministry is ensuring that workers daily needs are met and salaries paid on schedule.

ceviche, a private helicopter pickup from the beach  the Instagram account of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels has unfolded like an escapist travelogue epic in recent weeks, as his adventures in Latin America have taken their place in his dizzying globetrotting itinerary. But there is one photograph he hasnt been so keen to share with his 730,000 followers: of him standing next to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazils far-right president, with the uneasy smile of a man whos just secured his latest big commission from another unsavoury despot, in this case one who has boasted of being proudly homophobic.
According to a statement from Brazils ministry of tourism, Ingels visited Brazil to tour several states and discuss strategies for developing sustainable tourism on its north-east coast, in partnership with the Nômade Group, which recently built an eco-conscious luxury resort in Tulum, the ruins of a Mayan walled city in Mexico.
Theyve pioneered this incredible barefoot light-impact environment, says Ingels, speaking by phone from Santiago in Chile. Its a model of tourism development that doesnt replace the forest or the sand, but strengthens and preserves it. Its a very welcome alternative to the kind of high-rise hotels that spring up on the beach in many places.
Such an eco-conscious approach doesnt seem to chime with Bolsonaros reactionary regime. Since he came to power last January, Brazils president has confirmed every fear that he would be a Trump of the tropics. He has appointed climate-change deniers to prominent roles, dismissed deforestation statistics as fake news, and sacked the head of the institute that undertook the research. Last year, he played down the worst fires for a decade in the Amazon, calling the global outcry the result of deceitful media hype. He once said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one, rails against Brazil becoming a gay tourism paradise, and his recent introduction of abstinence-based sex education has been likened to going back 40 years.
So what is Ingels, self-styled seer of a progressive liberal world, doing with such a figure? Im happy to share the ideas and ideals that I hold with any government willing to listen, he says, especially if they hold different beliefs. If theres a responsibility that comes from the creative platform weve created, it is to use that platform to change the world for the better. He says that the political leaders of the north-eastern Brazilian states they visited are from the opposite end of the political spectrum to Bolsonaro, adding that ultimately great ideas transcend political parties.
Over the last few years, Ingels has gone from being the mischievous young designer of mountain-shaped apartment blocks on the outskirts of Copenhagen, to becoming the go-to celebrity architect for some of the worlds biggest corporations. Now 45, he has recently popped up as the face of everything from Hyperloop to WeWork, and is currently designing a city-sized HQ for Google in California. Then theres his actual city for Toyota in Japan, right under Mount Fuji.But most audacious of all, he tells me, is the masterplan he is now working on for the whole of Earth  provisionally titled The Masterplanet.
His status as big techs cheeky go-to boy is perhaps what also makes him so attractive to a growing client base of autocrats. Both kinds of patron share an insatiable desire to shape every aspect of the world to their exacting vision, be it a future of autonomous vehicles, or a world where the Amazon rainforest is seen as a virgin that should be exploited, as the climate-crisis-denying Bolsonaro has put it.
BIG, which stand for Bjarke Ingels Group, is also engaged in several major projects in Saudi Arabia, including a new leisure resort city called Qiddiya, 45km from Riyadh, billed as a new capital of entertainment; theres also a confidential project that Ingels describes as a human-made ecosystem that is as close to a utopia as you dare imagine. Would this be a utopia that had  in accordance with Saudi law  flogging for drunkenness, amputation for robbery and extrajudicial killing for anyone criticising the regime?
I do sincerely believe that the urban transformation of Saudi Arabia that were taking part in is part of paving a path to a clearly needed social and cultural reform of the country, says Ingels. Following the state-sanctioned murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, he says his office debated whether to pull out of the projects (as Norman Foster did), but decided they could do more good by continuing to engage.
The road to ethical impact as an architect is to [propose] the future we want to companies and governments, he says, even if they have different views. We have to embrace our differences if we want to create a future that is different. Its easy to dismiss his words as naively optimistic, like a TED Talk for dictators, but he has a point  architecture and cities long outlast the ideologies that created them. But they do also reinforce the politics of their sponsors.
Ingels is by no means alone. French architect Jean Nouvel has become the darling of the autocratic Gulf monarchs, designing the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the National Museum of Qatar and now a luxury resort in Saudi Arabia. He has in the past dismissed the issue of human rights as an old question, echoing the response of the late Zaha Hadid, architect of the vulva-shaped stadium in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. I have nothing to do with the workers, Hadid said when challenged about the fact that hundreds of migrant workers had died on construction projects in Qatar. I think thats an issue the government  if theres a problem  should pick up. Its not my duty as an architect to look at it.
Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas was equally frank about his work in China, when asked about designing the enormous HQ of China Central Television, the chief organ of state propaganda. A position of resistance seems somehow ornamental, he said. On our own, we can at most have good intentions. But we cannot represent the public good without the larger entity, such as the state. Revealing the allure of totalitarian regimes, he added: To make matters worse, the more radical, innovative and brotherly our sentiments, the more we architects need a strong sponsor.
Sharing Ingels belief that architects can effect change from within, Jacques Herzog compared his work on the Birds Nest  the 2008 Beijing Olympic stadium  to designing a Trojan horse. He told German newspaper Der Spiegel that only an idiot would have turned down the project on moral grounds, adding that his firms design creates all kinds of niches and meeting places around the edge of its latticework structure, hidden away from government surveillance.
This is a recurring theme. Whenever the topic of ethics comes up, most architects who work in repressive climates believe their projects can transcend the abuses of the host regimes and make everyday life a bit better for the people who live there. The dilemma is whether to boycott or engage. Should a well-intentioned architect avoid working with any system they disagree with  or hope that the conditions of workers, or freedom of speech, might be improved by using their platform to raise these issues?
Its just surface rhetoric, says Jeremy Till, dean of Central Saint Martins art school in London and author of Architecture Depends, which examined the disciplines relationship with money and power. The idea that a single building is going to be emancipatory for a whole totalitarian state is ridiculous.
Till was involved in the RIBAs recent ethics report, which asserted an unequivocal commitment to placing public interest, social purpose and sustainable development at the heart of RIBA activities. He is particularly critical of some of the practices that have signed the recent Architects Declare manifesto, pledging to advocate for low-carbon, eco-friendly development  while also designing airports. There are some architects who abdicate their responsibility, he says. I do understand that  but then they shouldnt virtue-signal by signing up to these agreements.
As for Ingels latest foray into the tropics, Till doesnt hold out much hope. Its a fantasy that by doing a nice greenwash project in the north-east of Brazil, you are going to save the nation from fascism.
Ingels differs. The proof will be in the pudding, he says. I dont know if were going to succeed in bringing positive change, or come up with a great alternative to the traditional developments that destroy the landscape and debase the local community. But we will definitely not succeed if we dont even try."

The Brazilians obliged and went off in search of somewhere else to drink, security returned to the main entrance and check-in proceeded without further incident, but reservations over Qatars ability to stage a World Cup  never mind its suitability  had begun. Six days at the Club World Cup have not dispelled them.
Qatar is a desert under construction with a global workforce mobilised to build eight stadiums and new infrastructure in time for 2022. The results from the cheap migrant labour are extremely impressive. The new metro system is immaculate  and 40p to ride in a spacious carriage that could pass for first-class in Britain  the completed and even half-built stadia look spectacular and so, too, the hotel complexes that are rising up along the Gulf coast.
But a World Cup is not just about 64 matches and the experience for those visiting Qatar between 21 November and 18 December 2022 promises to be unlike anything encountered before. As it does for the World Cups Muslim hosts and hopes that fans of 31 other nations will respect their culture and beliefs.
The Club World Cup has been used by Fifa as a dry run for the main event in 2022 and next year when the tournament returns to Qatar. Dry run being a completely inappropriate phrase in a country with strict controls on the consumption of alcohol. Hotel bars are the usual place to drink  for around £12 a pint  providing the drinker is a resident or has a passport to hand. Not ideal when the masses descend in 2022.
The same applies to the polite metro staff and their requests, in the pre-season friendly atmosphere of the Liverpool v Monterrey semi?final on Wednesday, for supporters to queue single-file at the ticket barriers when exiting Sport City station. Again, it is hard to imagine fans of certain countries at the World Cup being so obliging or as patient as the fans who queued for an hour to gain entry to the stadium as a result of stringent security checks.
A fan zone was set up for the Club World Cup at Doha Sports Park  £5 a pint  with supporters bussed to matches at Khalifa International Stadium almost an hour away. More will be in operation during the World Cup and local organisers appear confident these will keep supporters occupied outside of matches. That seems optimistic, although the fan zone does demonstrate the willingness of Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) to cooperate with fans and relax laws.
Hassan Al Thawadi, secretary general of SC, visited Liverpool as part of the organisations preparations for the Club World Cup. SC members met Liverpool supporters group Spirit of Shankly and LGBT+ group Kop Outs when, as the SOS chair, Joe Blott, put it, challenging discussions were held over Qatars treatment of migrant workers, its human rights record and ban on homosexuality.
They engaged with us, unlike Uefa or the FA, Blott says. Weve been guinea pigs to an extent. The Football Supporters Association and Football Supporters Europe are keen to find out what will happen at the World Cup and we have let them know everything we have been doing.
It has been incredibly positive. We raised our concerns about workers rights and human rights and LGBT issues and how safe it would be for our fans over there. It was forthright and they said they wanted to change and were taking steps.
Practical measures taken for the Club World Cup, Blott says, include: Sensible, light-touch policing. If someone walks out of a hotel with a pint dont arrest them but let them know its not allowed. The price of alcohol. A pint can be £15 (due to a 100% excise tax introduced this year) but they listened to us and reduced it to £5 in the fan zone, which is incredible. And please dont spike prices for hotels and airlines, as happens with Uefa finals. Madrid was ridiculous, Liverpool fans were fleeced again, but there hasnt been a spike in Qatar. The prices for flights and hotels are the same as they were this time last year.
SOS contacted SC last week after four Liverpool fans discovered they had been scammed over flights and tickets to the Club World Cup. The SC provided return flights for the final to those affected.
North of Doha work continues on the Lusail Stadium, an 80,000-seat venue that will stage the opening game of the World Cup and the final. When the tournament is over in a country with a smaller land mass than Northern Ireland, the stadium will be no more. It will be converted into a community hub of retail space, accommodation and community facilities. Of the other seven stadiums, one will be dismantled and shipped to Africa while 20,000 seats from each of the remaining six will be removed and given to stadiums in developing countries.
One message heard regularly this past week is that the impending end of the kafala system, which ties migrant workers to sponsorship by their employer and prevents them moving jobs or leaving the country without approval, will have a ripple effect throughout the Gulf region.
Tamim El Abed, project manager at Lusail Stadium, says: We have put in place a lot of measures that were never seen before in the region. Where they [workers] didnt previously have a worker welfare officer, now they do. Where they didnt previously have a way of reimbursing people for fees paid to middlemen, now they do. Where they previously withheld peoples passports, now they dont.
Ultimately you can only go on this journey with the private sector. You can write and enforce as many laws as you want but if the other side doesnt implement them you have a breakdown in the process. Hopefully, by the end of this journey this is something that will be taken for granted and theyll continue doing business the way we have established. We hope."

The 2022 World Cup has been dogged by criticism of its hosts kafala system, which ties migrant workers to so-called sponsorship by their employer, meaning they cannot move jobs or leave the country without the employers approval.
In an interview in the Qatari capital, Doha, Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the supreme committee organising the event, said he wanted reforms to apply not just to workers employed on World Cup projects but across Qatar and more widely.
There are already signs of reforms being picked up in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, he said.
The International Labour Organisation has said it expects the reforms to be implemented in January.
The abolition of kafala, he said, would mean every person living in the country has the freedom to move from one job to another and can live their lives, change jobs whenever they want and leave the country as they want.
Qatar says it is also planning labour market reforms, including introducing elected workers welfare forums to raise complaints with employers, and a more than 50% rise in the minimum wage.
Qatar has announced it is planning labour market reforms, including introducing workers welfare forums to raise complaints with employers and a substantial rise in the minimum wage. International sources say the rise is likely to be over 50%. It would be the first Gulf State to apply a national uniform minimum wage that disregards nationality and will not be just applicable to construction workers. Thawadi would not be drawn on the specifics. The rise in the minimum wage is something I am excited about, but the details of where they are at I am not entirely familiar with or aware.
All Gulf states make heavy use of low-paid migrant labour, often from India. In the case of Qatar, the indigenous population now makes up only 10% of the countrys total of 2.8 million people. The Indian population of 700,000 alone dwarfs the number of locals.
A report by Amnesty International in September said thousands of migrant workers were still being exploited in Qatar despite repeated promises to improve workers rights.
Dismantling Qatars exploitative labour market  with its echoes of slavery, which was only abolished there in the 1950s  could have huge repercussions not just for Qatars rapidly evolving society but for Gulf economies as a whole.
Thawadi claimed that some of the criticism levelled at Qatar since it won the right to stage the World Cup a decade ago had been ill-informed, cynical or even vicious.
This week Qatar is hosting Liverpool FC among other clubs in the Club World Cup, a tournament seen as a chance to test newly built infrastructure including a 37-station metro system, match scheduling and the overall fan experience.
Octobers World Athletics Championships in Doha were marked by rows and rows of empty seats and complaints from athletes about a lack of atmosphere. Thawadi said lessons have been learned and with 1.5 million fans due to visit for the World Cup, lack of enthusiasm would not be an issue.
Football and the World Cup can break down stereotypes. The passion for this game like no other creates a bond and bridges gaps, he said.
World Cup organisers have repeatedly warned fans that they will have to be respectful of Qatars local laws and customs, including a ban on homosexuality.
Thawadi, a football fan who admires Liverpool and what he called its leftwing fanbase, said meetings with community groups such as Spirit of Shankly and Kop Outs, an LGBT supporters club, had averted an embarrassing boycott of this weeks event. Nevertheless, he said LGBT fans would be welcome only if they refrained from public displays of affection.
He said alcohol would be on sale in specified fan zones and in hotels but not on street corners. Alcohol is not part of our culture but hospitality is.
A sin tax has raised the price of beer to £10 a pint, an issue Thawadi said needed addressing. But he regarded such matters as a two-way street. Let us try to understand each other as human beings, he said. We are a conservative culture, not a closed culture.
Houtan Homayounpour, the Doha chief for ILO, a UN employment rights agency that has been working on reforms with the Qatar government since 2017, said progress was being made but there were many more milestones to pass.
Homayounpour cited the heat-related death toll among migrant workers, a lack of autopsies and delays in payment of wages as areas of concern.
The flow of information to the families of dead and injured workers has been mixed. For instance, the family of Zac Cox, a British worker who died when he fell from a gantry, struggled for many months to extract information on the circumstances of his death. Only after relentless pressure did Thawadis committee set up a British judge-led inquiry.
Thawadi said he was committed to implementing the inquirys findings. We dont want Zacs death to go without us learning or contributing to the welfare of other people, he said.
Thawadi, 41, a former law student at Sheffield University, said the labour reforms were intended not just to help Qatar survive the current glare of publicity. None of the work we have done is to satisfy the spotlight or the critics, he said.
Our nations commitment is that these will be sustainable changes. Yes, some people have criticised the pace, but you need to build the foundations before you live in a house.
This article was amended on 21 December 2019. The original suggested that Hassan al-Thawadi said the labour market reforms would be implemented in January. It is actually the International Labour Organisation that has said it expects the changes to take place next month."

watch the Fifa Club World Cup next week, it will be easy to forget the thousands of workers from the poorest countries in the region who have toiled for years to construct its glittering buildings.
When they take their seats at the Khalifa International Stadium, where Liverpool will play their semi-final match, they may not realise that scores of workers who refurbished the stadium were housed in filthy, overcrowded accommodation with an ever-present stench of raw sewage.
There will be no announcements to inform them that these men were paid less than promised, their passports were confiscated and they were unable to change jobs or quit the country, leaving some vulnerable to forced labour, a modern form of slavery, according to Amnesty International.
And looking up at the soaring stadium arches, there will be nothing to remind them that British construction worker Zac Cox fell to his death here in 2017.
Fifa announced on Saturday that the original venue for the game on 18 December, the dazzling new Education City Stadium, was not match ready.
But the Education City stadium also has a story of death and indifference at the highest levels of the game.
In June, a 24-year-old labourer from Nepal, Rupchandra Rumba, died gasping for breath in a squalid labour camp on the outskirts of Doha. He was working as a scaffolder at Education City Stadium.
Nearly six months after he died, and more than two months since the Guardian first revealed her plight, Rumbas wife, Nirmala Pakrin, has still not received any compensation from Qatar.
Sitting in her small room on the edge of Kathmandu, with photos of her husband on the walls, Pakrin says their six-year-old son, Niraj, is struggling to accept that his father is not coming home. He keeps asking: Wheres my dad? Why is he not calling? When will he come? she says.
In recent weeks, Pakrin says the director of the company that employed Rumba has been pressuring her to accept a pay-off of 7,000 Qatari rials (£1,460).
She says she feels afraid. Im concerned about my safety. He is using threatening language, she says.
Her brother, Pradip Pakrin, has dismissed the offer, saying: We have to fight for what is right. If we accept this, other families will suffer.
Nick McGeehan, a director of Fair/Square Projects and an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf, says: We appear to have this appalling situation where the families of workers who have died get derisory pay-offs or nothing at all from Qatar. McGeehan says the supreme committee, the body organising the Club World Cup, which starts on Wednesday, must take responsibility for the unexplained deaths of young men building its stadiums and compensate their families.
Liverpools CEO, Peter Moore, backed McGeehan in a letter on Tuesday, saying: We support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve.
Rumbas case is not a one-off. A total of 11 stadium workers died in 2018, according to the supreme committee. Of these deaths, 10 were described as non-work related, mostly attributed to sudden and unexplained heart or respiratory failure.
Data on the number of deaths of stadium workers in 2019 has not yet been published.
In the past year the Guardian has spoken to the families of five deceased stadium workers, including Rumba. Two say they have not received any compensation from Qatar. The other three only received compensation after the Guardian revealed their stories last year.
Poor people like us cannot hope to get compensation, says Johurul Islam, whose brother-in-law, Monjurul Islam, 28, a stadium worker from Bangladesh, died in August 2018. The Qatar government does not see us as human.
A spokesperson for the supreme committee said in a statement that in most cases compensation is only paid when a worker dies in a work-related accident. For non-work-related deaths, the supreme committee ensures our contractors pay final salaries [and] end of service benefits.
The Guardians findings will heap pressure on Liverpool, whose participation in the tournament has come under scrutiny from fans and human rights groups.
Minky Worden, a director at Human Rights Watch, believes Liverpools players and management should raise these abuses and demand reforms. Liverpool and other teams who play in Qatar should be aware that migrant workers have died to deliver the stadiums they are playing in, and at every opportunity speak up to insist that they are protected, she says.
Last month, in an interview for the clubs television channel, Moore said the club had gone to great lengths to understand the issues in Qatar. Were not a political organisation and its neither our place nor our ambition to go from country to country forcing our values and our beliefs on others, he added.
That may come as bad news to the family of Monjurul Islam. Johurul Islam says his brother-in-law paid a recruitment agent almost 500,000 Bangladeshi taka (£4,470) to secure his job in Qatar, a fee he could only afford by selling his land and taking out loans.
The agent promised him a lucrative salary, but his basic wage turned out to be just 600 Qatari rials a month (£125), says Johurul, far below the minimum wage, which itself is widely viewed as inadequate.
Johurul claims Monjuruls direct employer, one of Qatars largest construction companies, did not provide any compensation. They didnt even pay all the salary and allowances they owed him.
Johurul has been left devastated and confused by his death. I was very close to him. He had no illness. His death certificate said he died of a heart attack, but I still dont believe it, he says.
He has good reason to be suspicious. In October the Guardian revealed that in the vast majority of cases the Qatari authorities do not carry out postmortem examinations, making it impossible to accurately determine the cause of death.
Death certificates routinely state that workers die of respiratory or cardiac failure due to natural causes, but such explanations are meaningless, according to a British forensic pathologist, Stuart Hamilton.
All they say is someone died because they are dead. If a trainee pathologist presented me with these conclusions, I would tell them to go away and do some more work, says Hamilton.
The Guardian has found that many deaths of migrant workers in Qatar are likely to be linked to the extreme summer heat, which sees workers toiling in temperatures that regularly reach 45C.
The number of World Cup 2022 stadium workers who die each year are just a fraction of the total number of migrant worker deaths. Less than 2% of Qatars migrant workforce are employed at World Cup stadiums, but tens of thousands are working on infrastructure to support the World Cup in 2022, including hotel, rail and road construction.
Government data from India, Nepal and Bangladesh reveal the true scale of the death toll in Qatar. At least 1,025 workers from Nepal died between 2012 and 2017, 676 of them from causes deemed to be natural. In 2018, 149 Bangladeshi workers died, with 107 deaths classified as natural. Between 2012 and August 2018, 1,678 Indian workers died. Of these deaths, 1,345 were described as natural  a rate of four a week.
A spokesperson for the supreme committee said the health and safety of all its workers was of the utmost importance. The supreme committee investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities  to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident  the responsibility to investigate the underlying causes of non-work related death lies with the relevant local authorities.
In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson said Fifa, along with its local partners, is fully committed to safeguarding the rights of workers contributing to the Club World Cup and the 2022 World Cup. The spokesperson added that significant measures have been put in place at World Cup construction sites focusing on health and safety and workers protection.

Now fans travelling to the World Cup in Qatar are to be offered a very different experience after organisers confirmed they had chartered two cruise ships to serve as floating hotels in 2022.
The two vessels, hired from company MSC cruises, come with swimming pools, spas and a dinosaur playroom (for children). They also offer a combined capacity of 4,000 cabins. Rates are yet to be confirmed, although current MSC cruises run from £599 per person, and anyone hoping to experience life on the open waves will also be disappointed as both boats will be berthed throughout the tournament.
The deal was announced by Qatars supreme committee for delivery & legacy (SC) whose secretary-general, Hassan al-Thawadi, said: We are pleased to collaborate with MSC Cruises to deliver this unique accommodation option for fans in 2022. We are sure fans from all over the world will be excited at the prospect of staying onboard a cruise ship, with a fabulous view of West Bay, and fast access to all the stadiums and fan zones.
Qatar has long considered cruise ships a sustainable part of their plans to accommodate the 1m-plus fans projected to attend the tournament in a country with a population of 2.7m. The Gulf state has a shortage of pre-existing hotel rooms and as many as 40,000 fans are anticipated to end up sleeping on ships, with the vast majority taking up spare capacity on existing vessels. One other suggestion floated by the SC has included fans camping in the desert close to the stadiums.
The use of luxury vessels as impromptu accommodation will also serve as another sign of the excesses of Qatar 2022. Fifas decision to award the tournament to the Gulf state was beset by scandal, and the conditions endured by migrant labourers building stadiums for 2022 have been the subject of international outrage.
The World Athletic Championships, held earlier this year in Doha and part of the preparations for hosting the World Cup, were characterised by sparse crowds and a lack of atmosphere. There was also concern over the temperatures some athletes were expected to perform in. The World Cup has been rescheduled to winter to avoid temperatures that regularly top 40C."

The ILO, a UN employment rights agency which has been working on reforms with the Qatar government since 2017, said the Gulf countrys ministers had agreed to end kafala and also introduce a non-discriminatory minimum wage, the first in the Middle East.
Kafala ties workers to so-called sponsorship by their employer, meaning they cannot move jobs or leave the country without the employers approval. Human rights groups have campaigned for years to have kafala abolished across the Gulf, whose countries use millions of low-paid immigrant workers mostly from the Indian subcontinent. Fifas decision to locate the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has hugely increased scrutiny, and the Qatar government ultimately responded by signing a formal cooperation with the ILO promising to implement improvements.
The ILO said the latest reforms have been agreed unanimously by Qatars governing council of ministers, and must next pass through the countrys advisory (shura) council, before approval by the emir, Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, which it said is expected by January.
Describing the abolition of exit permits and no-objection certificates for workers moving jobs as marking the end of kafala, the ILO said: These steps will greatly support the rights of migrant workers, while contributing to a more efficient and productive economy.
The level of the minimum wage, a key reform given the low pay for migrant workers in Qatar, the worlds richest per-capita country, will be set later this year, the ILO said, and not discriminate between nationalities. Last year the Guardian reported that men working on World Cup stadium construction sites far from their families overseas, and living in labour camps, were being paid £40 per week in Qatar.
Human rights groups are increasingly raising the alarm about the dangers of working in the Gulf during a large part of the year when heat and humidity are intense. The Guardian reported this month that expert medical research into the high incidence of fatal heart attacks suffered by previously healthy young men working in Qatar had concluded that hundreds were caused by heat stress.
Last week the ILO announced the results of its own joint study with the Qatar government into heat stress, which concluded that people could safely work outdoors during prescribed hours, if appropriate precautionary measures were taken, which it was working to have passed into law.
Nicholas McGeehan, an advocate for improved human rights in the Gulf, said the announced employment reforms should be greeted with very cautious optimism until they are actually passed into law and implemented. He added that: Urgent action is needed on heat stress in Qatar, and in the Gulf generally."

The Amnesty investigation into three Qatari companies involved in construction and cleaning  Hamton International, Hamad bin Khaled bin Hamad and United Cleaning  found that at least 1,620 workers had submitted complaints after their wages were stopped for several months before their contracts were ended.
While some workers were eventually given part of their wages in exchange for dropping their cases, hundreds went home with nothing and none received compensation through a committee meant to settle labour disputes.
Among those quoted in the 52-page report  titled All work, no pay: The struggle of Qatars migrant workers for justice  was a Kenyan employee of United Cleaning who told Amnesty: For five months I had to live with very little food and no salary. My family was really affected. Tears come to my eyes when I remember where we used to go to find food  in the bins. The company owes me a lot of money which they refuse to pay me.
Amnesty believes the true scale of the problem is likely to be far bigger, with the US State Department estimating that more than 6,000 workers submitted complaints to Qatars new Committees for the Settlement of Labour Disputes last year.
The Qatari Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs told Amnesty it helped to negotiate many of the settlements and provided food and generators at workers camps. None of the three companies investigated responded when presented with Amnestys findings.
Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty Internationals deputy director of global issues, told the Guardian the report showed that for all Qatars promises of labour reform, the rhetoric did not match the reality on the ground.
Despite the significant promises of reform which Qatar has made ahead of the 2022 World Cup, it remains a playground for unscrupulous employers, he said. Either the reforms are being done very slowly, or they are not being implemented properly or they are not being done at all. As a result of that there are still thousands of workers who are not being paid properly, they are not getting justice, or are living in poor conditions.
We all know that as big tournaments come and go the window of change closes a little bit. What is being done for workers is not what is being promised. Promising reform is not actually the same as delivering it.
Meanwhile, a spokesman at the Government Communications Office of the State of Qatar insisted the country would deal with any problems raised in the report. We are aware of a recent report published by Amnesty International concerning the status of workers in Qatar, he said. Qatar has made substantial progress on labour reforms. We continue to work with NGOs, including the International Labour Organisation, to ensure that these reforms are far-reaching and effective. Any issues or delays with our systems will be addressed comprehensively. We have said, from the outset, that this would take time, resources and commitment."

The decision, two-and-a-half years after the death of Zac Cox in January 2017, is seen as a breakthrough for campaigners disturbed by health and safety issues surrounding the building of the stadiums, even though it comes relatively close to the completion of the bulk of the construction work for the tournament.
Campaigners said it was the first known inquiry into a specific death during the construction of World Cup stadiums. The inquiry will be conducted by Sir Robert Akenhead, a former high court judge with expertise in construction law and site accidents.
In February 2018 a British coroner sharply criticised safety measures at the stadium site. She said equipment provided to Cox was not fit for purpose.
Coxs two sisters-in-law, Ella Joseph and Hazel Mayes, said in a statement that the period since his death had been extremely difficult for the family and they were pleased by the decision from the Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.
They said: We wanted to get to the truth about the decisions and circumstances that led to his death and to try to ensure that lessons are learned that could prevent other similar accidents occurring in the future.
According to the statement, Akenhead has been asked to examine the underlying causes of Zacs death, the decisions that led to the death, the process of investigation since the death and safety lessons that have been learned and enforced since the incident.
The family said they also welcomed a commitment from the Qatari committee to ensure that everyone concerned cooperates fully with this independent investigation. They said Akenhead should be allowed to carry out his work with complete autonomy.
The long gap between Coxs death and the establishment of the inquiry underlines the sensitivity of the issue in Qatar and the persistence of the family in seeking fuller answers as to how he died.
Cox was killed at the Khalifa International Stadium after falling 40 metres off a suspended platform. He was employed by a South African subcontractor working for a German firm.
The accident occurred after lever hoist equipment failed, causing part of the platform on which Cox and a colleague were working to fall.
The coroner in Coxs inquest, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, said: Many managers knew and should have known they were effectively requiring a group of their workers to rely on potentially lethal equipment.
She said changes introduced to speed up the installation of the catwalks were chaotic, unprofessional, unthinking and downright dangerous.
Hamilton-Deeley said a perfect storm of events led to Coxs death, including a decision by the contractors to speed up the building of the stadiums roof. That move required the use of additional lever hoists that a fellow construction worker told the inquest were worthy only of the rubbish bin.
One crucial piece of information eventually submitted to the inquest was an internal report prepared by the contractors but never formally given to the family. The family obtained the report through unofficial channels and it said lever hoists used by the contractors did not have up-to-date safety certificates and that the health and safety system had not been followed.
Pfeifer, the German contractors working on the site, claimed that the report was not official because it was internal and therefore not relevant.
Speaking at the time of the coroners inquest, Mayes said the internal report, which was completed within 11 days of the incident, gives the most factual account of the event.
In one of the many injustices in the case, one of Coxs colleagues, Graham Vance, a South African who had been working alongside Cox when he fell, was arrested on the same day and was unable to leave Qatar for 11 months until a police investigation had concluded and he was cleared of any involvement.
We were initially reluctant to come forward because we had absolutely no desire to create any further pressure on Graham, who we have always believed to have been an innocent victim of this process, Mayes previously told the Guardian.
She said: Knowing that he was wrongfully held out there in Qatar for us was deeply distressing. He had just witnessed the death of his colleague at close proximity and it must have been an absolutely awful 11 months for him.
The Qatari committee said in a statement after the coroners verdict last year: Several systemic failures and human errors contributed to this incident. It acknowledged its failure to engage with the family directly over the reasons for his death.
The committee added: We are wholly committed to ensuring Sir Robert Akenhead is able to conduct his activity unhindered and with absolute autonomy and full co-operation. Any lessons that can be learnt from this investigation and applied to our World Cup projects to ensure an incident like this does not occur again will be welcomed.
The health and safety of all of our workers remains as our utmost priority. We will be making no further statements until the investigation has concluded.
Qatars treatment of migrant workers mainly from south-east Asia has been a source of criticism ever since the small but hugely wealthy nation won the right to stage the World Cup in December 2010.
Probably the most critical account of the safety culture in the stadiums was written by Human Rights Watch in September 2017. It called for regular autopsies into all deaths, and death certificates explaining cause of death. Its author claimed deaths continued at a high rate, although the International Labour Organisation has welcomed changes to mid-day working and exit visas for guest workers."

The supreme committee organising the World Cup makes the most of celebrating Qatars football history, which is a fascinating example of sports having been taken all around the world by British and European workers  here, in the oil and gas industries. Replicating a worldwide phenomenon, local people in the colonies or trading countries were introduced to sports, and clubs were formed on the European model.
It was only in 1970, the year of Brazils third World Cup triumph in the celebrated Mexico tournament lit up by Pelé, that Qatar even established a national team at all. That was a year before the country gained independence, under the rule of the al-Thani dynasty, from its status as a British protectorate. When its World Cup bid team, chaired by Sheikh Mohammed, the son of the then emir (ruler) Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, claimed the famous Fifa vote in December 2010, Qatar became the first country since 1934 to host a World Cup without ever having qualified for one.
Now, along with the $8bn to $10bn being spent on building seven new stadiums and on reconfiguring the Khalifa International stadium, and the $200bn on transport and general infrastructure, the Qataris are dedicating resources to ensure their national team  ranked 96th in the world  will not be embarrassed in 2022. The former Barcelona and Spain midfield legend Xavi has been in Doha since his retirement from elite competition in 2015, playing for the Al Sadd club and helping to develop young players, roles for which he is paid a reported £7m annual salary.
Talking at the Al Sadd Stadium after his teams 7-1 destruction of strugglers Al Kharaitiyat in the Qatar Stars League on 8 November, Xavi said it was fantastic to be an ambassador for Qatar. My family and I are very happy here and I am very grateful for the country, he said. My daughter was born here and my wife is due to have another baby here. It is an honour to be here.
Of the league and its playing standards, Xavi said: Now it is improving a lot. When I came here three years ago, the league was different, the level was I think less, now it has improved a lot because the foreign players are better than before, the coaches are better, I think they are doing well. And its good for the Qatari players; they can learn many things from the foreign players.
The partnerships with Barcelona have been deep and expensive; Qatar Foundation was the Catalan clubs first shirt sponsor, followed by a 171m deal with Qatar Airways from 2010 until last year. Pep Guardiola, like Xavi, finished his playing career in Qatar, and was recruited to be one of the World Cups bid ambassadors after the country launched it in March 2009.
Félix Sánchez Bas, the national team manager, is a former Barcelona youth coach who first moved to work in the Aspire academy system in Doha 12 years ago. Under his tutelage, the team are making significant strides: they beat Switzerland 1-0 in a friendly last week and drew 2-2 with Iceland on Monday. The latter match was played at the Kehrwegstadion of the Belgian club Eupen, one of three European clubs bought by the Aspire system as development grounds for young players.
The tiny Gulf emirate of only 300,000 citizens  and 1.7m migrant workers mostly from India, Nepal and Bangladesh  has inevitably struggled to field a competitive team from so small a youth population. Since embarking on its strategy of national projection after Sheikh Hamad usurped his father, Sheikh Khalifa, in 1995, the national football team have made fulsome use of Fifas qualification criteria, which makes players eligible if they have lived in a country for five years from the age of 18.
Of the starting XI who played Iceland on Monday, four players were born outside Qatar: the defenders Bonalem Rhoukhi (Algeria), and Ró-Ró (Portugal); the midfielder Karim Boudiaf (France), and the forward Almoez Ali (Sudan). The money, resources and determined strategy being channelled into development have greatly improved standards among the Qatar-born players too. The striker Akram Afif, 22, is considered the star and is back on loan at Al Sadd after graduating through the Aspire academy, playing for Eupen and then signing for Villareal in 2016.
Optimism on the teams prospects for holding its own when they play the first World Cup match at the 80,000 capacity Lusail Iconic Stadium on 21 November, 2022, has been boosted by Qatar qualifying for next years Under-20 World Cup in Poland.
The new generations are different from the old one, Xavi told us. Because I think the most important thing is Aspire. It started in 2006 and [so] the new generation are more professional. I think they are preparing well. They have a very good coach now in the national team, Félix Sánchez, I know him very well. Of course it is not easy to play against the big teams  Brazil, Spain  but at least I think they will compete well in 2022. Also they have time, they have four years to prepare well, but lets see.
Given the supreme committees pitch about Qatars passion for football and the presence of Xavi, still a supreme short- and long-passing master, in wonderful dotage at this local club, it was sobering to see a crowd of only 400 at the Al Sadd match. Notices at the stadium prescribed modest dress, the fans were all men, and the atmosphere was a lame affair of half-hearted songs orchestrated by organised drumming and cheerleaders.
Xavi said he does not mind playing in an empty ground because he still loves football but acknowledged the lack of spectators is a problem. Some Qataris, we were told, are more inclined to take a flight to watch Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain or a Premier League match than support the average QSL match.
Its a pity, Xavi said. In the Emir cup, in the [Asian] Champions League, the stadium was full. It depends on the game. Today, OK, it is an easy game for us and people stay at home to watch the game [on TV]. Generally the crowds are not so big. We have to find some solution to excite the people to come for this kind of game. I dont know how.
He was clear he believes the World Cup, in the agreeable temperature of the desert winter, will be a success; the stadiums brilliantly designed, the organisation planned in fine detail and infinitely well-resourced.
They are preparing well, they had many years to prepare, all the construction, the stadiums; people here are excited. Because it is in December, the players will be in better fitness, the [move to winter] I think is a very good solution, this weather is fantastic, 25, 30 degrees. I think it will be one of the best World Cups in history."

accommodation camp of the supreme committee organising the 2022 World Cup, when I talked with them about their lives as migrant workers in the wealthiest country on earth. They had come from Ghana, where they said adverts about construction jobs in Qatar were broadcast on the radio, and about 300 of them had taken the opportunity. All four had paid agents, an exploitation that is officially outlawed but is endemic in the recruitment of millions of people from poorer countries to work all over the oil and gas-rich Gulf.
The agent said to me: Qatar is the richest country in the world; you can Google it, one man told me. He said we would earn a huge salary. But when we came here, we found it was the opposite.
Al-Rayyan is one of seven dazzling stadiums being built around the Qatari capital, Doha, in addition to the reconfiguring of the sole pre-existing World Cup venue, Khalifa International, which was completed last year. The total cost is between $8bn and $10bn, according to the supreme committees general secretary, Hassan al-Thawadi. Representatives of the supreme committee and their contractors walked us on a tour of al-Rayyan, being built to Fifas highest specifications. In heat and glare, 10 men from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, the most common countries of origin for Qatars migrant workers, were neatly cementing square vents beneath every seat, in time for a tournament due to begin in exactly four years time  on 21 November 2022.
The supreme committee has pledged high standards for workers rights and welfare after torrential criticism of conditions by human rights organisations and the media, and they showed us some of their workings. The health and safety manager, Abdulla Ahmad al-Bishri  who studied engineering at South Tyneside college in north?east England  showed us records of exemplary safety standards. Bishri and representatives of AECOM, the American project manager, showed us an accident frequency rate of 0.005% and told us 7,000 people had been trained for working at height and about the measures they use for mandatory breaks when the heat becomes impossible; the canteens of water containing electrolytes carried by all the workers; the safety signs in English, Hindi and Tamil; the confidential grievance hotline.

At the camp, accommodating 4,500 men, they guided us around the improved facilities adopted widely to replace dire, overcrowded, unsanitary dumps that still plague the country. Official government standards still allow four workers to be accommodated in one room but bunk beds are outlawed. Food is cooked and supplied to good nutritional standards; there is a medical centre on site, plus a gym, a football pitch and a computer room with free internet to help the men, all away from their families, communicate with home. There is also a free laundry service  Just like a hotel, one of our guides said.
So when I finally sat down to talk to the workers, I was almost ready for them to say they could hardly be happier. Aged between 28 and 38, all married with at least one child, they acknowledged that the camp was decent; they had Ghanaian friends in other camps which were dirty, and had no food or amenities. Then they started to talk about the pay.
It is hard to be away for so long, one said. Sometimes the family want to have you in their midst  and you may not have money to send them. We were supposed to earn something big  but we earn small.
Asked how much, one of them opened his eyes wide in exasperation, and said: 650 a month basic salary.
For building one of the prestige stadiums designed so Qatar can dazzle the world in 2022, eight hours a day, six days a week, this is £140: a little under £35 per week; £5 per day.
Like all the migrants working in Qatar, the money they send home is not extra; it is primary income to support their families. The Ghanaians said they still have expenses in Qatar, although food and accommodation is taken care of, and the money is not enough.
Top: Accommodation blocks at the QDVC migrant workers labour camp near al-Khor. Below left: A bedroom shared by four men and, right, signs in the main office at the camp.
One man, 38, who said he had two sons, aged 10 and two, explained: Our system in Ghana is the extended family. When anybody needs help, they come to you. They know we have travelled to Qatar and ask us for money, but we dont have it. I do not have enough to feed my family. The money is not what we expected to get. We think about this all the time.
They said they did not believe that raising a grievance would change anything. A 29-year-old man said: We dont have help from anywhere, we have to support and encourage ourselves every day. Otherwise what will you do: kill yourself?
The supreme committee always argued that the scrutiny arising from the success, in 2010, of the bid for 2022 could be a catalyst for reform. This tournament is, inescapably, a World Cup of inequality, hosted by the per capita wealthiest country, built by men from the poorest.
In October 2017, the government headed off an impending formal commission of inquiry into the conditions of its migrant workers by the UN agency the International Labour Organisation, by agreeing to work with the ILO on a programme of reforms. In a statement from Thamer al-Thani, Qatars media attache in the UK, the government said it was committed to working with our international partners, including the ILO, to improve the rights and living conditions of our guest workers. Qatar welcomes all constructive feedback of our labour system and we have never shied away from the idea that further reform is required.
A major breakthrough was hailed in September with the abolition for most workers  although not domestic staff  of the loathed exit permit, which prevented people at the end of contracts returning home without their employers permission.
Houtan Homayounpour, head of the ILOs Qatar project office, describes that as a beneficial change, and he lists other results: settlement committees for workers disputes, legal protections for domestic workers, and a commitment to ending the notorious kafala system, which ties workers to a single, sponsoring employer.
The supreme committee has itself implemented a system for reimbursing workers some of the recruitment fees they paid to agents. Mahmoud Qutub, executive director of workers welfare, told us they expect to pay 89m rials, £19m, to 39,000 workers over the next three years, an average of £487 each.
Clockwise from top left: The gym at the Challenger trading and contracting labour camp near the al-Rayyan stadium; migrant workers have a game of football at the camp; labourers play table football and returning to the camp from a shift.
Actions speak louder than words; real changes have been made, Homayounpour said. Is it perfect? No. The government admits that and there is much more to do. There is genuine progress but challenges remain, which we are working on.
The government has committed itself to introducing a minimum wage, and while research continues into a recommended level, a temporary figure has been agreed. But it is only 750 rials a month  £160, a little under £40 a week.
The supreme committee said its contractors at al-Rayyan were instructed in September to pay the advisory minimum wage of 750 per month to all employees. They said they investigated the pay of the Ghanaian men and did find one of them being paid 650. This has now been rectified, a spokesman said.
The senior figures we talked to seemed to struggle to see injustice in the painfully low pay, saying it was much more than people would earn in their home countries. The remittance of money by people working in wealthier countries to low- and middle-income countries is indeed a global phenomenon; in 2017, the World Bank has reported, $466bn was remitted, with India the biggest recipient, of $69bn.
One expert in Doha said that when trying to understand the resilience of so many migrant workers in tough conditions, it is important to remember the hardships from which they have escaped. In their home countries, many of these people live in incredibly poor, subsistence conditions, he said. There are no jobs, no infrastructure, no roads or drinkable water in some areas, and labour exploitation. We are seeking to address important issues, but they see their ability to work in Qatar and send money home as a huge advance.
A warning sign at the al-Rayyan stadium site.
The government is keen to showcase the strides it has made to improve welfare, and it organised access to two camps that meet its standards. The first, up a desolate road at al-Khor to the north of Doha, past a sandy stretch pockmarked with twisted remains of metal sheds, accommodates 3,000 men working for the French-Qatari construction joint venture, QDVC. The companys staff and government inspectors proudly showed us the bare rooms shared by four men, separate clean toilets and showers, large gym and internet room  and while we could appreciate the physical basics being provided, we found the place painfully bleak.
The governments policy to address the large problems with inadequate accommodation, often run by smaller companies, they said, has been to commission Labour City, a vast, purpose-built complex behind high walls and railings, opened in 2015 to accommodate 100,000. In total five camps are planned, to move up to 600,000 to the solid buildings and better facilities, which incorporate clean toilets and showers, catered food, communal green spaces, a large mosque and places of worship for other religions, medical and recreational facilities. Famously next door is Asian Town with its mall and restaurants for workers, and a 15,000-seat cricket stadium and an amphitheatre for outdoor events.
In a corporate presentation my guides put on before the tour, Labour City was said to be born of the wise vision of the state of Qatar. The language was telling, though: the presentation said the camp was built to provide a proper environment for this category of society.
In the internet room upstairs in one of the blocks, a lone man was watching YouTube clips from home, earphones on. He was 38, he said, from a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. He had been in Qatar for seven years. He was married with three children, aged 12, eight and five. Before, I stayed in different camps, in wooden cabins. Now it is better, safer, to be in a concrete building. And it is good to be near the shops and supermarket, because some camps were far from town.
Asked how it felt to be so far from his family, he said: I miss them. When I feel too much pain, I call them. But I am earning enough money to support my family and relatives. So I am feeling relaxed.
To meet workers outside the designated camps, a man with local knowledge took me to a street corner in the Msheireb area of downtown Doha. Round the corner from the Corniche strip of beach, and the Souq Waqif complex of shops and restaurants, the area turns suddenly into a rundown street transplanted from Bangladesh. My interpreter walked into the crowd and asked two young men how life was for them. He explained loudly that I was from a newspaper, that newspapers had reported the oppression of the exit permit, the government had read the coverage, and the exit permit had been abolished, so they should talk to me in the hope their lives might change.
Within minutes, a huge crowd of men had gathered, all telling stories of despair. Their experiences made life in the camps seem secure, enviable by comparison.
People here are not working, one man said. Or they are working but not being paid. There is no work, or very low pay.
Migrant workers look across the water to the skyscrapers of West Bay in Doha on their day off.
They had all paid agents for visas, one or two had purported sponsors that proved to be a mirage; one man unfolded a scrap of paper with his sponsors name on it, a company he had never been able to find.
The agents said Qatar is a very rich country, with the 2022 World Cup; there you can earn good money, one Bangladeshi man, 28, told me. But here when you work, the company does not pay you.
They had found bits of work on construction projects, they said, as electricians, plumbers, firefighters, from subcontractors, supply companies, who did not pay them or folded. One man just stood and shook his head, repeating supply companies over and over again. He was 38, he said, with a wife and 10-year-old daughter in Bangladesh, and was in agony because he could not send money home and did not have the fees to keep his daughter in school. His wife criticised him for going to Qatar, because rickshaw drivers in his village were making money to support their families.
Another young man, 26, shouted that he did not have money even to eat: No rice, no vegetables, no chicken, he said. Only chapati.
His eyes had a look of pleading. I asked how long he had gone without proper food.
Eight months, he replied.
We promised I would report these stories, and that the government and the supreme committee organising the 2022 World Cup would read the coverage. Within five minutes my interpreter and I were driving along the Corniche, past the formidable, floodlit Emiri Diwan, Qatars parliament building. Soon we were up in the West Bay, among the towers, hotels and restaurants where fans will enjoy exquisite service in 2022, amid the signs of the supreme committee, with their promise for the World Cup to Deliver Amazing."

Narayan Tharus family cremated him by the banks of the Budhi river in southeast Nepal. His wife, Renuka Chaudhary, wailed in despair. She circled the red coffin before tossing sugar, mustard seeds and barley on to the pyre to purify it. As the flames engulfed her husbands body, she collapsed and was carried away.
Chaudhary and the couples four-year-old daughter, Sadikshya, spoke to her husband by phone every two or three days, until the day they received a call from Qatar from a number she did not recognise. Tharu, 23, died in August when he fell from a high walkway at the £512m al-Wakrah stadium, being built for the 2022 World Cup.
A friend of his called and told us he had fallen down. We only found that he had actually died after lots of calls and digging, Chaudhary told the Guardian.
In a blur of grief, Chaudhary took two more calls from Qatar, one from Manar General Contracting, the company that employed her husband, and one from the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, the body organising the World Cup. The man from the supreme committee said sorry. I asked him how my husband died. He said they were investigating the death, she said. Three months later, Chaudhary is still waiting for an answer.
The Guardian has spoken to four people with direct knowledge of the incident. The sources say Tharu was carrying a large board along a 35 metre-high walkway at night, when the accident occurred.
He fell off from the walkway  Its usually considered safe. But people from another company had removed a [floor] plate, creating a gap. He failed to see it and fell through it, said one source.
Another said: One of the blocks joining the passage was taken without informing workers  creating a gap  Since Tharu was carrying a [board], he couldnt see it and fell from there.
A spokesperson for the supreme committee said lessons have been learned from the death and corrective measures were implemented across the al-Wakrah site and other supreme committee sites to avoid a repeat.
A source with knowledge of the stadium said new workers are given training and time to acclimatise before starting work, but he also described an environment where conflict and miscommunication can exist between different groups of subcontractors.
Its a basic conversation. Sometimes when its hard to understand each other, we use sign language, he said.
Manar General Contracting has told Chaudhary she can expect compensation by December. Nepals ministry of foreign affairs said that it might take a year. Im so worried. I have no one to earn money for the family now. How can I pay for our daughters education and raise her?
The family has received compensation from two Nepali insurance schemes but it is not enough to secure their future.
A spokesperson for the supreme committee said: The supreme committee conducted an independent investigation into the circumstances leading to the tragic death of Mr Tharu  however, the case is currently open with Qatars public prosecution service. Once a final verdict has been reached we will be in a position to release more details  and will work with the relevant authorities to ensure that the appropriate funds are released.
A human resources manager from Manar General Contracting said compensation has not been released because, the case is still ongoing.
Tharus death and the authorities response have similarities to that of Zac Cox, a British construction worker who fell to his death at the Khalifa World Cup stadium in January 2017. Coxs family struggled to obtain information about his death. A British coroner investigating it concluded he died because of substandard equipment, describing his working environment as downright dangerous.
Three other al-Wakrah stadium workers have died this year, all off site. Bhupendra Magar, 35, and Ramsis Mukhiya, 52, both Nepalis who had been working on the al-Wakrah stadium, died in their labour camp between shifts in May and June, respectively. Their families are also still waiting for compensation from their employers in Qatar.
Mohan Magar said his brothers wife and two children are struggling to get by. The children are still small. He has a wife who doesnt have an income. Its hard, he said.
Magar had only gone to Qatar in a bid to pay off a huge debt he had incurred when he borrowed almost £4,000 to get a job in Afghanistan. The job fell through and Magar was left destitute. But Mohan said his brothers health had been good. He was strong and had undergone a medical examination before leaving for Qatar. He was just fine.According to their death certificates, Magar died of acute respiratory failure and Mukhiya of acute heart failure, but experts say the findings do not explain the underlying cause of the deaths.
In its 2017 workers welfare report, the supreme committee categorised five similar deaths of stadium workers as non-work related.
If we do not know how workers are dying, it is impossible to say if they are work-related deaths or not. We know the risk of heat stress exposure is extreme in the summer months and the protection is demonstrably inadequate, so these deaths raise real concerns, says Nick McGeehan, an expert on migrant worker rights in the Gulf.
Peak day-time temperatures in Qatar reached 47C in June this year and only once fell below 40C in the month.
The Supreme Committee said it investigates all deaths on its sites. In the case of Mr Magar and Mr Mukhiya  there were no obvious contributing factors to either death  heat stress was not a contributing factor as per experts report and the result of the medical investigation, a spokesperson said. The responsibility to investigate underlying causes of death lies with the relevant local authorities.
A 2014 report by DLA Piper, an international law firm commissioned by Qatari authorities to investigate the treatment of migrant workers, recommended that the government order an independent study into the deaths of migrant workers from cardiac arrest. The Qatar government did not respond to enquiries about whether the study has been commissioned.
The al-Wakrah stadium, designed by the late British architect Zaha Hadid, is set to host group games and a quarter-final. Gianni Infantino, Fifas president, visited the stadium last month and said it was absolutely impressive.
Itahari, the corner of Nepal where Tharu came from, is surrounded by lush green rice paddies and could not be more different from Qatar. But migrating overseas for work is a way of life. More than 30% of Nepali migrant workers come from just eight small districts in the south-east.
PK Mandal, a relative, said there are around 200 houses in the community and 30 to 40 men have gone to work abroad in the past four or five years. Foreign employment has brought a lot of success, but this is the third death in that time, he said.
Sita, Tharus mother, said: Im heartbroken. My son has gone for ever. Hes never coming back. He has a small daughter. Life is long and hard. How will she survive?"

The report names an engineering company, Mercury MENA, which it says left almost 80 workers from Nepal, India and the Philippines stranded and unpaid for months in Qatar. Amnesty accuses the company of using the kafala structure  which it describes as Qatars notorious sponsorship system that ties employees to a single employer  to exploit scores of migrant workers.
In Nepal, 34 people told Amnesty they were owed on average £1,500 by Mercury MENA, and that the kafala system was used to exploit them. One worker said the company had finally agreed in October 2017 that he could leave to work for another company in Qatar, but that in return for that permission, required under kafala, he had to renounce his claim for unpaid wages.
Last October, Qatars government committed to work with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on wholesale reform of kafala and substantial elements of its labour laws after years of sustained criticism highlighting human rights abuses relating to migrant workers. This month the emir of Qatar issued a law abolishing, for most workers, the power of employers to grant or withhold exit permits, which were used to prevent people from leaving the country.
However, Amnesty argues that the central exploitative problem with kafala remains, which is that workers are tied to a single employer, and that reform through the ILO process is happening too slowly.
The exit permit is just one key of Qatars notorious kafala sponsorship system. This system has fuelled widespread abuse and exploitation of migrant workers, including forced labour, Amnesty said.
Although today most workers no longer need their employers permission to leave the country, they still need a non-objection certificate from their employer to change jobs in Qatar. Many employers refuse to provide such certificates, and workers are forced to stay until their contracts finish, which can be up to five years.
Workers who leave their jobs without employer permission can be reported for absconding, attracting a criminal charge that could lead to arrest and deportation. This is in contravention of international labour laws and standards.
According to Amnesty, Mercury MENA worked on an infrastructure project  although not directly on a World Cup project  in the new city of Lusail in Qatars capital, Doha, which will host a showpiece stadium where the 2022 World Cup opening match and final will be held. Workers said they began to have problems being paid by the company after a corporate reorganisation in 2015. Amnesty said it was calling for the Qatari government to ensure the employees receive the money they are owed, while ensuring there are fundamental reforms to the kafala sponsorship system.
The ILO said the Qatar government had made substantial progress on its three-year technical cooperation programme to ensure compliance with ratified international labour conventions as well as achieving basic principles and rights related to work in Qatar.
The abolition of the need for exit visas for the majority of workers marks the removal of a major element of kafala, the ILO said, and the government recently committed to further dismantling the system next year, allowing people to move jobs freely. A number of significant structural changes introduced by Qatar, the ILO said, include the adoption of a temporary minimum wage in October 2017, improvements to the health and safety regime, an inspectorate system, and establishing dispute resolution committees to deal with workers complaints. Qatar also said a fund would be set up to pay staff wages where employers have not done so, although it is expected to apply retrospectively to only one years pay and so is unlikely to compensate the Mercury MENA workers.
The ILO said it would continue to work with the government of Qatar as well as representatives of employers, global unions and other partners to ensure that the goals of the cooperation programme are met.
Amnesty said in its report that Mercury MENA, which it described as ailing, had not responded to its concerns since November, nor to a summary of its findings sent to the company in July. At the time of writing, the Guardian had not received a reply to emails sent to the company.
This article was amended on Wednesday 26 September at 08:22 to make clear that the affected workers were not employed directly on World Cup projects."

But Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said the changes would take the heart out of the kafala system, a notorious form of sponsorship that binds workers to their employer.
Under the new law, employers will no longer have the power to deny exit permits to most of their workers, though they will retain this right for 5% of their workforce.
The changes will not affect the rights of workers who are not covered by Qatars labour law, such as the countrys 174,000 domestic workers. Research by Amnesty International has found domestic workers are especially vulnerable, face long working hours, severe restrictions on freedom of movement and physical and sexual abuse.
Houtan Homayounpour, head of the International Labour Organization project office in Qatar, said the law was a first step towards full suppression of exit permits.
There are more than 1.9 million migrant workers in Qatar  about 90% of the countrys total population, according to the ministry of development planning and statistics. Most are from south and south-east Asian countries including India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Bangladesh.
Reports of appalling working conditions have placed Qatar under intense pressure to improve migrant worker rights. In 2013, a Guardian investigation found evidence of forced labour for migrants working on Qatars World Cup infrastructure projects.
Workers alleged that they had not been paid for months, that they had been denied access to free drinking water in the desert heat, and that passports were routinely confiscated. During the summer of 2013, Nepalese workers died at a rate of almost one a day in Qatar, many of them young men who had sudden heart attacks.
James Lynch, an independent researcher specialising in Qatar and migrant rights, said the changes to residency law marked an important milestone, but called for wider reforms that include all workers.
At present, the law essentially says that you are bound to your employer for the rest of your contract, which can run for up to five years, said Lynch.
Workers who leave their jobs without employers permission can be reported for absconding, and could face arrest and deportation.
[The new law] certainly removes a tool for employers, but what you see in other Gulf states is that employers will confiscate passports, so the next step has to be reforming laws on passport confiscation, Lynch added.
Qatari law allows companies to hold an employees passport, provided they have written consent.
Burrow said the 5% allowance for employers was an interim measure, and that further regulations would be announced regarding workers who fall outside the labour code.
The reforms are a step towards fundamental rights for migrant workers, she added. The kafala system was built around the fact that workers had to be sponsored, but they were effectively owned by another human being: their employer. Their visa was dependent on it, their identity card, their right to be in the country. It was modern-day slavery by any name.
Qatars World Cup legacy can be the transformation of its labour system from one that drives exploitation to one that provides an example for the region, said Stephen Cockburn, deputy director of the global issues programme at Amnesty International. There remains a huge amount to do, and fully abolishing the exit permit should be one step among many in achieving that."

Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatars closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf states role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.
Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were diverted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatars sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics  12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.
The stated aim for the blockade  which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands  was a protest against what was seen as Qatars singular role in funding terrorism (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.
Far from destabilising Qatars ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an us against the world authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capitals six-lane corniche.
Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatars long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis stated goal has been to create a diverse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money  and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup  solves only some of those skills shortages.
It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work, she said. But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.
Qatars modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hinds parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of Education City and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.
From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen partner universities that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A&M for engineering, and so on.
The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaass idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the childrens library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.
Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.
There is a blatant look at us attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard  and splashing out ostentatiously on the worlds most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezannes The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.
That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.
The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeeras reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Dohas ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas; hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood; offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.
For Qatars detractors, al-Jazeera has become the symbol of the hypocrisies of that self-styled radicalism. In Doha it is rather an emblem of independence and sovereignty. As Sheikha Hind suggests: Imagine [another nation] telling Britain to close the BBC  you would be shocked. She makes a strong case for the liberalising effect the broadcaster has had. I think when we are talking about where we want our region to be, al-Jazeera is an important part of that   she says. Maybe a lot of people are not happy with things that have come out from the darkness, but if you want to build a civil society and allow people to think for themselves and be critical, every story has to come out. The apparent effort to embed that muck-raking spirit more deeply in Qatari society is rooted in the Education City campus of Northwestern University  an outpost of its Medill School of Journalism.
The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estates role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it  the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here.
Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).
There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.
In the deans view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.
In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural divide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?
I wont lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade, Sheikha Hind says, absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it  whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in. She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now. The goal has not changed, she suggests, but now we are running rather than walking.

worker died was 'downright dangerous',"The only western construction worker killed in the building of World Cup stadiums in Qatar was provided with substandard equipment by managers who should have known the risks of a downright dangerous environment, a British coroner has said.
Zac Cox, 40, died in January 2017 after he fell 40 metres (131ft) from rigging when a catwalk he was helping to install at the Khalifa stadium in Doha collapsed. The accident occurred after lever hoist equipment failed, causing part of the platform on which Cox and a colleague were working to fall.
The coroner, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, told Coxs inquest in Brighton on Tuesday: Many managers knew and should have known they were effectively requiring a group of their workers to rely on potentially lethal equipment.
She said the changes introduced to speed up the installation of the catwalks were chaotic, unprofessional, unthinking and downright dangerous.
Hamilton-Deeley added that a perfect storm of events led to Coxs death, including a decision by the contractors to speed up the building of the stadiums roof. That move required the use of additional lever hoists that a fellow construction worker told the inquest were only worthy of the rubbish bin.
The coroner said: If you cut to the quick, the root cause of the accident was that the workers were being asked to use equipment that was not fit for purpose. Horribly simple, really.
Documents submitted to the inquest included an incident investigation report prepared by the contractors, which acknowledged that the lever hoists did not have up-to-date safety certificates and that the health and safety system was not followed.
Jon Johnson, a fellow construction worker who witnessed the incident, told the inquest that he did not like the look of the rusty lever hoists, saying: Bolts were missing, some of the mechanisms hardly functioned, and there were parts missing from them. They were rubbish. They should have been thrown in the rubbish bin.
The report, completed within 11 days of Coxs death, was never given to his British relatives by the stadium construction contractors. One of the contractors, the German firm Pfeifer, told the Guardian the document was never given to the family because it was an internal report.
After Coxs death, the Qatari authorities arrested his friend and work colleague Graham Vance, accusing him of negligence and seeking his imprisonment for a maximum of three years. Detained in Qatar pending his trial and an appeal by the prosecutors, Vance was allowed to return home to South Africa only after 10 months. He was eventually acquitted of responsibility for Coxs death, and has described the months awaiting trial as a year of hell.
Vance was detained by the Qatari authorities even though the internal company report pinned much of the blame for the accident on the provision of uncertified equipment. The report was obtained by lawyers acting for Vance.
Contracts for different aspects of the Khalifa stadium construction work are held by a joint venture between Midmac Six-Construct, Pfeifer, and Eversendai. There is a dispute as to who was responsible for ensuring that the safety certificates were available.
The internal report said the third-party certificate for the hoist had expired months earlier. It also revealed that pressure to speed up the construction of the platforms led to the introduction of unchecked lever hoists.
It said there were serious errors of judgment in the events leading to Coxs death, and that the management system for the site was not followed and in some cases not understood by key persons in the Pfeifer organisation and that there was a lack of monitoring.
The report also blamed human error by the construction workers, including a failure by Cox to wear a second harness, but his colleagues say there was no requirement to wear a second harness for the specific work he was doing.
Vance was arrested within hours of the accident. I was devastated, he said. Imagine being arrested just after seeing a co-worker fall about 40 metres and die. I was talking to him minutes before he fell and even tried to grab the rope when it snapped. My hands were cut and bruised from trying to save him but the police did not care  they wanted to blame someone.
Stuart Laubscher, a family friend and lawyer, flew to Qatar to assist Vance. He said the internal report had not been circulated, even though it would have exonerated Vance. Pfeifer said the report was unofficial and therefore not relevant.
Laubscher said: In all my experience of the law I have never seen anything like this. The first thing I questioned was why the internal report had not been submitted to the court.
Coxs British sister-in-law has written to the British Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, asking him to investigate. Ella Joseph said: The decision to sit on this report rather than publish it and act on it is deeply distressing to us, and we will no longer remain silent.
Saying that the family had seen no evidence that Vance was responsible for Coxs death, Joseph added: We are therefore greatly relieved that he has now been completely exonerated. We are, however, gravely concerned that his lawyer has alleged that key evidence that would have made plain his innocence from the start was withheld from the Qatari court.
The family called for an independent inquiry to ensure that those responsible for the decisions that led to Coxs death were held accountable.
Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, the body in Qatar overseeing the 2022 World Cup, wrote to the family on 21 February saying it had continuously encouraged the contractor to share information about the accident, and the various investigations into its cause.
It added that it had not been appropriate for the delivery authority to contact the family until the court proceedings in Qatar had ended.
Pfeifer said in a statement: All official information in the possession of Pfeifer GmbH has been immediately forwarded to the family. The internal investigation report does not constitute an official report conducted by the Qatari authorities and therefore is not relevant. All information has been communicated to the Qatari authorities.
Pfeifer added that it understood the tragedy and strain of the case for the family and was in regular contact with them. It said that as well as providing support and accommodation for Vance in Qatar, it had covered his legal fees as an act of individual and personal support. It also noted that no employee had been questioned by the Qatari prosecution authorities during the case.
In a statement, the delivery committee said several systemic failures and human errors contributed to this incident. It added that after an investigation, it had ordered a comprehensive mandatory review of working at height practices, among other measures.
It said it deeply regrets not establishing a direct communication with the family of Cox during this time, and added that it had since contacted them and offered its full support."

Yet it appears the wellbeing of the workers building these facilities has too often been held cheap. In October, responding to criticism, Doha promised major labour reforms including axing a system described as modern day slavery. But safety remains a pressing issue.
The supreme committee organising the event has long said it is striving to enact higher than usual welfare standards for World Cup projects. It has recorded 10 deaths since October 2015, but has classified eight of these (including three of men in their 20s) as non-work-related, despite immense scepticism from campaigners. On Tuesday, an inquest in Brighton examined one of the remaining deaths, of the British worker Zac Cox, who died last January after falling 40m as he installed a walkway in the roof of the Khalifa stadium in Doha. His relatives distress was compounded by the response when they tried to find out what had happened and why: months of silence from the Qatari authorities (broken only a week ago). Building contractors were seen to be less than helpful. Mr Coxs relatives belatedly discovered that an investigation was carried out weeks after his death, which concluded that it was caused by the failure of the lifting equipment provided to him on site and that this equipment was known to be in poor condition. This was the conclusion of the coroner.
Yet the report  now submitted to the inquest  was never published, nor given to relatives by his employers or Qatari authorities. The family wants an independent inquiry and is urging the Foreign Office to pursue the case urgently with the Gulf state. Fifa too, which profits so handsomely from the World Cup, has a responsibility to press authorities to ensure that workers deaths are quickly, thoroughly and transparently investigated. Mr Coxs relatives deserve justice and accountability. The number of workers at World Cup stadiums is expected to rise from 12,000 to 36,000 this year.

Zac Cox died in January after he fell 40 metres when his safety equipment failed. His family have been told that a report containing vital information about the circumstances of his death exists, but it has not been passed on to them or the British coroner investigating his death.
This week, the coroner lambasted the familys treatment, which raises questions about how much the Foreign Office has done to force Qatari authorities to explain the reasons for Coxs death.
The body overseeing the World Cup, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, has never communicated with the family about the accident. The German construction multinational Pfeifer  which was contracted to build the stadium roof walkways on which Cox was working  has also failed to pass on information and respond to family emails setting out their concerns.
The British police have been unable to extract information from an opaque Qatari justice system, or the array of firms involved in the work.
Coxs wife died in 2015, and his two sisters-in-law, Ella Joseph and Hazel Mayes, have been trying to unearth the truth behind his death.
Joseph told the Guardian: Ten months on, we still dont have an official account of why our brother-in-law died and who was responsible. Weve had no assurance that a horrific incident like this wont happen again.
Speaking at the pre-inquest hearing in Brighton, the coroner, Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, said: It has proved almost impossible to get information. We find ourselves in a most unsatisfactory situation for everyone. If it had been in this country, state agencies would have been investigating his death.
I understand there are no such agencies in Qatar. Those investigations that have taken place are not available to me so far as Zacs death is concerned. The family have been told by a reliable source there is a 54-page report into Zacs death in Qatar which they are trying to gain access to.
It is almost impossible to get that information from Qatar.
The results of a postmortem examination in Qatar had not been supplied to the British inquest despite a request, Hamilton-Deeley said.
The coroner agreed on Thursday to the familys request to defer the closing of the inquest in the hope that more information might finally be released to the family, and levels of co-operation improve.
The family stressed the most important thing for them was to find out how their brother-in-law died and receive assurances that lessons had been learned by those building the football stadiums.
Reference to an inquiry into his death was made in the supreme committees second annual human rights report published in June, but it said full details could not be disclosed due to a continuing local authority inquiry.
Cox was working on a suspended catwalk platform on which cameras, sound and lighting could be installed when a lever hoist failed and one end of the catwalk dropped, leaving it hanging. Overloaded, Coxs lifeline snapped and he fell.
Lever hoists provided by Pfeifer were regarded as high quality. But some of Coxs colleagues have claimed that as pressure grew to speed up the work extra lever hoists of a lesser quality were provided at short notice by another firm.
Hamilton-Deeley stressed she did not have the remit to attribute any blame for his death. However, she added: Zacs death throws a spotlight on wider matters of the building works taking place for the World Cup. I cant see we will get further information in the forthcoming years or indeed ever.
There was pressure to speed up work  Insufficient lever hoists were available. So other lever hoists were brought in. It is suggested these other lever hoists were inferior quality and in a poor state of repair.
Joseph said: A loved one getting killed at work is always going to be devastating, but when its thousands of miles away you also feel utterly helpless. We are completely reliant on getting official information from the inquiries we have been told are under way in Qatar. But weve heard nothing  nothing at all from them.Efforts to secure an explanation from Pfeifer, including emails seen by the Guardian, have been met with no reply.
Mayes said: You would expect a major German-based company to be able to fulfil their commitment to update the family and give us basic information. They didnt do this. This week the ILO, the international labour standards authority, agreed to drop an inquiry into Qatars World Cup labour practices, declaring that employment standards had been reformed.
Human Rights Watch has claimed that more than 300 people have died, largely due to heat and exhaustion, on the project, although the numbers are disputed.
A Pfeifer source said he understood the pain of the family, adding that a Qatari court report on Coxs death was due to be published soon, probably this month. The case had taken time to complete partly because of the thoroughness of the inquiry, the interruption of Ramadan and the need to seek advice from international experts on the equipment, the source said.
The supreme council has been contacted for comment."

The number of workers in Qatar, brought in from poorer countries such as India, Nepal and Bangladesh and employed to build eight new stadiums for the tournament, is expected to rise from 12,000 to 36,000 over the next year.
The report calls on Fifa to press for improved inspection of conditions and a review of required standards. Regarding kafala, the intensely criticised system of employment that ties workers to one company, the recommendation is that Fifa actively explores ways to use its leverage to engage with the host government about the impact of the kafala system on migrant workers involved in World Cup construction.
The report is the first from the advisory board of eight international human rights experts, set up following a report last year by the professor John Ruggie into how Fifa could meet its responsibilities under the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights.
The report also calls on Fifa to support a thorough examination of all deaths and serious injuries sustained by workers on construction projects for next years World Cup in Russia, and for sanctions against companies responsible for failures. Several workers are reported to have died on World Cup construction sites in Russia and other human rights abuses have been discovered including appalling treatment of North Korean workers, whose employment Fifa has prohibited on its sites.
The vote to send the next World Cups to Russia and Qatar was made in December 2010 by the then 22 members of Fifas executive committee  12 of whom have since been banned by Fifa, accused of corruption by US authorities or investigated for alleged offences elsewhere  without workers human rights being a central consideration.
The Qatar government announced this week a three-year cooperation with the International Labour Organisation to reform and improve conditions for migrant workers, including kafala. Many campaigners believe the global focus on Qatar which followed the award of the 2022 World Cup has prompted the government to address the abuses.
However, the report of the Fifa human rights advisory board, which says Fifa has improved its commitment to decent human rights standards, was criticised as inadequate by the Gulf expert Nicholas McGeehan. As a researcher for Human Rights Watch, McGeehan sounded the alarm recently about the dangerous climatic conditions in Qatar through the summer months and the unexplained deaths of thousands of workers, including eight in the last two years on World Cup construction sites.
McGeehan sent his research to the advisory board last month, and asked it to recommend that Fifa insist Qatar put more protections for workers in place, investigate the deaths of workers rigorously and publish its findings. However, the report only says it has requested further information about inquiries made into workers deaths and recommends that Fifa support discussions about greater synergies between various parts of the inspection system in Qatar.
McGeehan said he found it shocking that the report did not make explicit and urgent recommendations to prevent people working in dangerous conditions, and investigate the deaths of workers from heart attacks and respiratory failure. Rachel Davis, a member of the advisory board, said its report was completed in early September before McGeehans research was published, but that the issues were discussed last month and the board will be taking forward our commitment to follow up on it."

Human rights abuses such as kafala, by which workers are tied to a single employer, low pay, poor accommodation, labouring in dangerous heat and hundreds of unexplained deaths, have been subjected to intense global scrutiny and criticism since 2010 when Fifa voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
The government concessions, reported by state media, were announced just before the International Labour Organisation was due to decide this week whether to hold a formal commission of inquiry into the conditions for migrant workers building Qatars massive infrastructure programme and 2022 stadiums. Sharan Burrow, the ITUC general secretary, said, following the agreements, she will recommend that formal complaints made against Qatar be withdrawn, meaning there will be no ILO commission of inquiry.
Nicholas McGeehan, an expert on migrant workers issues in the Gulf, sounded a note of caution, however. All we have today are promises, and promises have been broken before, he said. I feel we need to put expressions of optimism on hold until we see full details, changes in the law where necessary, and a time frame for promised reforms to be implemented.
The ITUC said the agreements represented a breakthrough to end kafala, principally because the government has said employers will no longer have the right to refuse visas for workers to leave the country. Burrow acknowledged that this does not address a central feature of kafala, which prevents workers moving jobs, but she said negotiations would start on that next.
Qatar state media reported that the cabinet, chaired by the prime minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, had approved changing the law on the regulation of the entry and departure of expats. Burrows said the change would mean that employers can no longer decide whether workers should be given exit visas; instead decisions will be made by a government committee.
The Qatar News Agency also reported that the labour minister, Issa Saad al-Jafali al-Nuaimi, had told foreign diplomats the country would introduce a minimum wage, although no details were given about its level, or when it will be introduced.
Other measures the ITUC said it had secured from the government included an end to the human rights abuse of workers having their promised contracts of employment replaced by worse terms when they arrive in the country. The ITUC said contracts would in future be lodged with a government authority. It said the government had also committed to having workers committees and a disputes resolution process for dealing with complaints and grievances. Burrow said the countrys ruler, the emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, supported these reforms.
This set of commitments explodes the model of modern slavery known as the kafala system in the Gulf States; Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates should now follow Qatars lead, Burrow said.
A spokesman for Amnesty International, which has persistently campaigned against human rights abuses of migrant workers in the Gulf, also greeted the news cautiously: We are not able to assess the significance of these developments until we have seen the full details of the governments commitments. However, todays announcements have clear potential to have a positive impact on migrant workers lives, depending on how theyre implemented.
We look forward to seeing the Qatari government committing to and delivering substantive reform of its sponsorship system, including ensuring that workers can leave the country and change jobs without their employers permission."

I know! Itll be hard to know whether to qualify for it or sign a triple entente in the hope itll see us through the group stage.
But first, a recap. Back in June, several countries in the region  including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt  instituted a blockade of Qatar, severing diplomatic relations and cutting off trade routes and so on. This, they said, was a response to the countrys support for terrorism and closeness to Iran. Among their various demands was that Qatar shut down the Doha?based al-Jazeera and align itself far more tightly with other Gulf countries. Eye?catchingly, Dubais high-profile security chief has now upped the stakes and claimed the blockade would end if Qatar gave up the World Cup. If the World Cup leaves Qatar, reasoned Lt Gen Dhahi Khalfan last Sunday, Qatars crisis will be over  because the crisis is created to get away from it.
Clarifying his comments the next day, he explained: I said Qatar is faking a crisis and claims its besieged so it could get away from the burdens of building expensive sports facilities for the World Cup. Thats why Qatar isnt ready and cant host the next World Cup. He went on to suggest that the cost is bigger than what the Hamadein [the ruling family] have planned.
On the one hand, lets not get carried away with this somewhat boggling analysis. It seems unlikely that Qatar is confecting a regional crisis solely to get out of honouring its commitment to host the World Cup  though the mere fact it could be suggested shows the Wag-the-Dog nature of the modern sporting mega-event. These things are not quite so expensive that its cheaper to have a war to get out of having to deliver them. But, you know  its close. Furthermore, I love how even the richest people on earth still apparently end up spending way more than theyre happy with on events of this type. Such is the demented mission creep of the mega-event that even Croesus would have ended up screaming: I AM NOT MADE OF MONEY, at the chairman of the Lydian organising committee trying to get him to sign off another bazillion of his newfangled coins for infrastructure security.
On the other hand  the Middle East is starting to look like the place where Fifa might finally find itself out of its depth. With past World Cup hosts, the process for our Zurich?based heroes has always been simple. Award World Cup to a country while denying inducements from immoral or innumerate local officials; get said country to spend insane amounts of money; get country to spend more money; get country to max out all lines of credit; insist country overrides its constitution and aspects of its rights legislation for your time in situ; leave with all the money and without paying any tax; respond with a hand wave or not at all when people talk about white elephant stadiums and infrastructure. Repeat.
Qatar, on the other hand, is proving slightly formula-resistant. Not only does it have the blockade hampering construction work, but last week also saw the leak to the BBC of a risk report on the tournament. Compiled by management consultants, it judged there is an increasing political risk that Qatar may not host the World Cup in 2022. As the report puts it: Western diplomats have privately stated they do not know whether or not the tournament will take place as planned. According to Qatar 2022s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the authors of this report have links to the countries blockading Qatar. For this reason, they say, it should be discounted. Alternatively, you may judge it should be paid particular attention to, as evidence that the blockade countries really mean to cause as much trouble as they can in relation to the World Cup.
Clearly some sort of PR pushback is necessary, and on Monday the New York Times ran an interview with the Qatar organising committee chief, Hassan al-Thawadai, conducted before the report came to light. Whether sight of it would have tempered some of his answers is unclear but without it there was much for students of sporting platitude and euphemism to enjoy. Did the blockade complicate the idea of making it a regional event, wondered the paper? No, came the amusing reply. Weve always taken the simple position that sports is elevated from conflict. Thats certainly a simple position  and time may show it to be a simplistic one. Still, you have to admire him for doubling down, declaring: Weve always focused on it being a regional World Cup. Just to clarify: is the region in question currently the one literally blockading you? This is a World Cup beyond Qatar, Thawadai insisted firmly. Its a cultural experience.
Well. It feels very regionist to describe the current diplomatic chicanery over a football tournament as cultural, but perhaps Thawadai meant something else. Indeed, despite the frequency with which the World Cup is used as a political tool  perhaps this time more than ever  he is falling back on the cliche that it will be a peacemaker and healer. It is, he insists, an opportunity to transform our region to a sustainable and stable future. That idea may well run up against the limits of its credibility in Qatar. The official slogan for Qatars 2022 World Cup bid was: Expect amazing. The unofficial slogan for its delivery period is: Hows that working out for ya?"

Often unhappy players pondering the futility of it all. High hopes dashed by the crushing disappointment of exiting a tournament on penalties. Many are the parallels that can be drawn between the team of amateurs featured in The Workers Cup and England football sides of yore, but for all the similarities between these enthusiastic players and their professional counterparts, the modern-day slaves featured in Adam Sobels documentary about an annual football championship organised for foreign workers in Qatari migrant labour camps could scarcely be further removed.
Housed in the spartan surrounds of the Umm Salal camp, home to more than 7,000 workers from India, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Nepal and Africa, they are among the poorest workers in the world, labouring in its richest country. The myriad hardships these workers are forced to endure on a daily basis have been well documented as they go about the back-breaking, and often deadly, business of building the infrastructure Qatar requires to stage the 2022 World Cup. They work long hours in dangerous, sweltering, dust?choked conditions for as little as $200 a month.
A recent report published by Human Rights Watch estimated that in the Arab states drive to prepare for the tournament it was controversially awarded by Fifa in 2010, Qatar has a migrant labour force of nearly two million workers who comprise almost 95% of the countrys labour force. Tasked with building the eight stadiums, numerous hotels, roads and everything else required for such a massive global jamboree, it is only through the systematic abuse and exploitation of these men  and they are almost all men  that staging the World Cup in Qatar will be possible.
While the country refuses to release information on worker deaths, Human Rights Watch estimates that there may have been 2,000 unexplained migrant worker fatalities since Sepp Blatter announced the destination of the World Cup after next. Fifa released a statement about the findings we put out, Nick McGeehan, author of the report, said in a recent interview. There was no expression of concern for the findings, there was no expression of concern for the deaths. The tone of it was sort of bristling with indignation that we would present information that was contrary to the narrative of events that they wanted to accept.
Sobels documentary helps put a human face on this misery, as the unprecedented behind-the-scenes access he is given enables him to introduce us to the players representing GCC (Global Construction Company) in the 2014 Workers Cup, organised by Qatars portentous sounding supreme committee for delivery & legacy.
It is a self-serving agenda, of course, which conveniently adheres to the narrative of events Fifa would rather accept. Participation increases the 24 construction companies chances of securing World Cup tenders, while overseas recruitment in the modern-day slave trade is that little bit easier when you can tempt desperate young men with photographic evidence of prospective colleagues playing football in front of enthusiastic crowds and having what looks like a pretty good time.
This tournament demonstrates how much we value corporate social responsibility, says one organiser, even though the players involved know only too well they are being used but play anyway because it helps alleviate the tedium of their lonely, desperate lives.
We meet Kenneth, Ghanaian and one of a few decent players on the GCC team, whose recruitment agent assured him he would be going to Qatar to join a professional football team. Betrayed and working in construction, the endearingly deluded 21-year-old hopes to catch the eye of a scout while playing in The Workers Cup.
The same age, Paul is Kenyan and desperately alone, confined as he is to barracks and building site seven days a week, obsessing over all the women he never gets to meet, let alone seduce, while sharing what is to all intents and purposes a prison with several thousand men.
Umesh, from India and a Manchester United fan, is working in Qatar to earn the price of his own house and will remain separated from his wife and two children, Rooney and Robin, for as long as that takes. A talented goalkeeper who played in the Ghanaian top flight but could not make a living, Samuel is too proud to tell his father he works in the building game and said he was off to Qatar to play professional football. Padam, from Nepal, spends what little spare time he has bickering with the wife he never sees over the phone.
These are desperate, largely likeable men but they do not ask for our pity. While the loneliness and hopelessness of their situation is one of the prevailing themes of The Workers Cup, its stars never wallow in self-pity but maintain a stoic dignity throughout. One lengthy group rumination on what it is to be a modern-day slave hoping for nothing more than freedom is particularly heartrending, while the sight of Kenneth and Paul having their faint hopes of following their sporting dreams matter?of?factly crushed would bring a tear to a glass eye.
The Workers Cup pulls off the impressive feat of having everything to do with football while having nothing to do with football. It should be required viewing for anyone with even the most passing interest in what is a beautiful but increasingly ugly game.

migrant workers on construction sites in Qatar, including those building stadiums for the 2022 World Cup, are being subjected to potentially life-threatening heat and humidity, according to new research on the extreme summer conditions in the Gulf. Hundreds of workers are dying every year, the campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said in a strong statement, but they claim that the Qatar authorities have refused to make necessary information public or adequately investigate the deaths, which could be caused by labouring in the regions fierce climate.
HRW argues that millions of workers are in jeopardy, including those in the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries  Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  because statutory work breaks imposed during summer midday hours do not protect them sufficiently. An analysis of the weather in Doha last summer has also shown that workers on World Cup construction projects were in danger, despite the more advanced system used by the tournament organiser, Humidex, which measures safety levels of heat and humidity.
Enforcing appropriate restrictions on outdoor work and regularly investigating and publicising information about worker deaths is essential to protect the health and lives of construction workers in Qatar, Sarah Leah Whitson, HRWs Middle East director, said. Limiting work hours to safe temperatures, not set by a clock or calendar, is well within the capacity of the Qatari government and will help protect hundreds of thousands of workers.
In 2012, the Qatari government revealed 520 people from Bangladesh, India and Nepal  whose citizens travel in their hundreds of thousands to do construction work in the Gulf  had died. Of these, 385, or almost three-quarters, had died from causes that the authorities neither explained nor investigated, HRW said. Last year the Qatari government told HRW that 35 workers died, mostly from falls, presumably at construction sites, but this did not take into account hundreds more people who died from heart attacks and other natural causes, patchily reported by their countries embassies and unexplained by the authorities.
The Supreme Committee organising the 2022 World Cup, which Fifa originally voted in 2010 could be played in the summer but has since been moved to winter, is striving to enact higher welfare standards than those generally applied for the two million migrant workers in Qatar. It has disclosed that 10 workers on World Cup projects died between October 2015 and July this year, classifying eight of these, three of them men in their 20s, as non-work related because they resulted from cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. HRW argues that these classifications are meaningless, effectively only a statement that the person has died because their heart and breathing stopped.
HRW said in its statement that such descriptions obscure the underlying cause of deaths and make it impossible to determine whether [the workers deaths] may be related to working conditions, such as heat stress.
One World Cup construction worker who died, Jaleshwar Prasad, 48, was stated by the Supreme Committee to have suffered cardiac arrest, with the hospital reporting that work duties were not a contributory factor. The temperature in Qatar the day before Prasad died, 26 April 2016, peaked at 39C, HRW said.
Nicholas McGeehan, who carried out the research for HRW, accused the Qatari government and the Supreme Committee of a wilful abdication of responsibility for the health and safety of workers.
Their heat protection system is inappropriate and data shows that its enforcement is seriously deficient, McGeehan said. That means they are putting stadium workers lives at risk.
Outdoor workers generally in Qatar must not be made to work between 11.30am and 3pm from 15 June to 31 August, according to a government decree issued in 2007. HRW describes that measure, which it said is broadly reproduced by the other GCC countries, as rudimentary because it does not relate breaks to the actual working conditions outside those hours.
Analysis of the UK Meteorological Office climate record for Doha last year, seen by the Guardian, showed that according to the Humidex measure, it was not safe for an acclimatised person to do even moderately strenuous work outside, for 1,176 hours, including night time. The statutory government break added up to only 273 hours last summer, while the Supreme Committee, using the Humidex system, said that it imposed only an additional 150 hours of breaks to that government total.
HRW has called on the Qatari and other Gulf country authorities, including the Supreme Committee, to use a different heat stress measure, the wet bulb global temperature (WBGT), which also takes sunlight into account, to avoid potentially fatal heat-related illnesses.
The extreme climate in the Gulf, measured against the WBGT and the Humidex system, makes working at almost any time of day or night in July, August and the first half of September dangerous, McGeehan said.
Approximately two million immigrants do the overwhelming bulk of manual work in Qatar, where the indigenous population, the worlds wealthiest on average due to the countrys vast reserves of natural gas, numbers only around 300,000. Approximately 800,000 men from the poorer south Asian countries work on the countrys huge construction projects, including 12,000, expected to rise to 35,000, building the World Cup stadiums. During the hot months, migrant workers are frequently the only people seen spending any extended time outside the countrys air-conditioned buildings and vehicles.
The HRW statement criticises the Qatari government for failing to implement the recommendations of a 2014 report by the law firm DLA Piper, which the government itself commissioned. The report followed an international outcry over the number of workers dying in Qatar just as the massive new infrastructure programme was being commissioned.
It noted that the number of deaths in Qatar attributed to cardiac arrest was seemingly high and called for transparent publication and investigation, including a legal reform to permit postmortem examinations in cases of sudden deaths. That recommendation has also not been implemented and legal constraints continue. HRW argues that this has prevented inquiries being conducted into how workers are dying and adequate measures being put in place to protect their health and safety.
We need data on deaths, new laws on heat protection and immediate investigations, otherwise the death toll will continue to rise, McGeehan said.
The Supreme Committee sent the Guardian a detailed explanation of how its breaks system works using the Humidex measure, and of the restrictions on postmortems in Qatar, but has not yet responded to the criticisms.
A spokesman for the Qatari government said it is committed to labour reforms, and confirmed that it did make public last year deaths and injuries that were work-related.
The government investigates all migrant worker deaths in Qatar and coordinates with the embassies of labour-sending countries to repatriate the deceased, the spokesman said."

In a culmination of hostilities simmering for years and accusations that Qatar is a major funder of terrorist organisations, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have closed the only land route into the tiny peninsula and refused to allow use of their sea ports or airspace.
The multibillion-dollar preparations to host the 2022 tournament, which involve building nine stadiums and huge infrastructure, is put into perspective by local reports that Qataris are so worried about the blockade that they are stocking up on food. The border with Saudi Arabia is the only road route into the country; Qatar relies on sea ports for its materials and the blockade of airspace is a huge logistical handicap to the country and its flagship airline, Qatar Airways.
The supreme committee responsible for building the 2022 World Cup facilities did not issue a public statement but a source acknowledged that the seriousness of the crisis is greater than any of the formidable challenges Qatar has faced since winning the vote in 2010 from Fifas now discredited executive committee. The tournament has been switched to the winter to avoid searing summer temperatures, a series of investigations has been held into strongly denied corruption allegations and there has been worldwide criticism of the countrys treatment of its migrant construction workers.
Saudi Arabia said in a statement that it had broken off physical and diplomatic contact due to Qatars embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region. Resentment has been growing for years, principally over Qatars support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, an organisation which the UAE vehemently opposes, but Saudi Arabia also accused Qatar of supporting al-Qaida and Islamic State, extremist groups which have carried out atrocities in the Middle East and Europe.
Qatar has always denied the accusations that it funds terrorist groups and its foreign ministry said in a statement responding to the blockade: The state of Qatar has been subjected to a campaign of lies that have reached the point of complete fabrication. It reveals a hidden plan to undermine the state of Qatar.
Qatars ruling family and emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, have always intended that hosting an event as globally captivating as the World Cup will dramatically boost the tiny but wealthy countrys profile, and that such soft power could help be a bulwark against interference from its neighbours. Now, although there are five years to go, the entire project is facing major doubt.
The English Football Association did not comment on the crisis but the German FA (DFB) president, Reinhard Grindel, said he would discuss it with the German government and Uefa. Grindel promised to look for a political solution but said: The football community worldwide should agree that  major tournaments should not be played in countries that actively support terror.
Fifa, now sponsored by Qatar Airways, declined to comment except to say: Fifa is in regular contact with the Qatar 2022 local organising committee and the supreme committee for delivery & legacy handling matters relating to the 2022 Fifa World Cup."

This corrupt system starts with recruitment under false pretences in their home countries and entraps them once they set foot in Qatar. Talking to workers in the squalid labour camps has brought home to me how these proud young men, who have left home to build a future, are deprived of dignity and treated in the most inhumane way. Worse, in the years that Ive been visiting the camps, nothing has changed.
Hundreds of these workers succumb every year to the appalling living and working conditions, returning to their home countries in coffins, their deaths callously written off as the price of progress.
The worlds richest country is spending £400m a week on the huge infrastructure programme for 2022, but paying the workers who are making it happen as little as £8 a day. There is no minimum wage, no unions are allowed and even basic protections at work are lacking for most.
Winning the World Cup bid could have been a catalyst for change in Qatar, but it has not been yet. Certainly, nothing has improved for the families of the 13 workers who died in a company labour camp fire last June, or for the 500 workers who lost all their possessions in two more labour camp fires this year. They were offered only $50 in compensation and had to rely on charity for food, clothes and bedding.
Qatars PR machine is still unable to hide the truth. Its government told the UNs International Labour Organisation this month that the exit permit regime for migrant workers has been repealed  a blatant lie.
Workers still have to get their employers permission to change jobs and even to leave the country. Appeals to a government committee are being refused at a rate of five a day. Workers learn by text message if they can leave the country or not, and many have been waiting for a month for a decision. The fate of French footballer Zahir Belounis, who was trapped in Qatar for 19 months by his clubs owners after a wage dispute, can befall any one of the nearly 2 million migrant workers there, at any time.
At the ILO, worker and employer delegates are keeping up the pressure on Qatar. Indeed, some multinational construction companies seeking improvement want to negotiate with the global construction union Building and Woodworkers International. But the government wont allow even that.
Right now, countries need to stand up at the ILO and elsewhere to Qatars financial muscle and oppose its use of modern slavery. Those that dont will be held to account.
The Qatari government has repeatedly failed to keep its pledge to reform in the years since it was awarded the World Cup. Each time I have spoken to government representatives, promises are made  but usually the same promises they made the last time we spoke.
Fifa, too, has a heavy burden of responsibility, by not making real reform a requirement for hosting its most prestigious and profitable event. Players and fans do care if the tournament is delivered on the basis of slavery, exploitation and death.
Fifa and other global sports bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, are making human rights a requirement in future bids for major events but, right now, Qatars migrant workers urgently need real backing from footballs ultimate authority, as it strives to revive its battered reputation.

attention as Vishnukanth Thapar nonchalantly sweeps past to open the front door of the Career Wings travel agency. Seconds after stepping into a shabby, ground-floor office he stops at a wooden shrine adorned with Hindu deities, bowing his head and joining his hands to pay obeisance before the days work begins. There is a lot to be thankful for.
The men are summoned, gathering around a large wooden desk as they provide verbal CVs and contact details. Todays offering includes eight bricklayers, three metal workers, six HGV drivers and a dozen labourers. As he busily scribbles notes, a bell rings on Thapars mobile, announcing the arrival of an email, which he flicks open with his finger. After reading it, he looks up to proclaim: I need drivers and labourers. Who wants to go? They all hold up their hands.
Behind the benign name and a misleading advertising hoarding offering services such as Tourist PR (sic) and luxury holidays, accompanied by eye-catching photographs of London and Sydney, Career Wings specialises in an altogether different form of foreign travel. And business has never been so brisk, driven by Qatars preparations for the 2022 World Cup, which has led to a construction boom and an unprecedented demand for labour in the Gulf state.
There are an estimated 1.8 million migrant workers already in Qatar, with 600,000 Indians and 500,000 Nepalese making up the largest number, followed by those from other south Asian countries. The gas-rich nation is spending about £400m a week on infrastructure projects, directly or indirectly related to footballs most prestigious tournament, and the demand for labour is expected to increase over the coming year as work intensifies.
It all represents rich pickings for the likes of Thapar, whose business forms part of a flourishing, pernicious chain that begins in remote villages in India and other south Asian countries and ends on the bustling hi-tech construction sites of Qatar. Human rights activists describe it as a form of modern-day slavery.
Located in Nawanshahr, in the north Indian state of Punjab, Career Wings is one of 150 unregistered recruitment agencies dominating the streets of the provincial town of almost 50,000 people. Middlemen often bring in potential workers from surrounding villages. Once recruiters like Thapar have taken their details, they are referred to registered agents in the city of Jalandhar nearby, who make the final arrangements and award the jobs.
Thapar demands £100 from each worker who secures a job through the agency he deals with in Jalandhar, which provides him with daily updates on the types of workers it requires. Village recruiters usually charge about £50. The main agencies demand between £400 and £800. The result is that workers can end up paying up to £1,000 or more in illegal commissions.
I dont care what happens to them once they get to Qatar, Thapar says dismissively. I just send them to the big agents in Jalandhar. I just feed the monster.
The treatment of migrant World Cup workers in Qatar returns to the spotlight this week when the International Labour Organisation debates proposals at its annual meeting in Geneva to force the country to implement labour reforms or face a commission of inquiry. This is the highest sanction of the UN agency, which is made up of trade unions, employers groups and government representatives from 187 member states, including Qatar, India and other south Asia nations. Central to the demands for the inquiry is the recruitment process.
Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, whose members sit on the ILO, said: It is highly exploitative. Laws are not being enforced and nobody is policing the system. Those involved are making a fortune at the expense of the workers. We demand an inquiry because we believe that Qatar is not serious about addressing how migrant workers are treated in recruitment and other key areas.
Indian law states that only registered agents can recruit workers for jobs abroad and the maximum commission they can charge is £250 or the equivalent of 45 days salary (whichever is less).
They are also not allowed to use unlicensed sub-agents, such as Thapar. All workers have to be provided with contracts before departure and agents also have to ensure that employers adhere to the stipulated pay and conditions.
For those hoping to go to Qatar, there is little awareness of their rights or knowledge about the 2022 World Cup. They are motivated by a golden opportunity to improve their lives by significantly increasing their pay.
In the village of Langroya, 10 minutes away from Nawanshahr, Arvinder Kumar, 25, is one of scores of young men eager to go to Qatar. He now earns £50 a month as a plumber and has been offered work by a recruitment agency promising him more than £350 a month. In return, it is demanding £500 commission.
Kumar is well aware of the pitfalls. His cousin Jaswinder recently returned after two years in Qatar. A qualified electrician, his contract said he would be paid £400 a month but he received just over half that. He stayed because he had a loan to pay off and because his salary was still six times more than what he earned in India.
Langroya and other villages across Punjab, a state that provides some of the largest numbers of migrant workers to the Gulf region, are awash with similar stories of workers being exploited by agents at home and employers in Qatar and its neighbouring countries.
We all know that we are going to be cheated. First in India and then when we go abroad, so it doesnt matter what the law states because it wont make any difference. I dont know anything about the World Cup or football, I just know that there is work in Qatar, said Kumar. But we are promised one thing and then get something completely different. Ultimately, its just a question of fate and luck.
Paramjit Kaur Minhas has an equally resigned approach in her quest to contact the agent who sent her husband Saroop to Qatar last year and establish why he has not been paid for two months. He was charged £800 commission for a job as a lorry driver ferrying construction material which was supposed to earn him £425 a month, but this was reduced after he was involved in an accident and his employer docked part of his wages. In India he was earning £60 a month as a bus driver.
Minhas, 36, who lives in the village of Dahumunda with their children Gursharanpreet, 15, and Gurjot, five, said: My husband had no choice but to go to Qatar because we have a family to raise and bills to pay and we couldnt survive on what he was earning here.
Each time I ring the agent to ask why Saroop hasnt been paid, he just hangs up the phone or tells me he will look into the matter. My husband is too afraid to complain to his boss because he might lose his job. People are desperate in these parts, thats why they go abroad for work but its disgraceful the way they are treated.
The world needs to know whats going on but nobody is interested in helping us.
In neighbouring Nepal, the situation is equally perilous. Amnesty International is to publish a report on the recruitment of workers going to Qatar later this year and estimates that there are up to 80,000 unregistered agents, charging commissions as exorbitant as those in India. Under local law, these are meant to be capped at £76 and all workers are supposed to be issued with a free ticket and visa.
Angela Sherwood, Amnestys migrants rights researcher, who spent several months travelling around Nepal to compile the report, said: There are rules in place to regulate labour recruitment but governments are not putting any resources into implementing them. There is a need for better monitoring and we want the authorities in south Asia and Qatar to take action to reduce the vulnerability of migrant workers.
Campaigners claim that one of the main reasons why south Asian governments are reluctant to enforce existing laws or complain about how their citizens are treated in Qatar is because they are desperate for them to find work due to high unemployment. Migrant workers also play a crucial role in the economy. According to World Bank figures, last year Indians sent home almost £55bn, the bulk from the Gulf region, while foreign remittances account for almost 30% of Nepals gross domestic product.
The recruitment process is only one of a number of criticisms levelled against Qatar over the World Cup. Others include workers being underpaid, poor living and working conditions and the kafala sponsorship system, which prevents them from changing jobs or leaving the country without the employers permission.
The ITUC claimed in December 2015 that as many as 7,000 migrant workers will die on World Cup-related projects by the time the tournament kicks off, which was denied by the Qatari government. A report by Amnesty International last March, which focused on migrant workers building the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, which is expected to host World Cup matches all the way up to the semi-finals, found they were living in squalid accommodation, with the majority not being paid for several months and employers confiscating their passports and not issuing them with exit permits to return home.
In response to mounting pressure, Qatar announced a number of reforms last December heralding that it had ended the kafala system. The government said at the time that it was committed to the development of a labour system that is fair to employers and employees alike. These legislative changes, combined with ongoing enforcement and a commitment to systemic reform, not just in Qatar but also in countries of origin, will ensure workers rights are respected across the entire labour pathway.
Critics protest that the reforms have been little more than window dressing and that considerable loopholes remain, meaning the kafala system and other repressive labour laws exist under different names. Trade unions remain banned, while employers are still able to stop workers from changing jobs for up to five years. Passport confiscation, officially outlawed, is also permissible under certain circumstances.
Trade unionists also claim that no action has been taken to address the recruitment process, which they want to be managed by credible international agencies operating to the highest corporate standards. As the wealthy, influential player in the labour chain, they insist that Qatar is best placed to enforce change.
Kasi Ram (not his real name), a trade union organiser working secretly in Qatar, said: It is Qatar that needs the workers and is in the best position to ensure that they are treated properly and fairly because, compared to India and Nepal, it is far richer and more powerful. But these are reforms in name only, the reality is that nothing has changed on the ground. The workers are exploited every step of the way, from the moment they step into a recruiting agents office right up to living and working in Qatar.
The Indian government maintains that it is implementing a number of measures to clamp down on rogue labour recruiters, such as instructing state-level police to take action and doubling agent registration fees to £60,000. However, its own figures show that only 24 prosecutions took place over the past three years, despite almost 700 complaints.
Qatar, meanwhile, has been vociferously lobbying ILO members in the run-up to this weeks debate to persuade them to drop demands for an inquiry, arguing that its reforms will take time to bed in. It also continues to push ahead with its nine new state-of-the-art, temperature-controlled stadiums, an entire city outside of Doha, shopping malls, transport links, several roads, a new central sewage system and 20 skyscrapers.
With an estimated final cost of £160bn, the 2022 World Cup is expected to be the most expensive in the tournaments history, but those being recruited to transform Qatars football dream into reality are already paying a high price.

That eye-watering level of spending could continue until 2021, Ali Shareef Al-Emadi said on Tuesday.
We are spending close to $500m per week on capital projects, he told journalists.
And this will carry on for the next three to four years to achieve our goal and objective of really getting the country ready for 2022.
More than $200bn (187bn) will be spent in total by the gas-rich Emirate in preparation for 2022.
Emadi said this figure covered not only stadiums but huge and costly projects such as roads, a new airport and hospitals.
90% of the 2022 contracts have already been awarded, added Emadi.
That doesnt mean the stadiums only, we are talking about highways, rail, ports, airports, those are really underway, even hospitals and everything.
He added: We are really giving ourselves a good chance of delivering things on time and we dont want to get in a place that we start painting while people are coming to the country.
Asked if this would make Qatars tournament the most expensive World Cup ever, the minister said no.
We are putting $200bn in terms of infrastructure... If you look at stand alone, the World Cup, no it is not.
Emadi, who was speaking to a group of international journalists on a government-invited press trip, said the money for World Cup projects had been protected from cuts despite Qatar experiencing budget constraints in recent times because of energy price fluctuations.
Last year, Qatar ran an estimated budget deficit of more than $12bn, its first in 15 years.
The state budget for 2017 was approved with a deficit of $7.7bn.
Qatar, which has the worlds third-largest natural gas reserves and produces up to 800,000 barrels of oil a day, has been forced to tighten its belt following a 2014 collapse in the price of crude.
The market has now partially recovered and Emadi said that Qatar is very comfortable with current oil prices.
Asked if Qatar would consider financing its deficit by selling debt on international bond markets this year, he said no final decision had yet been taken by the government.
In consort with other Gulf nations, Qatar will introduce a Value Added Tax, probably in 2018.
He denied that this could pave the way for an eventual introduction of an income tax in Qatar."

The relevant authorities have been notified and the next of kin has been informed. An immediate investigation into the cause of this fatality is under way and further details will be released in due course.
The Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy shares our deepest condolences with the family for their loss.
Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP, Labours shadow sports minister, said: My thoughts go out to the friends and family of the person who tragically died working on a construction site in Qatar. It is unacceptable that basic health and safety precautions are not being followed. Fifa and the Qatari authorities should not be putting profit before safety.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino needs to show where his priorities lie, launch an urgent investigation and ensure everything is done to protect workers.

The innovative technology uses a solar-powered fan to reduce the skin temperature by up to 10 degrees, said the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the body overseeing the controversial tournaments organisation.
We are confident that this technology will create more comfortable and safer working conditions, said Saud Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Ghani, an engineering professor at Qatar University, where the hat has been developed.
The cooling hat scheme could be rolled out by next summer, officials said.
Summertime temperatures in Qatar regularly approach 50C (122F).
Our objective was to reduce heat stress and heat strokes for workers in Qatar and the region during the summer months, said Abdul-Ghani.
Our concept is to use a solar-powered fan to blow air over a cooled material at the top of the helmet, which will then come down over the front of the persons face and provide a cooler micro-climate for the worker.
It would provide cooling in hot conditions for up to four hours straight, he added and could revolutionise the construction industry in the hottest parts of the world.
Workers in Qatar will be the first to use the helmet, which has been two years in the making, said Hilal Jeham al-Kuwari, an engineer with the supreme committee.
Since 2007, labourers have been banned from working outside in Qatar for several hours during the day at the height of the summer, due to temperatures.
There are currently more than 5,000 construction workers helping build World Cup stadiums in Qatar. That number is set to increase to 36,000 within the next two years.
Qatar has come under huge international criticism for the treatment of its migrant labour force ever since being chosen to host the 2022 World Cup.
Earlier this year, Amnesty International accused Qatar of using forced labour at a World Cup site, the Khalifa International Stadium.
In October, it was revealed that Anil Kumar Pasman, a 29-year-old Nepalese labourer, had died after being struck by a lorry at Al-Wakrah stadium, the first work-related fatality announced by Qatars World Cup organisers."

A law change that comes into effect on Tuesday, which Qatar says guarantees greater flexibility, freedom and protection for workers, will not significantly change the exploitative relationship between employers and workers, said the rights group.
The Gulf state is spending an estimated $200bn on new transport infrastructure, housing and sports facilities, including six stadiums designed by architects including Lord Foster and the late Zaha Hadid. Construction for the 2022 World Cup will peak in the coming two years, and Spanish champions FC Barcelona are due to play an exhibition match in Doha on Tuesday.
But Qatars kafala system, which is used to recruit the majority of its workforce from countries including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, has prompted international outcry because it prevents workers from changing jobs or leaving the country without a permit. It is alleged to have resulted in modern-day slavery for some workers.
Qatar said on Monday it was abolishing kafala and that it was enormously grateful to the millions of workers who have come to Qatar to build our nations infrastructure during this period of rapid change.
But James Lynch, deputy director for global issues at Amnesty, said the new law may get rid of the word sponsorship but it leaves the same basic system intact.
It is good that Qatar has accepted that its laws were fuelling abuse but these inadequate changes will continue to leave workers at the mercy of exploitative bosses, he said.
Amnesty has warned Fifa that it cannot continue to remain shamefully ambivalent to the plight of workers in Qatar and said FC Barcelona should make clear to their hosts their desire to play in a human rights-friendly environment. Players and clubs cannot live in a bubble.
Lynch, a former British diplomat in Doha, said that in practice employers would still be able to stop migrant workers from leaving the country and that, by making it easier for employers to confiscate workers passports, the new law could make the situation worse.
The tragedy is that many workers think that this new law will be the end of their ordeal, he said.
In a statement, the government of Qatar said it fundamentally rejects Amnesty Internationals claims.
Issa bin Saad al-Jafali al-Nuaimi, a minister of labour, said Qatar was replacing the kafala system with a modernised contract-based system that safeguards worker rights and increases job flexibility.
The ministry of administrative development, labour and social affairs said migrant workers would be free to leave the country if their employer allowed them and could appeal to a committee if their request was rejected. Workers who have completed fixed-term contracts would be free to move jobs, while those on rolling contracts would be free to move if they have completed five years of service. Employers who confiscate passports will be fined up to QAR25,000 (£5,400). However, Amnesty says the new law also makes holding passports legal if a worker requests it in writing and argues that this could be abused because employers in Qatar enjoy a disproportionate level of influence and control over their employees.
For a migrant worker, the prospect of being tied to one employer for up to five years, unable to change employer to secure better conditions or escape poor treatment or abuse, is not greatly different from their current position and will not significantly reduce the risk of coercion of workers by their employers, said Lynch.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is due to make a judgment in March on whether the forced labour of migrant workers in Qatars construction industry warrants further investigation.
Amnesty is now calling on the Qatari authorities to abolish the exit permit system, prohibit all passport confiscation and ensure that workers can change jobs without requiring the permission of their employer.
Al-Nuaimi said: We urge the international community not to draw any definitive conclusions until there has been time to see the new law in action."

The Netherlands Trade Union Confederation confirmed on Thursday that Fifa has been summoned to appear in the commercial court in Zürich in a case it has brought against the world governing body on behalf of the Bangladeshi migrant worker, Nadim Sharaful Alam. The Confederation also confirmed that the Bangladesh Free Trade Union Congress (BFTUC) and the Bangladesh Building and Wood Workers Federation (BBWWF) are also supporting the action.
The Swiss court is asked to rule that Fifa acted wrongfully by selecting Qatar for the World Cup 2022 without demanding the assurance that Qatar observes fundamental human and labour rights of migrant construction workers, including the abolition of the Kafala system, read a statement from the Netherlands Trade Union Confederation (FNV). The Swiss court is furthermore requested to rule that, in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup, Fifa ensures that the rights of migrant construction workers are safeguarded, by insisting on adequate and effective labour reforms in Qatar, that are actually implemented.
The Bangladeshi Unions BFTUC and BBWWF have decided to join the case as many of their members left Bangladesh to work in Qatar. These unions are actively engaged with issues pertaining to the rights of migrant workers and in the global fight for the protection of the rights of migrant workers in Middle East, specifically Qatar.
Fifa was made aware of the claim on 10 October and quickly rejected the allegations made against them. Four months earlier, Federico Addiechi, Fifas head of sustainability, also released a statement in response to a critical report from Amnesty International in which he insisted the governing body is fully committed to do its utmost to ensure that human rights are respected on all Fifa World Cup sites and operations and services directly related to the Fifa World Cup.
While the damages sought by Alam are relatively modest, if the action is successful it could open the door for hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to make similar claims that could run into tens of millions of pounds and further damage the credibility of a tournament that has faced intense criticism ever since Fifa voted in December 2010 to hold the World Cup in the tiny Gulf state."

Greg Hands, junior minister at the Department for International Trade, was in Qatar on Wednesday for a conference in Doha called Sport is Great, billed as an opportunity for UK companies to meet with key decision-makers and buyers actively looking to procure services to support projects in the run-up to the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
Amnesty International said it was extremely disappointing that Hands had not spoken out about human rights ahead of the visit, saying Qatars construction sector was rife with abuse.
Human Rights Watch said Hands seemed to be making an obsequious sales pitch, and that UK companies should beware of the risks to reputation of involvement in Qatars construction boom.
The awarding of the World Cup to Qatar has proved hugely controversial, particularly the treatment of the thousands of foreign workers, mainly from south Asian nations, many of whom have been put up in squalid accommodation, had their pay withheld or delayed, and their passports confiscated.
Fifa faces legal action in the Swiss courts over its alleged complicity in the mistreatment, amid calls for footballs world governing body to move the 2022 tournament away from the Gulf state.
Hands department said it would check whether the minister planned to raise any human rights concerns with his hosts. However, Hands did not mention them in an article published on Wednesday in the Peninsula, an English language newspaper in Qatar.
The article praised the absolute monarchys ambitious sporting vision in securing the World Cup, as well as last months cycling Road World Championships, and the World Athletics Championships in 2019.
This is an exciting time for Qatars vision, and the UK has the opportunity to be a strategic partner to ensure all these events are as successful as possible for spectators, competitors and organisers alike, Hands wrote, saying Britain had a world-leading capability in delivering global sports events.
Hands ended the article by saying he was looking forward to touring some of the sites where nations will be pinning their hopes of World Cup victory in 2022, adding that he took great pride in the involvement of UK companies in the endeavour.
Amnesty International UKs head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth, said: Greg Hands job involves banging the drum for trade, but its extremely disappointing he couldnt find room in his article to make even a passing mention of the dangerous and exploitative conditions many of the migrant labourers building Qatars gleaming new sports venues find themselves in.
The stadiums, roads and other infrastructure for World Cup 2022 are being constructed by often poorly paid people from places like India and Nepal  migrant workers who routinely have their passports confiscated and regularly work excessively long hours in intolerably hot and dangerous conditions.
Qatars construction sector is rife with abuse, as we and others have been highlighting for years. Wed like Mr Hands to raise this with his hosts in Doha and show he understands that the 2022 World Cup shouldnt be based on violating the human rights of hundreds of thousands of exploited workers.
Nicholas McGeehan, the Qatar, UAE and Bahrain researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: Its understandable that the UK government wants to ensure British companies get as many construction and engineering contracts as possible, but Greg Hands should be mindful of the fact that Qatars construction market poses serious legal and reputational risks to UK firms on account of the Qatari governments stubborn refusal to meaningfully reform its labour system or investigate an alarming pattern of unexplained migrant worker deaths.
The ministers article reads like an obsequious sales pitch, but in that sense it is fairly consistent with the UK governments approach to the Gulf states."

With the formal backing of the Netherlands Trade Union Confederation, a Bangladeshi man named Nadim Sharaful Alam is to sue Fifa for its alleged complicity in the mistreatment of those migrant workers in Qatar who are charged with building its World Cup venues and infrastructure. (Suggested tournament slogan: Believe The Mirage.)
In what amounts to a test case, Alam is threatening to sue world footballs governing body via the Swiss courts unless Fifa settles with him. According to the legal argument presented in the writ of summons to Fifa, the governing body has violated applicable legal standards under Swiss law protecting migrant workers from forced labour and other forms of exploitation. For the hardships that he endured while Building The Dream, Alam is asking for the equivalent of $5,000. For material damages compensation, just under the same sum again.
So what does 10 grand buy you in Alams world? His case is that in 2014, the then 29-year-old paid the equivalent of $4,000 on account to a recruiter who led him to understand that a construction firm had sponsored him and he was to be employed as an unskilled labourer. Under the less rosy realities of the countrys forced-labour kafala system, Alams passport was taken from him and he was forced to work 18-hour days for nearly a year and a half. During what well sarcastically call his downtime, he was confined to a World Cup workers camp, where he was naturally required to pay for his meals. In a cute and doubtless entirely coincidental instance of timing, he was fired before he had repaid his recruitment fee, whereupon he was deported penniless back to Bangladesh. He had mortgaged his land back home to pay the initial instalment to the recruiter, and is now unable to pay the debt.
As I say, that little jolly consumed 17 backbreaking and cruelly fruitless months of Alams existence. In contrast, let us consider the figures attached to a mere four days  four days!  in the life of Gianni Infantino, the Solomon Grundy of a Fifa president who was appointed on a Monday and embroiled in an ethics investigation by the Tuesday, before being cleared on the Wednesday. I paraphrase only slightly. Still, what does 10 grand buy you in the world of the chap who will undoubtedly bat away Alams request for compensation, pour encourager les autres?
Let us examine a single document in the now-settled ethics case against the Fifa president, concerning his use of private jets. According to this letter to the ethics committee, despite Fifa having booked him commercial flights between Geneva, Moscow, Doha, and Zurich over four days in April, Infantino rejected these in favour of accepting private jet flights paid for by Russia and Qatar. The total value of the private jet invitations are in a range of at least approx $115,000 to $150,000, the letter states, depending on aircraft and ferry-flights, even more. Needless to say, this does not include standard Fifa expenses such as hotel rooms, cars, dinners and other sundries. Unlike Alam, for instance, I imagine the Fifa president likes his Doha water bottled, rather than dispensed by a desert standpipe.
Ah well. There are always two different World Cups. When Fifa bigwigs blather on about any tournament, you can always predict exactly which version of it is going to turn up. Either the World Cup pretty much has the power to heal the planet and is an incredibly transformative thing  which is why you increasingly have to award it to non-democracies. Or it is only a game, and really cant be held accountable for whatever it is youve discovered is being done in its name, even if it profits you obscenely. I dont want to go out on a limb here, but which version do we imagine Infantino falls back on when he tells Alam and his modest plea to do one?
Like all women, I am shocked by the idea that either Donald Trump or Nigel Farage has been inside a locker room inside the past two decades  or even since school. Indeed, each time I consider these chaps assured mention of the locker room, I find my mind wandering to the inevitable. Which is (but of course): what sport would Nigel and Donald have been playing just before the sexual-assault-reminiscences warmdown?
Is there anything more preposterous than the notion of Trump playing even a bit of pitch and putt with little Barron, before losing interest and offloading it to the help? The idea of The Donald playing any form of sport is almost more bonkers than the idea of him being leader of the free world.
I am reminded of an oblique remark made by his own devoted former butler, shortly after hed shown a reporter the sensationally bad portrait of his boss in costume cricket whites in the library bar of his Floridian estate. To wit: Mr Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks.
If I really stretch my imagination, I can just about picture both Nigel and Donald playing racketball incredibly angrily and atrociously for around three minutes, Farage in black office socks with white plimsolls, and Trump with those mid-calf efforts and trainers with a wide heel flare recommended by the American Orthotics Association.
But really, two less credible denizens of a locker room I can scarcely contemplate. I assume there is already a horrendously niche strain of slash fiction devoted to what happens when these two finish chuckling about pussy-grabbing and head for the showers. But it is surely best left to the alt-right completists."

alleged complicity in the mistreatment of migrant workers in Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup, the Guardian can reveal.
Since Fifa voted in December 2010 to hold the World Cup in the tiny Gulf state, Qatar has faced intense criticism over the plight of an army of migrant workers that soared to 1.7 million as the country embarked on a construction spree to build the stadiums and infrastructure required.
But the legal challenge, brought by the Netherlands Trade Union Confederation (FNV) on behalf of a Bangladeshi migrant worker called Nadim Sharaful Alam, is the first time that Fifa has been made directly accountable in the Swiss courts.
In a letter sent to world footballs governing body, which almost collapsed in the wake of a 2015 corruption scandal, on Sunday night lawyers acting for FNV and Alam have given Fifas new president, Gianni Infantino, three weeks to accept its complicity and pay damages before going to court.
While the damages sought by Alam are relatively modest, if the action is successful it could open the door for hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to make similar claims that could run into tens of millions of pounds.
Fifa has consistently argued that while it does not have responsibility for wider societal problems in host countries, it is doing what it can to make the Qatar World Cup a catalyst for change by engaging with the Qatar government to ensure satisfactory conditions for workers on World Cup stadium sites.
But critics including major NGOs and trade unions have argued that Fifa should do more to use its influence to push for improvement for workers on related infrastructure projects and for wider changes to the kafala system that has been compared to a form of modern slavery.
In a letter to Infantino accompanying a draft writ that could be lodged in the Swiss courts, lawyers call on Fifa to acknowledge that it has acted wrongfully by awarding the World Cup 2022 to Qatar without demanding the assurance that Qatar observes fundamental human and labour rights vis-à-vis migrant construction workers whose work is related to the 2022 World Cup.
It says that Fifa should have demanded the abolition of the kafala system, the guarantee of the right of migrant workers to change jobs, freedom for them to leave Qatar if and when they chose to and the right to unionise.
The letter adds: Alternatively Fifa should acknowledge that it should not have awarded the World Cup 2022 to Qatar.
Infantino is also called upon to acknowledge that Fifa violated the rights of Alam, a Bangladeshi who worked in Qatar as an unskilled labourer between 2014 and 2016, and asks for compensation for material damages of 5,390.53 Swiss francs and just satisfaction to the amount of CHF 5,000 for the hardships he endured.
Under the heading wrongful acts committed by Fifa, the summary of the writ says that Swiss law, but also Qatari law and international law oblige Fifa to respect fundamental human rights and refrain from wrongdoing.
It adds: Fifas legal responsibility arose at two distinctive moments in time: (1) when it allowed Qatar to participate in the bidding contest for the World Cup 2022 and subsequently selected Qatar as host of the 2022 World Cup; and (2) when it failed and still is failing to take responsibility for the present fate of the migrant workers by not demanding Qatar to reform its labour system.
While the initial focus following the controversial decision was on possible health problems for players and fans associated with playing the tournament in temperatures of 45C and the corruption allegations that surrounded the vote, a series of damning reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a Guardian investigation led to a global outcry.
The Qatari government commissioned law firm DLA Piper to write a report but more than two years after it was made public in May 2014 its recommendations have not yet been implemented in full and no progress has been made on cataloguing how many migrant workers are killed or injured while working in the country.
Some practical changes have been made, such as the requirement to pay salaries electronically, and new laws proposed, but campaigners believe they will do little to address the underlying structural issues and represent a rebranding rather than a repealing of the kafala system.
The 2022 organising committee has built much improved accommodation for those working directly on stadium developments, but for the vast majority of workers on related infrastructure projects conditions remain abject.
Critics also complain that too little is being done to clamp down on unscrupulous recruitment agencies in countries such as Nepal, India and Bangladesh that charge large sums for workers to find jobs in Qatar and then demand repayment.
As recently as June Qatar was accused of appalling treatment of migrant workers by a critical Amnesty International report.
Fifa, which earlier this year published a report from human rights expert Prof John Ruggie of Harvard University and promised to implement his recommendations, has continually claimed that it cant be held responsible for working conditions but hopes to use the World Cup to bring about change. It has also attempted to suggest that its responsibility only extends as far as the World Cup stadiums.
But the lawsuit argues that the World Cup has vastly accelerated Qatars construction development efforts, pointing to new metro lines, the new city of Lusail that will house the stadium set to host the final and new highway and bridge projects.
The World Cup 2022 is the motivating force behind all these vast infrastructural projects, all scheduled to be completed before the tournament, on time for the influx of tourists expected, it says.
The writ further argues that Fifa has the required mechanisms to force host countries to comply with whatever conditions it sets down.
In order to host the World Cup, Qatar had to take part in a bidding procedure. Fifa defines the terms for participation in the bidding procedure and is able to create legally binding obligations of the host state vis-à-vis Fifa, it said.
Prof Liesbeth Zegveld, an attorney for Dutch human rights lawyers Prakken dOliveira, is bringing the case alongside David Huesmann of Swiss law firm Shadenanwaelte.
Fifa may claim that it can do nothing but that is not the case. The union would rather see the World Cup stay in Qatar and for the country to meet its responsibilities to migrant workers but Fifa could still move the World Cup if it wanted to, said Zegveld.
We met with senior Qatari officials and they said they needed time to introduce new laws. They may say they need time but in reality they are just buying time. In any case, the new laws do too little to change the fundamental problems facing migrant workers and will mean little unless they are enforced.
A spokesperson for FNV, the biggest union in the Netherlands with 1.1 million members, said that while there had been some progress towards improving conditions, things were moving far too slowly.
The FNV takes the view that by awarding the World Cup to Qatar, the suffering of migrants increases. In any case, in situations like these, the number of migrant workers will increase. The FNV holds the Fifa responsible for this and wants to address the issue by means of this lawsuit, the spokesperson said.
Of course there have been improvements. Some of the migrant workers have better housing. But it is moving too slowly for the migrant workers themselves. It is really going too slowly. Migrant workers die under suspicious circumstances every year, added the spokesperson.
The world must do everything that is possible in order to change this situation. And if you expect the world to do this, you have to begin by taking responsibility yourself. That is why FNV is taking the matter to its source, and is holding the Fifa responsible.
The new Fifa council, rebranded from the old disgraced executive committee and expanded to 36 members, meets in Zurich this week. Since Infantino took over from Sepp Blatter in February, he has insisted that Fifa is turning over a new leaf.
While Fifa cannot and indeed does not have the responsibility to solve all the societal problems in a host country of a Fifa World Cup, Fifa has taken concrete action and is fully committed to do its utmost to ensure that human rights are respected on all Fifa World Cup sites and operations and services directly related to the Fifa World Cup, said Fifas head of sustainability, Federico Addiechi, in June in response to the critical Amnesty International report."

will have to consider the future of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar if its record on the treatment of migrant workers does not improve within 12 months, according to the Harvard professor who has authored an independent report commissioned by world footballs governing body into its human rights responsibilities.
Fifa has come under fire over its failure to consider human rights issues in host countries including Brazil, Russia and Qatar and its reluctance to exert its influence to improve the situation.
In particular, the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar building the infrastructure to host the 2022 tournament has come under the spotlight following a series of investigations by NGOs and the Guardian.
Professor John Ruggies report makes 25 explicit recommendations, praising Fifa for making a start in addressing the situation by commissioning the report  but he said it must match its words with action.
The foundational shift for Fifa now is to go beyond putting words on paper and adding new administrative functions, he concludes. What is required is a cultural shift that must affect everything Fifa does and how it does it.
Ruggie said that among the immediate priorities must be addressing human rights risks in tournaments that have already been scheduled and following through on promises to include such criteria in the bidding requirements for the 2026 World Cup.
The report read: Fifa should include human rights within its criteria for evaluating bids to host tournaments and should make them a substantive factor in host selection.
Another of the recommendations states: Fifa should set explicit human rights requirements of Local Organising Committees in bidding documents for tournaments and provide guidance on them.
On Qatar, Ruggie noted that the International Labour Organisation had recently given Qatar 12 months to end migrant worker exploitation or face a formal inquiry by the United Nations.
This month an Amnesty report claimed that despite repeated promises of action by the Qatari administration, it found ongoing abuse of migrant workers on a World Cup stadium project and a related development.
This week the Guardian revealed that two major British firms had been accused of mistreating migrant workers on construction projects not directly related to the World Cup but part of the huge building boom that has characterised the tiny Gulf states attempt to vault on to the world stage.
Fifa cant impose human rights on countries but in return for hosting a tournament there are certain human rights to which you should have to adhere, Ruggie told the Guardian. If you cant, you have to make tough decisions. That may include having to terminate an existing relationship.
Asked specifically about Qatar, he said: The ILO has recently put out an assessment in which they put off a decision for a year. They didnt want to shut the door. The next ILO report will be absolutely critical. If it says six to seven years later that no progress has been made then thats pretty clear.
He added: I think the ILO was being quite strategic in what they did. My sense is that the Supreme Committee will do everything humanly possible to meet the tests. If it doesnt, Fifa has a tough decision.
The Supreme Committee, responsible for the World Cup, has introduced minimum standards for its contractors and there has been some progress more widely on living standards for some workers.
However, human rights groups claim too little progress has been made on sweeping away the kafala system that bonds labourers to their employer and has been likened to modern slavery.
Ruggie also said there were major human rights issues facing the Russia 2018 World Cup. There is stuff happening in Russia that hasnt been much written about in terms of forcible removal of people, migrant labour issues, like there was in Sochi [before the 2014 Winter Olympics], he said. That should be all part of the conversation.
He raised an alarm about the Under-20 womens World Cup, which will take place in Papua New Guinea in November and December. I was shocked by how little interest that had generated within Fifa when we know that multinational organisations will not allow women to go on the streets in broad daylight.
The report adds: Papua New Guinea is known as one of the worlds worst places for sexual violence against women  and police are often among the perpetrators. This is precisely the kind of case that requires heightened human rights due diligence as part of the bid evaluation process.
With the decision already taken, the report calls on Fifa to prove that adequate security arrangements are being made to address the risks.
The report said that it was not enough for Fifa to claim it had limited influence, calling on it to work to maximise its leverage on human rights issues. Ruggie said: Its leverage concerns the activities involved in hosting and staging a tournaments. It requires the LOCs to get declarations from governments. They all have human rights implications.
Ruggie, a respected expert in the field, who was responsible for drawing up the UN guiding principles on business and human rights during 14 years in senior roles at the organisation, said that Fifas human rights responsibilities went beyond those issues related to tournaments.
Among others, he mentioned the risks to workers rights in Fifas own supply chain, alleged trafficking of young players and endemic discrimination against women in world football. He also called for Fifa to invest more resource in tackling the issue.
The HQ of Fifa is a surprisingly small entity. The new president has to pump more money into Fifa staff in Zurich, if only to get more eyes and hands monitoring information with regard to their supply chain and so on and so forth. At present, they lack the capacity to do what is required. You cant just hire a human rights manager and think youre done.
Fifa recently advertised for a new human rights manager and its head of sustainability, Federico Addiechi, insisted it was now taking the subject seriously. As the governing body of the most popular sport in the world, we have a responsibility in regard to human rights and in terms of how we go about developing the game of football and organising our competitions, he said. Beyond that, Fifa is committed to using its leverage to ensure respect for human rights.
Ruggie added: Fifa is not solely responsible for solving these problems where the actions of others are the primary cause. But it must use its influence to address these human rights risks as determinedly as it does to pursue its commercial interests.
The new Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said Fifa was fully committed to respecting human rights and said the new report would guide the way forward. This is an ongoing process and of course challenges remain but Fifa is committed to playing its part in ensuring respect for human rights and to being a leader among international sports organisations in this important area, he said.
Ruggies report was welcomed by Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation and a trenchant critic of the lack of progress by Qatar on the migrant workers issue. This report makes clear that Fifa must act decisively. Equally Qatar, which fails massively to meet the standards set out in the report, must ahead of the UN human rights and business forum which it is hosting next week, make a real commitment to comprehensive reform, she said.
The system of modern slavery for migrant workers, the absolute denial of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights, the poverty wages and the deep discrimination encountered by those who are delivering the huge 2022 infrastructure programme is completely out of step with the requirements that Professor Ruggie has highlighted, added Burrow.
This report represents a major challenge for Fifa and it also gives an opportunity for Qatar to comprehensively reform its medieval labour laws and thus retain the hosting rights to the 2022 World Cup, she said.
Amnesty International UK called on Infantino to take immediate steps to improve conditions for migrant workers in Qatar. Only concerted Fifa action to prevent abuses on World Cup sites will save the soul of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, it said."

World Cup stadiums, says Amnesty","Despite five years of growing criticism, Fifa and the Qatari authorities have been accused of ongoing indifference towards systemic abuse and appalling treatment of migrant workers working on stadiums that will host the 2022 World Cup.
A damning new report by Amnesty International, which interviewed 132 contractors working on refurbishing the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha and a further 102 landscapers who work in the Aspire Zone sports complex that surrounds it, claimed that they all reported human rights abuses of one kind or another.
The findings will prove controversial because Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy has made ensuring minimum standards are met on World Cup stadium projects a priority in the wake of widespread criticism of the broader conditions in which migrant labourers, who make up more than 90% of Qatars 2.1m population, live and work.
For the first time, Amnesty said it had definitively identified mistreatment and abuses on a World Cup stadium site rather than on infrastructure projects that underpin Qatars ambitious 2030 Vision, of which the football tournament has become an integral part.
It said that workers refurbishing the Khalifa stadium, scheduled to host one of the World Cup semi-finals in 2022, reported they were forced to live in squalid accommodation, appeared to pay huge recruitment fees, and have had wages withheld and passports confiscated. Amnesty conducted the interviews during three visits over the course of a year from February 2015.
Qatari law prohibits retention of passports, delayed payment of wages or deceptive recruitment (where workers are promised a certain wage in their country of origin only to be paid less when they arrive). But Amnesty found evidence that all of those practices remained widespread during the period in question.
The number of labourers working directly on World Cup stadiums increased from 2,000 to 4,000 in the past year and is expected to grow to 36,000 in the next two years.
The Amnesty report alleges that while the organising committee has introduced welfare standards there are significant gaps in application and its efforts have been undermined by indifference from Fifa and apathy from the Qatari authorities.
The stadium is part of the lavish Aspire Zone sports complex where Bayern Munich, Everton and Paris Saint-Germain trained this winter. The Welsh rugby team trained there before last years World Cup.
Of the men interviewed, Amnestys report found that the vast majority alleged they had their passports confiscated, 88 had been denied the right to leave Qatar, many reported their wages being paid three or four months in arrears and there was evidence that some workers on the stadium contracted to a labour-supply company appear to have been subjected to forced labour.
It said that there was evidence of workers being threatened with non-payment of wages, being deported or  conversely  not being allowed to leave Qatar because their employer would not provide an exit permit.
It claimed all the men interviewed had taken out loans to pay for recruitment-related fees, often to agencies in their home country. The practice is forbidden by Qatari law but remains widespread.
One metalworker on the stadium told Amnesty in April 2015: My life here is like a prison. The work is difficult, we worked for many hours in the hot sun. When I first complained about my situation, soon after arriving in Qatar, the manager said, If you want to complain you can, but there will be consequences. If you want to stay in Qatar, be quiet and keep working. Now I am forced to stay in Qatar and continue working.
Amnesty concluded that the human rights abuses it documented were the result of multiple failures and that while there had been a belated focus on the quality of workers accommodation by some of the companies involved, they have done little to address other well-documented issues such as deception in the recruitment process.
The abuse of migrant workers is a stain on the conscience of world football. For players and fans, a World Cup stadium is a place of dreams. For some of the workers who spoke to us, it can feel like a living nightmare, said Amnesty Internationals director general, Salil Shetty.
Indebted, living in squalid camps in the desert, paid a pittance, the lot of migrant workers contrasts sharply to that of the top-flight footballers who will play in the stadium. All workers want are their rights: to be paid on time, leave the country if need be and be treated with dignity and respect.
The report is particularly critical of Fifas failure to exert pressure on the Qatari authorities and a lack of meaningful action to address the issue.
The crisis-hit world football governing body has only now promised to formalise its human rights due diligence process, vowed to change its World Cup bidding rules and has commissioned Harvards Professor John Ruggie to write a report on its human rights standards.
The Amnesty report concludes its actions and omissions offer little hope that Fifa plans to do all it can to ensure that the 2022 World Cup will leave a positive legacy and not a trail of human misery.
Shetty said: Despite five years of promises, Fifa has failed almost completely to stop the World Cup being built on human rights abuses.
In the wake of a series of damning reports by NGOs, including Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, and major investigations by media outlets including the Guardian, the Qatari government commissioned law firm DLA Piper to review the issue in 2013.
It promised to overhaul the kafala system that ties workers to their employers, reform the exit permit regime and introduce new laws that required payment to workers to be made electronically.
DLA Piper reported in May 2014 but almost two years on, the government has failed to enact its recommendations in full and has failed to properly audit how many migrant labourers are killed or injured at work.
In May last year, Amnesty accused the Qatari government of promising little, delivering less and has said the promised reforms to the kafala system do not go far enough.
In its new report, it concludes: The governments response raises serious questions about Qatars willingness to protect the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers living in the country. If abuse on a flagship World Cup project does not merit investigation and action, it is unlikely abuses that do not attract the international spotlight will be dealt with in an effective manner.
The main contractor on the Khalifa stadium is a joint venture between Six Construct, a subsidiary of Belgian company Besix, and Midmac, a Qatari construction company. Other companies are contracted to carry out specific tasks, including Malaysian company Eversendai.
In turn, it used at least two labour supply companies. They are effectively agencies that sponsor a number of migrant workers to come to Qatar and hire them out to other companies.
As the report points out, the worst examples of abuse are often found buried beneath layers of sub-contractors. The landscaping work on the Aspire Zone is being done by Nakheel Landscapes, a Qatari company. The work on the Aspire Zone is not an official World Cup project.
In its response to Amnesty, Fifa pointed out the achievements of the supreme committee in introducing minimum welfare standards, the commitment by the new Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to integrate labour rights specifically into the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup and the formation of a 2022 Fifa World Cup sustainability working group.
While Fifa cannot and indeed does not have the responsibility to solve all the societal problems in a host country of a Fifa World Cup, Fifa has taken concrete action and is fully committed to do its utmost to ensure that human rights are respected on all Fifa World Cup sites and operations and services directly related to the Fifa World Cup, said Fifas head of sustainability, Federico Addiechi.
A Fifa spokesman added that dialogue over improvements to workers welfare was a ongoing process.
Challenges remain, but Fifa is confident that the structures and processes set up so far by the supreme committee for Delivery and Legacy, which is the entity responsible for the delivery of Fifa World Cup infrastructure, provide a good basis to monitor labour rights of migrant workers on Fifa World Cup stadium construction sites, he said.
These processes include the workers welfare standards in place since 2014, a compliance check for all tenderers, regular reporting that is publicly available and a four-tier system of auditing. This approach and these measures have been discussed with the key stakeholders, including Amnesty International.
The spokesman added: Furthermore, Fifa will continue to urge the competent governmental authorities in Qatar and other stakeholders to also take action and ensure that such standards become the benchmark for construction projects in Qatar.
In a response to Amnesty, Midmac said: We admire the work Amnesty International does and are fully committed to ensuring our entire workforce is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
It said that where a sub-contractor was not willing to correct deficiencies it would immediately stop any collaboration with them. It said terminating a sub-contract agreement is the strongest message we can send to those who are found to be non-compliant.
Six Construct said it had terminated the contracts of some sub-contractors as a result of Amnestys investigation, while Eversendai said it had stopped dealing with the two labour supply companies, had no intention of working with them in future, and would engage direct labour wherever possible. It said it was now in full compliance with welfare standards.
Nakheel said it was committed to making improvements to its employee conditions but in the absence of Amnesty sharing relevant information we wholly deny abuse of any of our workers on the Aspire maintenance project.
The Aspire Zone Foundation said it would be working hand in hand with the supreme committee to launch a number of positive initiatives across all World Cup related projects.
Qatars 2022 supreme committee said it had called for an immediate and comprehensive review of the application and enforcement of its workers welfare standards among all contractors, sub-contractors and labour supply companies.
In a statement it said that it is committed to ensuring the health, safety and well-being of every worker on World Cup projects, that the tone of Amnesty Internationals latest assertions paint[s] a misleading picture and the conditions reported were not representative of the entire work force on Khalifa.
The supreme committee argued that Amnesty focused on just four of the 40 companies that work on the stadium and that many of the problems identified by the NGO had already been rectified by the time it approached it with the findings some months later.
Last week, Qatar was given 12 months to end migrant worker slavery or face a possible United Nations investigation that could see it become the fifth country to face a formal inquiry by the International Labour Organisation.
The move followed an ILO delegation to the Gulf state this month that also found migrant workers stranded for months without pay and stripped of their passports."

Since Qatar controversially won the right to host the World Cup in December 2010, criticism has been mounting over the treatment of the growing army of labourers building the infrastructure required.
Following investigations by the Guardian and international human rights groups and amid a growing international outcry, the Gulf state announced a series of reforms in October 2015.
But in its World Report 2016, Human Rights Watch said the proposed changes to labour law failed to go far enough. Amnesty has been similarly critical.
Although Qatar has promised to reform the kafala system that binds workers to their employees, the proposed laws fail to address the most problematic issues.
Qatars inadequate labour law reforms undermined its progressive ambitions, said Sarah Leah Whitson, middle east director at Human Rights Watch.
The Qatari government should understand that protecting the rights of migrant construction workers is a necessary part of hosting a 21st century football tournament.
Under the new rules, workers must still obtain a no objection certificate from their employer if they want to move jobs and must still obtain an exit permit if they want to leave the country.
A series of investigations have found migrant workers, who make up more than 80% of Qatars population, living in squalid conditions with many toiling for low wages to pay back loans from unscrupulous recruitment agencies in their country of origin.
Workers building the new stadiums required for the tournament are covered by a charter that guarantees their rights but human rights organisations remain concerned about those working on the huge construction boom underpinning Qatars 2030 Vision, of which the World Cup is an integral part.
Despite a series of recommendations made by the international law firm DLA Piper in a report commissioned by the Qatari government in the wake of the Guardians reports, one of which was to produce definitive statistics on the number of migrants who are killed and injured at work, there has not been any significant progress."

Since Qatar won the right to host the World Cup, beating the USA in the final round of voting in December 2010, the decision has proved endlessly controversial.
Alongside bribery allegations over how the bid was won, denied by Qatar 2022, and concerns over the searing summer heat in the tiny Gulf state that led to the tournament being moved to December, there has been long standing concern over the treatment of migrant workers building the infrastructure to host the World Cup.
Pressure on Qatar escalated after the Guardian revealed death toll figures among migrant workers, forcing the government to commission a report from the international law firm DLA Piper. But 18 months after that report was published, many of its recommendations have yet to be enacted and, crucially, nothing has been done to assess the number of deaths and injuries or the reasons for them.
Too little has been done to address rampant migrant labour abuse. Qatars persistent labour reform delays are a recipe for human-rights disaster, said Mustafa Qadri, Gulf migrant rights researcher at Amnesty International.
The reforms proposed by the government fail to tackle the central issues that leave so many workers at the mercy of employers, yet even these changes have been delayed.
The reforms included changes to the exit visa system and to the kafala laws that tie workers to their employer. The Qatar 2022 supreme committee introduced a workers charter for those specifically building its stadiums and vast labour cities are being built to house migrant workers in better conditions, though not at a rate to cater for a population that is expected to reach 2m within two years.
In the eyes of human rights organisations the changes do not go nearly far enough and even then are not being introduced quickly enough. Unless action is taken  and soon  then every football fan who visits Qatar in 2022 should ask themselves how they can be sure they are not benefiting from the blood, sweat and tears of migrant workers, said Qadri.
Fifa has played its part in this sorry performance. It knew there were labour rights issues in Qatar. It must work closely with the Qatari authorities and business partners to ensure the World Cup is not built on exploitation.
In response, Qatar said Amnestys report did not accurately reflect the progress we have made and accused them of failing to provide comparative data on labour conditions in other countries employing large numbers of guest workers. We feel that the accusation that Qatar has failed to improve the human rights of its guest workers is simply untrue, read a statement. Significant reforms have been made and more are in the pipeline.
Amnesty, which along with Human Rights Watch and the International Trade Union Confederation, played a key role in bringing the issue to wider attention, issued a report in May that identified nine fundamental labour rights issues. It said Qatar had failed to seriously address five of them including paying wages on time, a delay in expanding the labour inspection force to 400 that had been promised by the end of this year and, perhaps most importantly, delay to even the limited changes proposed to the kafala law.
The changes were only introduced in October this year, will not be in force until the end of 2016 and even then workers will still require the consent of their employers to change jobs or leave the country.
Under the kafala system it is all too easy for an unscrupulous employer to get away with the late payment of salaries, housing workers in squalid and cramped accommodation, or threatening workers who complain about their conditions. That is why kafala requires a major overhaul, not just tinkering at the edges, said Qadri.
Following a public outcry and under growing pressure to act, Fifa said that it would hold Qatar to promises to improve conditions for migrant workers.In March, before the chaos that engulfed world football, the now suspended Fifa president Sepp Blatter said following a trip to Doha that Qatar was making progress on the issue. It is encouraging to hear the Emirs personal commitment to workers welfare and to get a sense of the improvements planned for all workers in Qatar, he said. It is clear that Qatar takes its responsibility as host seriously and sees the Fifa World Cup as a catalyst for positive social change.
However, human rights organisations doubt whether Fifa is serious about forcing fundamental changes that will result in significant improvements to the conditions for all migrant workers working on the huge construction boom underpinning the growth of Qatar and the infrastructure that will host the World Cup. Fifa has bent over backwards to make a Qatar World Cup work, even taking the unprecedented step of moving the tournament from summer to winter. But apart from occasional public statements the organisation has not set any clear, concrete agenda for how it will push Qatar to ensure migrant workers rights are respected, said Qadri.
Fifa may be moving to new leadership in 2016, but it will not be able to get past its current challenges until it makes it clear that Qatars hosting of the World Cup is contingent on respect for human rights."

football stadium, coach Felix Sanchez barks instructions at his Qatar under-23 team. Out of here! he screams as his players run the ball into a channel filled with Palestinian defenders. Yalla shabab! he shouts in Arabic. Lets go, lads! He shakes his head, fuming, as football coaches do.
It is late September and an early-round tie of the West Asian Cup, in front of no more than 200 spectators and against a poor opposition, in more ways than one. Three of Palestines players, from Gaza, have hardly played with their West Bank-based team-mates, because it is so difficult for them to travel through Israel. They are a tough-tackling bunch. Sanchezs players, by contrast, are hothouse flowers: the carefully groomed sons of the small Qatari middle class, who lack for nothing when it comes to coaching, facilities and preparation.
Marshalling the Qatar defence is the captain, Musaab Khidir, a charismatic 22-year-old with braces on his teeth and light-footed poise. In midfield is Ahmad Moein, the 19-year-old fulcrum of the team, a player who models his passing game on videos of former England star Frank Lampard. In an otherwise empty stand, three Palestinian fans resolutely wave their national flag as their players wilt in the 30C evening heat and Qatar ease to a 3-0 win.
Even against mediocre opposition, you can understand Sanchezs urgency. The former youth coach at Barcelona FCs La Masia academy, which has turned out superstars such as Lionel Messi, is now in charge of a squad expected to form the core of the side to play in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, perhaps the most controversial global sporting event since the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
Back in 2010, when Fifas now-suspended president Sepp Blatter shocked the world by announcing Qatar as hosts, the country qualified for its own tournament automatically. Unless it upsets the form book by qualifying for the next tournament, in Russia in 2018, it will become the first host nation in history never to have been good enough to reach the World Cup finals under its own steam. This all comes against a background of bribery scandals, and international outrage over the countrys treatment of migrant labourers.
This is the inside story of Qatars extraordinary football experiment, as it tries to find out if it is possible to buy its way from a world ranking of 112 (when it was awarded the hosting rights) to world-class status by the time the tournament comes round in November 2022. Succeed, and Qatar could boost its soft power on the global stage and spark a football boom in the Middle East. Fail, and the nations rulers face embarrassment in front of a television audience of more than a billion. Sanchez and his young players have a lot resting on their shoulders.
Qatars huge gas and oil reserves have, in the space of just four decades, taken it from a Persian Gulf backwater known for pearl diving and fishing to the richest country on Earth per capita. The nations ruling family, the Al Thani clan, has decided to pour cash into football in the hope that it will prove a passport to international credibility, as well as building a new sense of national identity and purpose. The best players, coaches, sports administrators and stadium architects are being flown in from around the world.
To many, it makes no sense. It is far too hot to play football for most of the year, when temperatures can hit extremes of 50C. When it comes to assembling a team, the nation of no more than 400,000 Qataris has very little talent to choose from. There are fewer than 7,000 registered players, compared with three million in Spain and six million in Germany; the Solomon Islands have more players than Qatar. Zico, the Brazilian who played in three World Cups, has called for Qatar to be stripped of the tournament, because they dont have football.
From the outset, the project has been buffeted by major scandals; however successful the countrys preparations, it may always be seen as the cup that shouldnt have been. In 2013, the Guardian reported that 44 Nepalese labourers had died at work on building sites in Qatar in the space of just two months. The following year, it was revealed that workers on a World Cup stadium designed by Zaha Hadid were earning 45p an hour.
Around the same time came allegations of multimillion-dollar bribery in the bidding process, involving the Qatari Fifa vice-president Mohamed Bin Hammam. Leaked documents suggested he paid $5m (£3m) in cash, gifts and legal fees to senior football officials. Qatars 2022 organising committee argued that Hammam had nothing to do with their bid  that he had been building support for his own tilt at the Fifa presidency.
After an internal investigation of the combined bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, Fifa agreed in November last year that Hammam had no formal role within the Qatar 2022 bid team, and that his actions had not compromised the process. Yet questions remain. Michael Garcia, the US lawyer who conducted the investigation for Fifas ethics committee, has since resigned, complaining that the limited summary of his report published by Fifa contained numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions. In June, Swiss investigators said they were looking into 53 possible cases of money laundering, and 121 incidents of suspicious activity in Swiss bank accounts. The head of Fifas audit and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, has said there could be a re-vote if clear evidence of bribery emerges. Until then, Qatars grand project rolls on.
Drive around Doha (hardly anyone walks  it is far too hot) and you can spot the outline of an emerging football culture. New UFO-shaped football stadiums are sandwiched between dusty shopping malls and gated villa communities: some are for local club sides, and are far too big for their meagre fanbases; others, like the Norman Foster-designed 86,250-seat Lusail stadium, are for the World Cup final.
Qatar is pouring money into the World Cup project almost as fast as it bubbles from its oil and gas fields: a staggering $200bn will go into infrastructure, including a new rail network, hotels and roads ahead of the tournament, dwarfing the £9.3bn the UK spent on the 2012 London Olympics.
There are hints of fandom, too. In the malls, with their Swarowski crystal shops and smartphone concessions, Qatari teens sport Barcelona and Paris St-Germain shirts; Qatar sponsors the former and owns the latter. Turn on the TV and football gushes forth. Qatar has splashed out on the rights to televise 52 football competitions worldwide, and state broadcaster BeIN sports now has 18 football channels. BeIN has hired the former Sky Sports presenters Richard Keys and Andy Gray, who resigned and were sacked, respectively, after making sexist remarks. (Keys doesnt seem entirely reformed; in an online clip filmed in his Doha TV studio, he introduces a female crew member as naughty Nora.)
But look closer, and other parts of Qatars new football culture are a desert mirage. Sanchezs team perform in front of almost empty stands; so few people want to watch club matches that low-paid migrant workers from Africa and Asia are bussed in, in their thousands, to fill empty seats. When I arrived at a match in the Qatar Stars League, the top-flight competition, the first thing I saw was a Kenyan pulling on a traditional white gown. He and his friends said they were among hundreds paid the equivalent of £5 to dress up as Qataris, fill a seat and have a stab at singing football songs in Arabic. When asked, the league said it doesnt pay for fake fans and doesnt condone the practice; clubs do, however, pay entertainers to create an atmosphere.
This is another irony: the vast majority of Qatars population is excluded from the footballing side of the World Cup project. More than 1.8m residents (about 80% of the population) are migrant workers, mostly labourers from south Asia and Africa, earning salaries of around £10 a day while living in basic, sometimes squalid, labour camps on the city fringes. These people, many of whom love football and play when they get the chance, cannot become citizens. Rather than being the peoples game, football in Qatar is the game of the minority elite.
The engine room of the 2022 project is the Aspire Academy, a kind of sporting Hogwarts on the fringes of Doha, founded by the Emir in 2004. This is where 240 Qatari children live, learn and train to become top footballers, swimmers and athletes, their fees paid for by the state.
Beneath a blue dome on a full-sized, air-conditioned pitch, training is overseen by experienced coaches from the Spanish, German and English leagues; outside, children play on half a dozen international-standard, extravagantly irrigated outdoor fields. Pele and Maradona are among ex-players to have been flown in to help; the goalkeepers have received coaching from the Spanish and German internationals Iker Casillas and Manuel Neuer. Almost everyone in the current under-23 squad attended Aspire, which means that Qatars World Cup side will essentially be an old boys team.
Aspires director is Ivan Bravo, an urbane Spaniard who until 2010 was director of strategy at Real Madrid. Sitting on a sofa outside his large office, the US MBA-educated executive explains what Qatar hopes to achieve. It is the same as Spain ahead of the 1992 Olympics, he says. It was developing economically, coming of age and trying to build a presence in the international arena. What gave Spaniards self-confidence, credibility, respect and a seat at the table with the rest of the world was sport: first the Barcelona Olympics, then Real Madrid and Barcelona becoming the biggest clubs in the world, then the national team winning the World Cup Then Rafa Nadal, Fernando Alonso and the NBA [basketball] players: that gave Spain self-esteem.
As for Spain, so for Qatar  or thats the theory: that sport can unlock international status and domestic self-confidence. But because Qatar has so few citizens, it cannot rely on what Bravo describes as Darwinian selection, where only the hungriest and most competitive reach the top. Qatar runs an ambitious foreign scouting programme, Aspire Football Dreams, which screens around 500,000 children a year from west Africa, central America and south-east Asia. The best few are offered the chance to train at the academy in Doha, and at another in Senegal.
This has raised suspicions that the country will naturalise the best players to strengthen its squad. But Bravo says that giving passports to foreign players has been all but ruled out. He points out that Fifa rules mean a player must have lived in a country continuously for five years after the age of 18 before representing the national side. They still have seven years until kickoff, but Bravo insists, What we are trying to do is have the players born in Qatar, whose parents are born in Qatar and meet the eligibility rules, to be the ones who represent Qatar. There are no Africans coming in.
Instead, they hothouse Qatari boys. Aspire Academy scouts scour every primary school in Qatar for talented children as young as six, inputting every childs level of skill into a database. Around the age of 11, they select 400 children for pre-Academy teams, offering 25 scholarships a year. These children are on site for 10 hours a day, to fit in two training sessions, plus lessons including English, Islamic studies, Spanish, French, maths. The older ones stay overnight in what feels more like a business hotel than a boarding school. The walls bear the school motto, Aspire today. Inspire tomorrow. When the boys graduate, they wear special blue capes emblazoned with silver-and-gold angel wings.
The current under-23-team goalkeeper, Muhannad Hussein, 22, who at 6ft 1in is one of the few Qataris tall enough to play in his position, is an Aspire graduate. Focused and polite, he says he was eight when he first kicked a ball in the school playground not far from his home in Duhail, an affluent north Doha suburb, where he lived with his mum and his dad, an IBM computer engineer. Within a couple of years, his teacher spotted his talent and suggested he join a club. It was 1999, and football meant little in Qatar, which was becoming rich with the gas boom but was still socially conservative.
[My parents] sometimes refused to allow me to go to training, he says. They thought it was a game, that it cannot be work or a source of life for me in the future. They wanted me to find normal work: businessman, engineer, doctor, pilot. It was really difficult. If you ask my father now if he could have seen the future, he would have given me to football without a fight. Having the World Cup in Qatar has changed peoples minds.
Muhannad is desperate to play at the World Cup. I must be there. I dont care about any failure in the way. The big thing is 2022.
Mr Alaaeldin, an Egyptian civil engineer who brought his family to Qatar in 2003, is another parent persuaded of footballs value as a career. His sons Ahmed and Mohamed both trained at Aspire and are now in Sanchezs squad. He says that attitudes to football have changed dramatically. A football player is better than a civil engineer now. The status has changed. They give the footballers everything.
Decent adolescent players spotted by local clubs are given signing-on fees and even weekly cash sums just for showing up for training, a practice Bravo fears takes away the hunger that makes great players. I was told some 21-year-old Qatari players can earn as much as $300,000 a year, with wages rising to $800,000. Maintaining players commitment and drive is hard when the usual threat of bringing in the next best player doesnt apply: there are no next best players here.
The culture conspires against players commitment, one coach working in the national setup tells me. The desire to keep going, to come to training, the commitment of the players is not the same. At home, they have everything. They click their fingers and there it is.
And there are signs of worry creeping in. After Nepal managed to qualify for next years under-16 Asian championships, and Qatar failed, local sports newspaper Doha Stadium Plus warned: Something is not right in the way [the teams] are being groomed. A senior Aspire coach was quoted as saying, Football isnt just about facilities, its also about luck and hunger to do well. Tellingly, the team that eventually knock Sanchezs under-23s out of this autumns West Asian Cup, winning 2-0 in the semi-final, are from war-torn Syria.
Mottram Hall hotel in rural Cheshire is the kind of place footballers go when theyve already made it. Sir Alex Ferguson is honorary captain of the golf club; the spa is popular with the wives of players at the local Premier League clubs. In early September, it is also base for a training camp for Sanchezs team. The 2022 hopefuls arrive having just spent a few weeks training in Switzerland, to escape the heat of the Qatari summer, and have made themselves at home. Some take an afternoon nap while Arab pop music drifts out across the golf course from other players bedroom windows. After training, a couple of the players sit down and reveal the flipside of their money-no-object world: huge pressure.
People say the Qatari players have everything and are not showing it, says Ahmed Moein, 19, a midfielder the coaches have tipped as one of the teams most promising talents. It puts more pressure on. My friends want us to qualify not just for the second round [of the World Cup] but maybe more  because it is in Qatar, and because everything is helping us, and there are no excuses.
Moein is the son of a Doha construction manager and has sacrificed a rich family life to play his part in Qatars football dream. He comes from the fishing settlement of Al Wakrah, just south of Doha, and is the eldest of five children. He started playing at eight and joined his local club, but since the age of 17 he has been playing at KAS Eupen. Aspire bought this Belgian second division club, near the border with Germany, wholesale  as a place to harden up some of its 2022 talents against the older and stronger players in the league. There are currently six young Qatari hopefuls in KAS Eupens squad. (Qatar is in the process of snapping up another lower-league European club, Cultural y Deportivo Leonesa in Spain, for the same purpose.) But the conservative, German-speaking Eupen (population 18,949) is a very foreign location for a boy bought up in the Arabian desert, however dedicated and ambitious. It is very cold and boring, Moein admits. He is homesick. His family sometimes send him dates to remind him of home. It is the hardest thing, he says. I have spent all my life with my parents and family, so its hard not to have them beside me. Now its the third year, I am getting used to it.
Moein, in common with nearly everyone playing or working in Qatari football, doesnt want to talk about the bribery and slavery allegations. These things are for the media, he says. We are the players. We dont care. We just do our job.
The team captain, Musaab Khidir, cuts a striking figure on and off the pitch. He sports a wedge haircut like the England star Raheem Sterling, wears tight black leggings and sleeves that he pulls over his hands as he talks, offset with a bright pink rucksack. He says he is desperate to make something of his situation: if he is not a success, then he might as well have studied. He talks about sacrifice. In Doha, after the sun goes down, the young head to shopping malls, where they meet in cafes and cinemas. All this is off limits. His fathers advice has been blunt: Eat well, sleep well, forget girls and going out with your friends.
I finish training, have dinner and go home, Khidir says. I try and stay away from my friends. This is a big chance for me. I can hardly believe that I could even play two or three minutes in the World Cup. I wouldnt be able to sleep. We will be ready, inshallah.
Four weeks later, Sanchez and his squad are back in Qatar, and they have just got their hands on a secret weapon. Already, they have a lavish backroom support staff that would make their rivals jealous, including a nutritionist, a masseur, a doctor, a recovery specialist, two physiotherapists, two kit men, a video tactician and three coaches. But on a sticky evening, as they train in the shadow of cranes erecting the 40,000-seat Khalifa International stadium for the 2022 tournament, they are joined by a major new asset.
On the edge of the penalty box, offering tips on free-kick technique, is Xavi Hernández, one of the best midfielders ever to have played the game. Five months earlier, Xavi had lifted the European Cup in Berlins Olympic Stadium, as captain of Barcelona. It was the fourth time he had lifted the trophy, the final act of a staggeringly successful career that also saw him win the World Cup and European Championship (twice) with Spain. With his Barcelona and Spain midfield colleague Andrés Iniesta, he became the master of the quick passing, possession style of football known as tiki taka, transforming the game around the world.
Now he has promised to coach Qatar all the way to 2022, as well as play for a club side, on a reported £7m-a-year contract. The young players can barely believe he is here, posing for selfies with him after training and picking his brains on technique as they walk to the dressing rooms.
The following day, Xavi sits down in the lobby of Dohas five-star Millennium hotel to reflect on his first two months in Qatar. He arrives alone, and is engaged and relaxed, enjoying, he says, the absence of pressure after a 25-year career at Barcelona. His wife, Núria Cunillera, is expecting their first child, a girl, in December, and his two brothers, sister and brother-in-law have all joined him. They are living in the compound previously occupied by Raúl, the former Spain captain who played in Qatar until last year.
In the face of the controversies around the 2022 World Cup, Xavi is upbeat. The move to Qatar has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life, he says. He is even delighted by the attendance numbers at matches, and seems unaware that paid crowds are bussed in. This is the biggest project in world football. It is fantastic for the country, for the players, for a new generation and for me. I am not here for two years and then leaving Qatar. This is a very big project for me and my family.
But his reflections on what he has seen so far chime with Bravos concern about an absence of Darwinism in Qatari football. The level is better than we expected. They have talent here, but they need to continue playing for the whole game. For example, they play for 20, 30 minutes fantastic, and then switch off a little bit. They need to be more competitive. The people of Qatar need a more competitive mentality. Now, with the World Cup 2022, they are changing a little bit.
Does he think Qatar can avoid being knocked out in the first round group stage? Maybe, probably. For example, Spain in the last World Cup had a very bad group stage [and were knocked out in it]. They want to be competitive, but after that we dont know. Maybe they win one game. We dont know. They want to improve. They have time.
Xavi sees his job as that of bringing tiki taka to Qatar. Pap. Pap, pap, pap, he says, making the sound of a ball being passed quickly. I want them not only to play for playings sake, but to understand the game.
That evening, as the sun goes down, Xavi arrives at the Al-Ahli stadium to captain his club team, Al Sadd, in a Qatar Stars League match. In the car park, 20 minutes before kick-off, I spot a group of African men pulling on white gowns normally worn by Qatari nationals. They point to a queue of other men, already dressed in robes, who they say have been bussed to the ground after finishing their shifts on building sites or as security guards; they will earn an extra 30 riyals (£5.40) by posing as football fans.
They are looking for bodies because there is no one to come, says Michael, a Kenyan security guard, who has invested in a robe to earn weekly fees as a fake fan. The Qataris are not interested. Most are busy and they prefer to watch at home. We earn a minimum amount  if you get 30 extra riyals, you can feed yourself better.
They think that with the World Cup, people will worry that theres nobody here to watch the matches, says Kumar, an Indian builder who also says he is being paid 30 riyals to attend. Thats why they do this.
Around the corner, a thousand or so south Asian builders, many from one contractor, are escorted into another swath of seats behind a goal. They dont have gowns and are not paid, but they have been given free tickets by the club. Asked about what looks like a lack of genuine fans, the league told me: Our goal is not to fill a stadium with people who dont want to be there. Our goal is to create a professional league with passionate fans, and in turn increase our attendance with people who really love football. Ironically, in a survey carried out last year by the government, many Qataris cited paid fans as a factor that made them reluctant to attend games.
One of the biggest questions facing Qatar  and international football  over the next seven years is whether the game can ever transcend the idea that cash is king. Qataris have the money; now they have to discover some soul in their professed passion for the game. With the demographics stacked against finding many real stars, and a climate and culture that doesnt encourage participation or attendance, that looks tough. If they fail, the fear is that the high point of the sporting lives of players such as Muhannad, Ahmed and Musaab will also be a nadir in international footballs reputation, as a sport overtaken by money and power games.
As kick-off at the Al-Ahli stadium approaches, a rust-coloured moon rises in the sky and a few rich Qataris in immaculate robes settle into their air-conditioned executive boxes. In the bleachers, busloads of uniformed primary school children wave home team flags handed out by the club, and the rented fans file in. By the halfway line, a group of Al Sadd fans with pipes, drums and megaphone maintain steady chants. A steward tells me some of them have been paid up to 100 riyals each to create some atmosphere. They are doing a good job.
Four minutes into the match, Al Sadd piece together a sweeping move for Xavi to score with his right foot from close to the penalty spot. He smiles broadly as he wheels away in celebration and several thousand fans salute him  many fake, some of them real. It is a fitting image: Qatar has paid for everything, from the superstar scoring the goal to the fans cheering him on.
I ask Stanley, one of the Kenyans paid to be here, if he has enjoyed the game. Hes not interested in football, he says, with a shrug. Were only here for the money."

Xavi, 35, is a World Cup winner and former Barcelona captain. At an evening match between his side Al Sadd and rivals Al Ahli last month, groups of fans told the Guardian they had been paid about £5 to attend or had been given free tickets.
They included several African security guards, who wore white robes they said helped them look more like Qataris. Indian construction workers said they had been paid chant football songs in Arabic they had been taught but did not understand.
An entire end  about 1,000 spectators  comprised builders from south Asia. Musicians with drums and pipes had been hired to create atmosphere.
We are here for the money, said Kumar, an Indian builder who had been bussed in from a labour camp. They pay 30 riyals (£5) per match. They teach us the clapping actions and some songs. They think with the World Cup people will worry that there will be nobody to watch the matches so that is why they do this.
Michael, a security guard from Kenya, said: They are looking for bodies because there is no one to come. The Qataris are not interested. Most are busy and they prefer to watch at home. We earn a minimum amount [in our day jobs] so if you get 30 extra riyals you can feed yourself better.
A spokesperson for the Qatar Stars League (QSL), which organises the matches, said it did not pay agents or fans to attend games. It confirmed that clubs sometimes gave tickets to businesses to increase club awareness, and that tickets at the Al Ahli v Al Sadd match had been given for free to workers from a construction company that had recently renovated the stadium. It said clubs hired entertainers in the crowds to create an atmosphere during matches.
Our goal is not to fill a stadium with people who dont want to be there, the spokesperson said. Our goal is to create a professional league, with passionate fans, and in turn increase our attendance with people who really love football.
QSL said attendance this season was up 40% on the one before. Al Ahli did not respond to requests for comment.
Qatars successful bid document for the 2022 tournament claimed the region was brimming with sporting passion. The Gulf state is paying Xavi a reported £7m a year to play in the Qatar Stars league and to coach the countrys young players.
The World Cup preparations have been hit by allegations of bribery in the bidding process, strongly denied by Qatar, and outrage from human rights groups over the countrys treatment of migrant construction workers.
Last year, the Qatari government published survey results that showed paid fans were turning people off attending matches.
The migrant workers said their attendance at games was organised by middlemen who arranged bus transport from their dormitory camps and payments, which were normally made a day or two after the match.
I take 70 or 80 [workers] for a match and bring them by bus from the camps, said a Sudanese agent. I bring security guards and pay them 30 riyals. He said he received about 60 riyals per fan. Its a good business, he said. I earn more than in my day job.

Now Zaha Hadid has completed her rockstar credentials by storming out of an interview on Radio 4s flagship Today programme. Lets stop this conversation right now, she barked this morning, after Sarah Montague pressed her on the reasons why projected costs for the Tokyo Olympic stadium project spiralled out of control. I dont want to carry on.
It was the final straw, after Montague had raised the condition of migrant workers in Qatar, where Hadid is building the 2022 World Cup stadium, mistakenly repeating the allegation that there have been 1,200 workers deaths on the project  a report that was withdrawn after Hadid filed a lawsuit against the New York Review of Books . The figure related to construction projects across Qatar, not Hadids project alone, which hadnt even broken ground at the time of publication.
You should check your information before you say anything, said Hadid, increasingly angry with the tone of questioning. I sued them and they had to withdraw and apologise.
Hadid didnt do herself any favours, letting forth a blustering barrage of indignation, but it was a sloppily researched interview, and yet another example of mainstream media focusing solely on her work for dubious regimes  something which most other architects of her international profile are also engaged in, but rarely questioned on.
Norman Foster has designed a gigantic pleasure dome and a Palace of Peace and Reconciliation in Kazakhstan, a regime that rules with an iron fist, cracking down on freedom of assembly, speech and religion, regularly locking up and torturing critical journalists and forcibly evicting residents to make way for grand construction projects. Yet the international press fawns over Fosters bold high-tech forms.
Rem Koolhaas is engaged in projects across the Middle East, including a vast library and foundation headquarters currently nearing completion in Qatar , yet the condition of his construction workers is never the focus of the story. His practice has built a gargantuan headquarters for Chinas state television company in Beijing   ironically named CCTV  which couldnt be more of a monument to censorship, yet it is universally celebrated as another stroke of genius from the Dutchman.
His temper is just as short as Hadids, yet she is typecast as the famously grumpy, demanding old diva, while hes the charismatic maverick. Richard Rogers can throw his toys out of the pram when things dont go his way, but all the media sees is a kindly veteran with natty neon dress sense.
It is striking that even RIBAs gold medal citation mentions Hadids fiery temperament. She herself is the opposite of modest, writes her former tutor, Peter Cook. Indeed her vociferous criticism of poor work or stupidity recalls the line-side comments of the tennis player John McEnroe.
Such focus on her character, rather than the work, could be dismissed as casual sexism  were it not for the fact that Hadid plays up to her tyrannical stereotype to the extent that she has almost become a caricature of her media persona. In public lectures she regularly loses her temper on stage, berating fumbling technicians and calling out members of the audience for not paying attention. In interviews, she will happily just ignore questions she doesnt want to answer, rolling her eyes at the journalists idiocy and temerity, or simply walking out, as she did this morning, albeit to a bigger audience than usual.
As veteran architecture critic Paul Goldberger tweeted, when Hadid filed her lawsuit against the New York Review of Books: Zaha proves Goldbergers law: the greater the success, the thinner the skin.
Its just useful to remember occasionally that shes not the only one."

The posting, published on 27 May, was accompanied by a misleading infographic. After initial complaints, the article was updated to reflect the fact that the figures included total migrant worker deaths in Qatar
In fact, according to a statement issued by the Qatari governments communication office in Doha, there had not been a single death on a World Cup site.
Now it appears that the blog has been amended yet again. In effect, WashPo appears to have withdrawn the story. The misleading comparative graphic has been removed and a lengthy clarification, which was posted on 23 June, states:
An earlier version of this post, and accompanying graphic, created the impression that more than 1,000 migrant workers in Qatar had died working on 2022 World Cup infrastructure.
The post should have made clearer that the figures involved all migrant deaths in Qatar. A report by Qatars government found 964 deaths of migrants from India, Nepal and Bangladesh in 2012 and 2013. Other groups have cited a higher number over a longer period of time.
A lengthy statement by Qatars government said not a single workers life has been lost in connection with the World Cup construction, while an account by The Guardian (see here) linked some deaths to the construction.
Ultimately, we are unable to verify how many deaths, if any, are related to World Cup construction. This post and the graphic have been revised to provide a more accurate picture of whats known and not known.
Unable to verify is wonderful weasel wording. And the new headline, which makes no sense anyway given the revision, could itself do with revision. It says: The toll of human casualities (sic) in Qatar."

Human rights campaigners criticised the move, the latest blow to efforts to end the kafala system that ties workers to their employers and prevents them from changing jobs or leaving the country without the permission of their sponsor. Many have gone months without pay or had their passports confiscated.
Even modest reforms promised by the Qatari government in the wake of a Guardian investigation and in-depth reports from rights organisations have become mired in holdups.
The official state news agency, QNA, said on Tuesday that the shura council, Dohas main consultative body, had postponed a vote on the reforms and referred them back to the internal and foreign affairs committee for further study.
The legislation is expected to regulate the entry and exit of foreign workers and their residency status in the country, and will be referred to the states leadership if approved by the council.
There are more than 1.6 million foreign workers in Qatar, a number that has risen due to a boom in infrastructure spurred by the emirates plans to host the World Cup in 2022. In May, Amnesty International accused Qatar of failing migrant workers and promising little and delivering less in terms of meaningful reform of its labour laws ahead of the World Cup.
An investigation by the Guardian last year revealed that Nepalese migrants building the infrastructure to host the World Cup have died at a rate of one every two days in 2014  despite Qatars promises to improve their working conditions.
Mustafa Qadri, Gulf migrants researcher with Amnesty International, said the councils action, if true, would represent a significant backward step in the long, slow and up until now, largely unsuccessful bid to improve migrant labour rights protections in Qatar.
I hope this report is a misrepresentation, otherwise it would suggest the shura is in denial about the scale of migrant labour abuse, he told the Guardian.
It would also fly totally in the face of commitments made by senior Qatari officials like the minister of labour in recent months promising to implement limited reforms aimed at making it easier for migrant workers to change jobs, leave the country, among other things."

The posting, published on 27 May, claimed that 1,200 people had died in Qatar since 2010 during the construction of the countrys World Cup facilities. And it forecast that 4,000 will die before the country stages the 2022 football competition.
But were the figures in its striking infographic correct? Since it was first published, the blog has been amended. In its latest manifestation, a line has been appended saying:
This story has been updated to reflect the fact that figures include total migrant worker deaths in Qatar, not just World Cup-related deaths.
That followed complaints from the Qatar government that the blog was wrong. The figures were estimates for the deaths of Qatars total immigrant population (numbering more than 1m) for whatever reasons: old age, diseases, strokes, heart attacks, suicides, road accidents and other accidents.
According to a statement issued by the Qatari governments communication office in Doha there has not been a single death on a World Cup construction site.
By the time that claim was publicised - here in the Sydney Morning Herald, for example - the WashPo blog had been widely accepted as fact.
It was viewed millions of times - as was a back-up tweet - and its details, prior to the addition of the appended statement, were repeated by hundreds of media outlets across the world.
Channel 4 News ran a story based on it, as did the Guardian and the Independent. The numbers were cited in parliament.
When football commentator Richard Keys argued that the blog figures were inaccurate, he was debunked in the Daily Express. (Keys presents football matches from Qatar for Al-Jazeera, the TV channel partly funded by the states ruling family).
A spokesman for the outraged Qatari government believes the country has suffered reputational damage because of the myth perpetrated by the blog.
A letter sent to the Washington Post by Saif Al Thani, of the Qatari government communications office - which has been seen by the Guardian - complains that a previous letter sent to the editor for publication had not been used.
It states: As a result of the Posts online article, readers around the world have now been led to believe that thousands of migrant workers in Qatar have perished, or will perish, building the facilities for World Cup 2022  a claim that has absolutely no basis in fact. He wants the Post to take down the article.
NB: Lest anyone think Im some kind of apologist for the Qatar government, I would remind you of this blogpost published on this blog on 27 May and in the London Evening Standard on 20 May.

Please read this sentence and try not to laugh after doing so: Any instance relating to an apparent restriction of press freedom is of concern to Fifa and will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves.
That was the response by international footballs governing body after a BBC crew was arrested in Qatar for daring to act like journalists.
This is the press freedom-loving Fifa that frustrated the Sunday Times during its award-winning investigation into the circumstances that led to the controversial decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
This is also the organisation that spent 18 months investigating, with the seriousness it deserves, widespread allegations of corruption involving the Qatari bid and declared itself squeaky clean after ignoring the bulk of its chief investigators detailed report.
So I think we can imagine the likely outcome of Fifas investigation into the arrest of the BBC team and, incidentally, the arrest and interrogation of German journalists the week before.
Clearly, Fifa and Qatar deserve each other. They share the dubious distinction of opposing the exercise of press freedom. Following the detention of the BBCs Middle East correspondent, Mark Lobel, along with his cameraman, driver and translator, the best excuse that Qatari officials could advance was the crew had been guilty of trespass.
In what other country would an instance of (alleged) trespass involve the deployment of eight cars, the frisking of a media team by a dozen members of the security forces, the confiscation of their equipment and hours of hostile questioning by intelligence officers.
As Lobel discovered from his interrogators, he had been under surveillance throughout his time in Qatar. They had actually photographed my every move since I arrived, he said.
His arrest was no accident. It was the culmination of an operation designed to prevent the BBC - and all journalists - from delving into the the plight of migrant workers who are building World Cup stadiums. Lobel was, to quote a BBC spokesman, engaged in a perfectly proper piece of journalism.
What joins Fifa and Qatar in unholy matrimony is the shared belief that journalists should know their place. For Fifa that means reporters sticking to covering football matches and no more. For Qatar, it involves restricting visiting reporters to sanctioned tours in which their activities are monitored.
Laughably, Qatars head of communications, Saif al-Thani, said: We deeply regret that he [Lobel] was unable to report the real story, which is that the government and the private sector are making significant progress in efforts to improve the lives and the labour conditions of guest workers in Qatar.
If that is the case, if Qatar has nothing to hide, then why was Lobel being covertly photographed? Why was it necessary to arrest him? Why was his crews equipment not returned to them?
No wonder Human Rights Watch described the arrests as jaw-droppingly awful PR and, doubtless, the London-based Portland Communications, which acts on behalf of the Qatari government, will be addressing that matter in discreet calls to journalists.
Meanwhile, dont hold your breath as you await Fifas investigation into these incidents. I imagine a forthcoming statement about there having been a misunderstanding.
How many more of those will occur as reporters from across the world take an interest in freedom-loving Qatar and its links with Fifa?"

The government in Kathmandu has also for the first time publicly criticised Fifa, world footballs governing body, and its commercial partners. It insists that they must put more pressure on Qatar to improve conditions for the 1.5 million migrants employed in the Gulf state as part of the World Cup construction boom.
About 400,000 of the workers on the project are from Nepal, with the rest mainly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Tek Bahadur Gurung, Nepals labour minister, said: After the earthquake of 25 April, we requested all companies in Qatar to give their Nepalese workers special leave and pay for their air fare home. While workers in some sectors of the economy have been given this, those on World Cup construction sites are not being allowed to leave because of the pressure to complete projects on time.
They have lost relatives and their homes and are enduring very difficult conditions in Qatar. This is adding to their suffering.
Gurung said Nepals government had been attempting, without success, to contact Fifa and its sponsors to ask them to be more robust with Qatar. Nothing will change for migrant workers until Fifa and its rich sponsors insist on it. These are the people who are bringing the World Cup to Qatar. But we are a small, poor country and these powerful organisations are not interested in listening to us.
South Asian countries have been reluctant to speak out about the controversy over migrant workers for fear of alienating Qatar.
Nepal has high unemployment and its government estimates that some $4bn is sent home every year by expatriates, most of them working in the Gulf. This accounts for about 20% of the countrys gross domestic product, and is money that will play a crucial role in helping to rebuild the country following the two recent earthquakes.
Gurung said: We want to work with the Qatari government and bodies like Fifa because our people need the jobs and Nepal needs the money more than ever. Things are very difficult for the Nepalese and other workers in Qatar, but we have to help them and cannot stay silent any longer.
Informal talks have taken place between the labour ministers of Nepal, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with a view to establishing a more coordinated approach to improving conditions for workers in Qatar.
Their plight has once again been in the headlines. Last week it was reported that a BBC crew had been arrested and detained for two days while filming a report on the conditions of south Asian workers in the Gulf state.
Amnesty International published a report on Thursday saying that Qatar had failed to deliver on a range of promises to improve conditions and introduce new legislation covering migrant workers. This included abolishing the kafala system  which ties workers to their employers for a set period, during which they cannot change jobs without permission.
Migrant workers also often have their passports confiscated, may go for several months without pay, and have limited insurance against accidents.
Without prompt action, the pledges Qatar made last year are at serious risk of being dismissed as a mere PR stunt to ensure the Gulf state can cling on to the 2022 World Cup, said the Amnesty report, which also raised the issue of Nepalese workers being denied leave to return home after the earthquake.
Qatars supreme committee for delivery and legacy, the body overseeing World Cup projects, said that more than 500 Nepalese workers on World Cup projects had been given leave to return temporarily.
Gurung said: There are far more than 500 Nepalese working on different World Cup construction sites, I can assure you. We have even offered to pay the air fare home for all our people building stadiums and involved in other projects, where companies are not willing, but not even this has made a difference. Our embassy in Doha has been inundated with requests for help from World Cup workers who are not allowed to leave.
The minister said he was due to visit Qatar next month to hold discussions with his counterpart and meet Nepalese workers so he could see for himself the conditions they faced.
Qatars labour minister, Abdullah bin Saleh al-Khulaifi, visited Kathmandu last month and promised to introduce a series of changes. He also revealed that his nation would need even more Nepalese workers as it strives to complete World Cup stadiums and infrastructure projects in time for 2022."

It said that of nine key issues identified by Amnesty, limited progress had been made on just five.
In the wake of a Guardian investigation in September 2013, pressure has increased on the Qatari authorities to reform the kafala laws that tie workers to their employer and to improve often dire living and working conditions.
Amnesty said that even those changes that had been promised, such as the introduction of electronic wage transfers to ensure they are paid on time, were still being implemented, and it had spoken to many migrants who still complained of late or non-payment.
The report said Qatar had also failed to meet its target to have 300 labour inspectors in place by the end of 2014 and there had been only limited progress on measures to improve safety on construction sites, regulate exploitative recruitment agencies and improve access to justice for victims of labour exploitation.
The reality is that more than a year and a half after Amnesty highlighted rampant exploitation of migrants, little has been done to address the root causes of this abuse. We are one year closer to Qatars 2022 World Cup  time for changes to be implemented is running out, said Amnestys gulf migrant rights researcher Mustafa Qadri.
With Qatars construction boom continuing and the migrant worker population set to expand to 2.5 million, the need for urgent reform is more pressing than ever.
The Qatari government disputed many of the Amnesty accusations, insisting: Significant changes have been made over the last year to improve the rights and conditions of expatriate workers.
In a statement, the government said it had appointed 294 labour inspectors, a number that it said would rise to 400 by year-end, and added that new accommodation for 250,000 workers was being built.
World footballs governing body has also come under pressure for failing to insist on meaningful reform ahead of the 2022 World Cup, controversially awarded to the tiny Gulf state in December 2010.
Fifa has spent much time, money and political capital investigating alleged corruption in the Russia and Qatar World Cup bids, and agonising over the scheduling of the tournament, said Qadri. But the organisation has yet to demonstrate any real commitment to ensuring Qatar 2022 is not built on a foundation of exploitation and abuse.
Last week it emerged that four BBC journalists had been detained on an official visit in early May to inspect conditions in migrant labour camps after being accused of trespassing.
Qadri said: Seeking to silence those documenting the conditions of migrant workers by detaining and intimidating them, sends the message that the government is more concerned about its image than dealing with the appalling reality of the tens of thousands of men and women who are abused in Qatar.
In Doha, a source close to the Qatari government said that the detention of the BBC film crew had been overinterpreted because it had happened in response to a complaint by a property-owner who said the journalists were trespassing.
There is no organised crackdown, or policy change, the source insisted. There has been a massive overinterpretation of this incident. The trend is towards more openness and engagement. This is a bump in the road.
But there was no explanation of why Mark Lobel and his three colleagues had been under surveillance, with the BBC reporter shown photographs of his activities in the days leading up to his detention by security personnel travelling in eight vehicles. Lobel said his interrogators never explained why he had been held. They had actually photographed my every move since I arrived, he said."

In the most strongly worded intervention yet from one of the eight top World Cup sponsors, the company called on Fifa to take urgent action. We continue to be troubled by the reports coming out of Qatar related to the World Cup and migrant worker conditions, it said. We have expressed our grave concern to Fifa and urge them to take all necessary actions to work with the appropriate authorities and organisations to remedy this situation and ensure the health and safety of all involved.
Visa has been a Fifa partner since 2007 and last year signed a new deal until 2022 despite the ongoing controversy around world footballs governing body. Sponsors contribute $400m a year to Fifas coffers. This week a coalition of trade union groups and MPs coordinated by Jaimie Fuller, chairman of the sportswear company Skins, called on sponsors to take a stand against the abuse of migrant workers in the tiny Gulf state.
Under severe pressure, Fifa has said it will work to ensure Qatar delivers meaningful changes to working conditions but its president, Sepp Blatter, has also claimed the situation is not its responsibility.
Meanwhile, Michael van Praag, who has been the most outspoken of the three challengers to Blatter for the Fifa presidency before next weeks election, is reportedly ready to stand down in an effort to coalesce support behind his fellow challenger Prince Ali."

Launching a campaign calling on Fifas sponsors to make a public stand in an effort to force the Qatari authorities to reform the kafala system that ties workers to their employers, members of the NewFifaNow group and the International Trade Union Confederation (Ituc)said world footballs governing body had the power to force change overnight if it chose to.
If workers are dying Fifa has blood on its hands, as do these sponsors, for as long as they turn a blind eye to whats going on there, said Collins. Its time we raise our voices. People should demand more action is taken.
Jaimie Fuller, the chairman of the sportswear brand Skins, who led a successful campaign to reform world cyclings governing body, said he had twice written to all eight of Fifas top-tier sponsors over the issue but had yet to receive a reply.
Having travelled to Qatar to obtain evidence of the squalid conditions in which many of the countrys 1.4m migrant workers live, Fuller said the sponsors  Adidas, Gazprom, Hyundai, Kia, McDonalds, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Visa  were failing to live up to their own published values.
What it says is that their moral code is lacking any kind of compass we can endorse, said Sharan Burrow, the Ituc general secretary. They wont escape scrutiny. The reputational risk for these companies is extraordinary. Theres no doubt that these companies themselves could help to change Fifa. Theyve got a choice. We hope they make it.
Fuller said that if the companies fail to engage then the next step could be to call for a boycott of their products.
Stephen Russell, from the TUC-backed fan campaign Playfair Qatar, said:Fifa can change laws to sell beers, but not to save lives. Sponsoring the World Cup with conditions as they are makes as much sense as sponsoring an oil slick.The group argued that Fifa had failed to use its leverage to secure meaningful reform for workers building the infrastructure to host the World Cup and that its sponsors were ducking the issue.
If McDonalds beef cattle lived in those conditions, you wouldnt buy their burgers, said Collins. Why should they expect the men who are building the facilities that will host a tournament they sponsor to be living in those conditions as well. The same applies for the rest of the sponsors as well."

A four-strong BBC crew had been invited by the prime ministers office on an official tour designed to show off new accommodation for migrant labourers, but were arrested by the security services while trying to gather additional material. They were interrogated and jailed for two days, before being released without charge.
The BBCs Middle East correspondent, Mark Lobel, was one of those detained, along with his cameraman, a driver and translator. Lobel said his interrogators never explained why he had been held but showed him surveillance photographs of his movements in Qatar. They had actually photographed my every move since I arrived, he said.
The visit was part of a public relations drive, partly overseen by London-based agency Portland, in the wake of an international outcry over the slave-like conditions for workers exposed by a Guardian investigation in September 2013.
Since December 2010, when Qatar won the right to stage the 2022 World Cup, its government has come under intense criticism for the poor conditions in which many of 1.4m migrants live and work.
The government defended the arrests and said the BBC crew were trespassing. A German film crew were detained last month while making a documentary, after being accused of not having a valid permit.
The BBC team were detained the week before last, but news of the incident only emerged on Monday. The journalists were later allowed to take part in the official tour of a migrant accommodation block but their equipment has not been returned.
We are pleased that the BBC team has been released but we deplore the fact that they were detained in the first place. Their presence in Qatar was no secret and they were engaged in a perfectly proper piece of journalism, said a BBC spokesperson.
The Qatari authorities have made a series of conflicting allegations to justify the detention, all of which the team rejects. We are pressing the Qatari authorities for a full explanation and for the return of the confiscated equipment.
Fifa, which has come under fire for failing to use the leverage of the World Cup to press for changes to labour laws, said: Any instance relating to an apparent restriction of press freedom is of concern to Fifa and will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves.
The Qatari governments head of communications, Saif al-Thani, said the BBC crew were arrested after departing from an official tour. He said: We gave the reporters free rein to interview whomever they chose and to roam unaccompanied in the labour villages.
Perhaps anticipating that the government would not provide this sort of access, the BBC crew decided to do their own site visits and interviews in the days leading up to the planned tour. In doing so, they trespassed on private property, which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries. Security forces were called and the BBC crew was detained.
He said other media outlets were able to report freely from the same camp the following day.
The Guardian was not present on the media tour but toured the same labour camps later that week with the assistance of Portland and the Qatari authorities, as well as visiting other camps unaccompanied.
Qatari authorities insist they are committed to reform but human rights groups have been critical of the pace of change since the dire situation for many migrant workers, whose numbers are expected to swell to 2.5m within the next five years, was exposed by the Guardian and others.
Despite some new accommodation and a new law requiring wages to be paid electronically, there has been little progress towards reform of the kafala sponsorship system that ties workers to their employers.
Nor has the government made progress on cataloguing the number of deaths and injuries among migrant workers, many of whom arrive in the country already heavily in debt due to unscrupulous recruitment agents.
Florian Bauer, one of the four journalists from German broadcaster ARD detained last month after unsuccessfully attempting to acquire a shooting permit, said it took three and a half weeks for his team to have their equipment returned. You do have a responsibility if you want to host these big sporting events to open yourself up to scrutiny, he said.
Trade unions and pressure groups also stepped up pressure on World Cup sponsors and Fifa to do more to improve workers rights and conditions.
Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), said: We remind people constantly its a police state. We have seen journalists harassed, journalists who have told us their stories. It is extraordinary they have gone to these lengths. Its the police state operating as it does without the PR company having knowledge of it.
The ITUC has been particularly virulent in its criticism of Qatars labour laws and was part of a new drive launched on Monday to persuade Fifa sponsors, including Adidas, Coca-Cola and McDonalds, to put pressure on Qatar to change.
The initiative, co-ordinated by the chairman of sportswear brand Skins, Jaimie Fuller, was also backed by Tory MP Damian Collins. Youve seen the conditions the workers are living in. If McDonalds beef cattle lived in those conditions you wouldnt buy their burgers so why should we expect the men building the facilities that will host the tournament they sponsor to be living in those conditions? said Collins, who fronts an organisation called NewFifaNow.
The same applies to the rest of the sponsors. Its not acceptable to turn a blind eye. Fifa has blood on its hands, as do the sponsors, for as long as they continue to turn a blind eye to what is going on there.

In per capita terms the Gulf state is the wealthiest country in the world, with vast natural gas reserves, a tiny native population far outstripped by an army of migrant workers and ambitions crowned by its controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Its eye-catching global investments  from Harrods to Paris St Germain football club  have been matched by an effort to punch above its weight politically in the Middle East, backing Islamist movements in particular.
Yet its recent experience has disproved the old maxim that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The World Cup bid has drawn attention to the appalling conditions in which Asian labourers live and work, while the turmoil of the Arab spring has exposed Qatar to charges of supporting extremist groups fighting in Syria. Neither, to put it mildly, have helped burnish the emirates modern image.
News of the arrest of a BBC team invited to see improvements for foreign workers is damaging too  and will doubtless have the Portland PR team grinding their teeth in frustration. It is ironic that an effort to show that Qatar is responding to complaints from trade unions, the International Labour Organisation and human rights watchdogs such as Amnesty International has backfired so badly.
Qatari officials acknowledge that Guardian coverage of the migrant labour story has been an important spur to change. Abdullah al-Khulaifi, labour minister, told me he had had nightmares as a result and felt unfairly criticised, but was still keen to highlight positive reforms  improved standards of workers accommodation, wage-payment methods and the enforcement of other rules.
The downside is that there is still no timetable for the promised abolition of the controversial kafala (sponsorship) system  which prevents workers from changing jobs for five years and leaves them open to abuse  and doubts about whether the proposed changes amount to much more than cosmetic tinkering or rebranding.
The detention of the BBC journalist Mark Lobel is doubly embarrassing because he had been invited on a press trip that was designed to showcase progress. The Guardian was able to undertake a similar officially arranged tour with Portlands help, but I also managed to visit workers housing in Dohas grim industrial zone without an escort and, happily, without being detained by security personnel.
The story illustrates a wider problem. Under the emir, Sheikh Tamim, who took over after his fathers abdication two years ago, powerful elements of the Qatari government are committed to reform and to a more transparent communications strategy. Others, clearly, are not. It is no coincidence that the kafala system remains the responsibility of the interior ministry, not Khulaifis more image-conscious ministry of labour.
Qatar is no democracy but it does not feel like a police state. Yet following reporters, covertly photographing them and throwing them into prison are not normally used to prevent trespassing  as the government claimed in a professional-looking press release that bore the imprint of Portlands expertise. PR has its uses, up to a point, but it cannot be a substitute for genuine openness."

The four-strong crew had been invited by the Qataris prime ministers office on an official tour of new accommodation for construction workers. It was part of a public relations drive in the wake of an international outcry over the slave-like conditions for workers exposed by a Guardian investigation.
But despite official permission to report in Qatar, the crew were arrested by the security services, interrogated and jailed for two days before being released without charge.
The Qatari government defended the arrests and accused the BBC crew of trespassing.
Fifa, which has been repeatedly criticised for the way Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, was helping to run the tour. It said it was investigating the arrests. Any instance relating to an apparent restriction of press freedom is of concern to Fifa and will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves, it said in a statement.
The BBCs Middle East correspondent, Mark Lobel, was one of those detained, along with his cameraman, a driver and translator.
Speaking about his ordeal, Lobel said his interrogators never explained why he had been detained but showed him surveillance photographs of his movements in Qatar. They had actually photographed my every move since I arrived, Lobel told BBC Radio 4s Today programme.
After their release, members of the team were allowed to take part in the official tour of a migrant accommodation block but their equipment remained confiscated and Qatar has offered no explanation or apology for the arrests.
We are fine, Lobel said. The worrying sign of this is that it might be a crackdown on the media to deal with the problem at the same time that other parts of the government are trying to change their image.
In an article for BBC News, he added: Whatever the explanation, Qatars Jekyll-and-Hyde approach to journalism has been exposed by the spotlight that has been thrown on it after winning the World Cup bid.
Qatars head of communications, Saif al-Thani, said the BBC crew were arrested after departing from an official tour. He said: We gave the reporters free rein to interview whomever they chose and to roam unaccompanied in the labour villages.
Perhaps anticipating that the government would not provide this sort of access, the BBC crew decided to do their own site visits and interviews in the days leading up to the planned tour. In doing so, they trespassed on private property, which is against the law in Qatar just as it is in most countries. Security forces were called and the BBC crew was detained.
No apology was issued, but Thani added: The problems that the BBC reporter and his crew experienced could have been avoided if they had chosen to join the other journalists on the press tour. They would have been able to visit  in broad daylight  the very camps they tried to break into at night. Reporters from the Associated Press, AFP, the Guardian and Le Monde have filed stories on what they saw and heard in Qatar, and we invite interested readers to review their reports, which are available online.
By trespassing on private property and running afoul of Qatari laws, the BBC reporter made himself the story. We sincerely hope that this was not his intention. Moreover, we deeply regret that he was unable to report the real story, which is that the government and the private sector are making significant progress in efforts to improve the lives and the labour conditions of guest workers in Qatar.
Human Rights Watch, which has highlighted Qatars poor record on labour conditions, described the arrests as jaw-droppingly awful PR. It pointed out that last week a German television crew was also arrested on a tour of Qatar.
HRW Gulf researcher Nicholas McGeehan said: Qatar put itself in the harshest of spotlights when it won the right to host 2022 and this is not the way to deal with the inevitable press attention. If it wants to put an end to media criticism, it needs to make some serious reforms to its labour system. Claiming that the arrest and intimidation of BBC journalists was legitimate on account of their trespassing is probably the lowest point so far in a dismal series of PR disasters."

We were told by the government that they are implementing the DLA Piper report but there is no clarity about how, when and who is responsible, said James Lynch, who was Amnestys Middle East researcher when the report was released. One of the recommendations within the report was the suggestion that a follow-up should be published 12 months later detailing progress, but a spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that no such update had been prepared.
One source who was familiar with the drawing up of the report summarised the response so far by saying: At the state level it is a case of chipping away around the edges on welfare rather than engaging on any of the major issues.
The Qatari authorities say they remain committed to delivering meaningful reform but that it will take time, and they refuse to be held to a specific timetable.
The report recommended that Qatar strengthen and enforce laws preventing recruitment agencies from charging fees. It urged the authorities to go further and prohibit employers from dealing with any fee-charging recruitment agencies in countries of origin. This would attempt to deal with the middlemen who charge large fees and over-promise to impoverished workers, leaving them trapped in debt. Nepal and Qatar have made it illegal for agencies to charge large fees, but the practice continues unabated. Last September, the authorities said they had launched an inspection drive targeting the recruitment agencies of domestic workers. But when the Qatari minister for labour visited Kathmandu in April, he was lobbied by Nepalese officials to implement better insurance policies and require employers to pay any fees illegally charged by recruitment agencies.
Human rights groups have long called for fundamental reform of the kafala system in Qatar and its neighbouring Gulf states, believing it underpins a form of modern slavery. The DLA Piper report recommended a wide ranging and comprehensive review of kafala with a view to abolishing or phasing out certain aspects of the system and prioritising freedom of movement and the rights of workers. It said that over time it should be abolished altogether. But in the 12 months since the report, there has been no change. The alternative of a five-year limit, proposed by the Qataris, which led some to report that kafala would be abolished, has been criticised by human rights groups. They believe that tying employees to their employer for up to five years will, in effect, codify the practice under another name. Meanwhile, an increase in labour inspectors has led to existing laws prohibiting the confiscation of passports being better enforced. However, critics wants stiffer penalties for those who fail to comply.
This is another area where the government has promised reforms but there is no timetable for delivery. The proposed changes do not go as far as human rights groups wanted in abolishing the system, which allows employers to prevent their employees from leaving Qatar altogether. Under the proposed changes, an employee would be free to leave the country but employers would have up to 72 hours to apply to block their departure if they had reasonable grounds. However, in the past 12 months there has been no further detail on how the proposed law would work or a timetable for its introduction.
The report said worker welfare standards, such as those introduced in February 2014 by the Qatar 2022 World Cup organisers, should be made mandatory in all contracts issued by public authorities. Similar standards have been introduced by the Qatar Foundation, a not-for-profit state funding arm responsible for several major infrastructure projects. But so far there is little sign of similar standards being introduced more widely. A parallel recommendation to introduce rules to make lead contractors responsible for compliance through their web of subcontractors  which would go a long way to making major global construction firms responsible for those at the bottom of the chain  has not led to any progress.
The report calls for consideration to be given to introducing a minimum wage but the ministry for labour has confirmed that such a move is not on the agenda. Shortly before the DLA Piper report came out Qatar announced a new system for the automatic payment of wages electronically, seen as a positive change. Under the amendment to the labour law in February, businesses were given six months to comply. But the changes will only benefit those who receive a regular salary, not those without a formal contract.
The DLA Piper report called for contractors who breached health and safety standards to be blacklisted and for the introduction of stronger criminal sanctions, as well as joint liability for contractors (often major western companies) and their sub-contractors. Again, those on the ground say there is little to report. There have been some practical changes, such as the legal requirement to provide an onsite nurse for every accommodation block that houses 100 workers or more, and new rules increasing the minimum amount of space for each worker by 50%.
The Qatari authorities have long argued that death figures for migrant workers paint an incomplete picture because they fail to take into account how they were killed or compare them with rates in other countries. But a key recommendation from the DLA Piper report  the regular collection and reporting of statistics regarding work-related injuries and deaths, to be published anonymously every six months  has yet to be enacted. In light of apparently unusually high levels of heart attacks, DLA Piper also called for an independent study into sudden cardiac arrests over the next three years and for there to be proper investigations into unexpected or sudden deaths. No such studies have been announced, despite Qatari officials insisting they are committed to collating and investigating such figures.
Recommendations included a mandatory induction for new employees, a worker welfare officer on every site, better monitoring and inspection, and better complaints procedures. The Qataris point to increased numbers of inspectors and the imminent construction of vast new accommodation complexes as evidence they are determined to improve conditions. But with Qatars 1.6 million migrant workers expected by the government to swell to 2.5 million over the next five years, it remains unclear whether it will be possible to raise standards fast enough to keep pace.
Qatar has claimed that the number and frequency of inspections has increased but DLA Piper said more needed to be done so that the labour inspections department could perform its task with sufficient coverage and rigour. It wanted better training for inspectors, more powers, more interpreters for worker interviews and more transparency. The Qataris insist that the increased number of inspectors is starting to have the desired effect, but widespread examples of mistreatment on the ground remain. It increased the number of inspectors from 200 to 243 last year, but critics say this is far from enough."

work conditions improved? Migrant labourers tell their stories,"Its an incongruous location for a cricket stadium. In the shimmering heat of Dohas industrial zone, amid a wasteland of low-rise factories, garages and unpaved roads, the 24,000-seater venue, complete with electronic scoreboard and a healthy-looking grass pitch, seems out of place.
The new ground was built for Qatars legion of south Asian labourers to relax in during the few leisure hours they get  just one of the improvements being trumpeted by the authorities as they move to tackle the horrendous living and working conditions exposed by the Guardian.
Not far away, workers are putting the finishing touches to an elegant, high-ceilinged mosque. Outside the hyper mall there is even a little fairground.
But the most striking novelty is the recently opened Labour City  providing spacious, air-conditioned rooms for four with storage lockers, TV viewing areas and centralised catering services where Egyptian, Lebanese and Filipino managers look after the army of Indians, Nepalese, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans toiling in the super-wealthy Gulf states 40C heat.
Hopefully we will eliminate the words labour camp and talk about labour cities in the future, declared Abdulla al-Khulaifi, Qatars minister of labour. We have had the good, the bad and the ugly. This is the new benchmark. Plans have been drawn up for seven such cities to house the 280,000 additional migrants expected to be working on a £137bn construction spree in advance of the 2022 World Cup.
With the prized  and controversial  event finally in the bag after being shifted to the cooler winter months, the emirate is anxious to raise its game and polish an image battered by the abuses of its kafala (labour sponsorship) system, which severely restricts the rights and freedoms of migrant workers.
The improved housing looks impressive. The new rooms could be mistaken for college dorms in the US or Europe. Alcohol and cooking are banned but Wi-Fi, table tennis and laundry facilities are standard. We dont want them getting bored so we try to keep them busy, said property manager Emmanuel Encinares Austria. Pretty much everything is looked after.
Each beige-coloured block will house 1,250 workers. The canteen choice of Asian, Arabic or Filipino food served on metal trays is basic but carbohydrate-rich for men who work outside in punishing physical conditions, anonymous in overalls and safety helmets, faces masked against the dust.
But elsewhere in the industrial zone it is the same old story: eight men to a single claustrophobic room, dirt-encrusted kitchens with exposed gas canisters, insanitary and inadequate toilet facilities, corridors obstructed by drying clothes.
In one of the many streets that have neither names nor identifying features, a building with a makeshift mosque at the back was being partially refurbished after the owners were warned to clean up or face hefty fines or blacklisting following a labour ministry inspection two weeks ago.
Its OK here, shrugged Ramesh, a stocky Nepalese security guard who looked uncomfortable speaking in front of Qatari officials keen to showcase the stricter enforcement. Ive been here for seven years. But not much has changed.
In another accommodation block round the corner, where Egyptians, Indians and Bangladeshis are served by a small company-owned shop, the work was more advanced, the kitchen walls now covered in hygienic white tiles.
On another, unescorted visit the Guardian found further examples of unedifying living conditions. Eight Nepalese construction workers shared a room with a small table squeezed between their bunks, watched over by the Hindu god Shiva from a shoe-box-sized cardboard shrine. There were no lockers. The air conditioning provided relief from the scorching heat outside but when it broke down it could take days to repair.
Three months ago the whole building was suddenly given a thorough cleaning on the orders of the local council  another of several signs of mounting state pressure on private sector employers and landlords. The labour ministry has boosted its complement of inspectors to nearly 300.
Yet better accommodation is far from the whole picture. The Qatari government highlights the introduction of a new direct bank payment system that employers are required to comply with by August  a response to widespread complaints about late or non-payment of wages. We still get our salaries in cash but we do usually get paid on time, said Bhaktabahadur, a Nepalese construction worker  like all his roommates a skinny man in T-shirt and flip-flops  and, in common with others, unwilling to give his full name.
Anecdotal evidence from random conversations and NGO monitoring suggests more companies are also complying with the new requirement to allow employees to keep their own passports  often withheld as a means of control and intimidation, though some firms claim it is simply for reasons of efficiency. Ilham, a Sri Lankan carpenter, said his employer still had his passport though he could get it back when he needed it. Information about enforcement is scanty, however.
Low pay and long hours are major preoccupations. Duncan Njunge, a Kenyan security guard earning 1,600 Qatari riyals (£280) a month for a 12-hour day, said his living conditions had improved significantly recently. He also has his own passport. The most important thing is to increase the salary and cut working hours, he said. But theres nowhere to go and if you do take a day off you will spend money instead of earning it. The new cricket ground does not appeal.
Their conditions are not good, admitted Aarav, an Indian employing 90 Asians, including carpenters and steel fixers working on a World Cup stadium site, on salaries ranging from QR900-QR1,200, plus overtime. My workers are extremely poor, he said. They beg me to increase their salaries.
Shubash, a decorator, has been in Qatar for four years and still earns the QR950 that was agreed with the middleman he met in Kathmandu, where he got his air ticket and visa to Doha. I am not satisfied given the amount of work I do, he said. The salary is based on the contract I signed at the beginning and they wont increase it however hard I work or however good I am.
Mahendra has other worries. Everything is OK but there is a problem with dust or gas, maybe from the plant nearby. I often have a sore throat in the morning. We all suffer from that. We have tried complaining to the accountant, whos also from Nepal, but we dont know if he told the company.
Complaints can cause problems if aired too publicly. There is a perpetual fear of losing your job or being deported so you get a stamp in your passport that stops you working, said Sayeed Mohammed, an independent researcher. If a camp boss knows someone has talked to a journalist about his problems with the company he would be fired. Activists face harassment and pressure if they are too high profile. Trade unions remain illegal; there is no minimum wage.
Nepalese and Bangladeshi workers are at the bottom of the heap, with the lowest pay and worst conditions. Other migrants say the kafala system treats them reasonably well  and includes prospects for mobility.
Vijay, a cheerful 32-year old from Kerala in India, began working in Qatar as a welder 10 years ago, earning QR1,200 and sharing a squalid room with nine others in the Doha industrial zone. Now he earns five times as much, drives a smart SUV for his Indian employer, has his own passport and is looking forward to a visit by his wife and child. Vijay knows he was lucky, not least because his passable English has given him wider job choices.
Mahmoud Asif, sprawled with three Nepalese friends, all office employees, on the spiky grass on the Doha Corniche, where the old wooden dhows are a picturesque reminder of simpler days in the Gulf, also counts himself as fortunate. Many workers dont get any holidays and dont get paid on time, he reflected. We are three in a room but many are eight. In some sectors, especially domestic work, it really feels like slave labour.
External scrutiny and pressure appears to be working  up to a point. I am making progress, Khulaifi insisted, but I wont be satisfied until the international media has nothing to write about to give me nightmares. We dont want people to compliment us or thank us, but to know that we Qataris are serious.
Ricardo, a Filipino who has been in Doha for seven years and had to wait for four before he was given his passport back, gives the emirate a mixed review. There have been a lot of changes because of the World Cup, he said. The accommodation is improving. We used to be seven in a room and since 2013 we are three. Its OK. But friends of mine earn much more than I do and Im not allowed to change jobs. Im still waiting for them to change the sponsorship system."

Thawadi said work had been carried out so far on beginning to build or revamp five stadiums in preparation for footballs biggest competition, which will take place in the Gulf state in 2022.
We have had about 4.8m working hours. Weve got about just over 2,500 workers and about five stadiums  we are at the early stages of construction, said Thawadi.
The World Cup stadium projects that we are responsible for, there have been no fatalities and no major injuries as well.
Thawadis comments come amid concerns over the treatment of tens of thousands of migrant labourers working on infrastructure projects and facilities for the World Cup in seven years time.
Last year it was claimed that Nepalese workers building infrastructure  not stadiums  in Qatar were dying at the rate of one every two days because of poor working practices in searing hot temperatures.
One claim last year estimated that as many as 4,000 migrant workers will die by the time the tournament takes place.
Qatars labour minister said on Monday he hoped kafala would be abolished before the end of this year. Under the scheme, employers in the Gulf kingdom can prevent foreign workers from changing jobs or leaving the country.
Dr Abdullah bin Saleh al-Khulaifi, the minister of labour and social affairs, said he was 90% certain the system would be replaced within the next seven months.
I hope it will be prior to the year end, he said. I am 90% hopeful or believe that it will be.
We discussed it, our stakeholders have looked at it  Now it is on track.
Do I believe it will come out positively? Yes I do. Because at the end of the day I believe it is good for the economy, its good for the country.
Doha says it will replace the system with one based instead on employment contracts lasting a maximum of five years. The current exit permit system would be replaced with one where workers give the authorities a maximum of 72 hours notice that they want to leave the country.
The proposed reform has been discussed by the cabinet and is currently being considered by Qatars Shura council, an assembly that has the power to draft new laws.
Khulaifi also said Qatar would fully implement another major labour reform by mid-August: an electronic payment system to ensure thousands of migrant labourers get paid at least once a month and, in some cases, every fortnight. Many have complained that payment of their salaries are often delayed.
Mustafa Qadri, Gulf migrant rights researcher for Amnesty International, welcomed any change but said more was needed.
Its another form of kafala with a different name, admittedly less restrictive but with many of the same problems.
He added that contract arrangements and the ability to leave the country would still be a situation of forced labour because the employer still has the power over the employee.
Khulaifi claimed the reported number of deaths in the public domain for those from large immigrant groups such as Nepal, India or Bangladesh was wrong.
The grand total of deaths among the biggest nationalities is by far less than what has been circulated in the media, by far, he said.
He said 194 Nepalese people were killed in Qatar during 2014 but did not explain how they died or if they were working on infrastructure projects."

The Paris government announced at the weekend there was enough evidence for it to open a preliminary inquiry into Vinci Construction.
The move follows a complaint by the non-governmental organisation Sherpa. The investigation will centre on whether Vinci and its Qatari subsidiary QDVC is using forced labour, servitude and concealment with regard to sites in Qatar including building for the football tournament.
Vinci has denied the accusations claiming it provides migrant workers with decent working conditions. The company says it is suing Sherpa for defamation.
The preliminary investigation reportedly began two weeks ago and is expected to last several months. It aims to verify allegations made by Sherpa, the French prosecutor Catherine Denis said at the weekend. A formal inquiry will follow if investigators find evidence to support the humanitarian organisations claims.
Vinci, which has an annual turnover of 40bn (£29bn) employs 191,000 workers around the world. It won a number of major contracts in Qatar, including the construction of a tramway and metro system, through its local subsidiary QDVC.
Sherpa welcomed the investigation. A statement on its website read as follows: Modern slavery does not consist of shackling and whipping workers. It is subtler; the penal code defines a vulnerable population, under the threat of an employer and extreme economical dependency, as having no choice but to accept the deplorable working conditions and therefore renew its contract.
In its legal claim, the NGO said: Passports were confiscated by the company and workers were threatened if they claimed their right to better working conditions and housing, if they wished to resign or change employer. The passport confiscations were allegedly halted in January this year.
Xavier Huillard, the CEO of Vinci, told Le Figaro newspaper earlier this month: Up until the beginning of this year we did, in effect, keep workers passports. However, he said this was not done under force.
Huillard said: The holders gave them to us voluntarily, signing a consent form in their own language, to avoid the risk of them being stolen or destroyed. They could, of course, have them back at any time. He said the company employed thousands of workers from Nepal, Sri Lanka and India ... who live in conditions that are of the highest standard.
The world football authority, FIFA, has come under intense pressure from human rights groups to review its decision to award the emirate state the 2022 World Cup. In turn, it has put pressure on Qatar to give assurances that workplace safety, housing, pay and employment conditions would be improved for the large foreign workforce being used to prepare for the tournament."

As Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, guaranteed once and for all there would be no revote and rolled out his repertoire of non-sequiturs, he also surrendered one of the last levers world football had left to force meaningful change for migrant workers in Qatar.
In repeating his promise to Qatar that the World Cup was going nowhere, Blatter also made a mockery of a warning earlier in the week from the German Fifa executive Theo Zwanziger, who heads a taskforce on the issue, that it could yet be taken from them if workers rights did not improve.
To the frustration of human rights groups and those who have campaigned for better protection and conditions, the momentum for fundamental reform of the kafala system that ties workers to their employers seems to be petering out.
The year began with further grim revelations of the rising death toll among migrant workers helping build infrastructure for the even but also amid genuine guarded optimism that structural change was on the way.
But 2014 has ended in frustration and claims from Amnesty that Qatar is dragging its feet. The Guardians investigations in 2013 and in-depth, shocking research by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, prompted soul searching in Qatar and outrage from the wider public.
Senior football adminstrators such as Michel Platini, who was among those who voted for Qatar as hosts in the first place, looked at the film of coffins arriving in Kathmandu and read the stories of workers trapped in hospital with no passport or money and exclaimed it the most pressing issue facing Qatar.
For a few months, the much-discussed debate about whether the World Cup should be played in winter to protect players from temperatures that regularly topped 50 degrees receded into the background as concern for those toiling in the heat day in, day out topped the agenda.
Even the ongoing questions about how Qatar won the right to host the tournament in the first place  part of a global dash for legitimacy that includes burning through billions to showcase their country through sport  faded temporarily. There was quiet confidence among human rights bodies and the more liberal Qataris who want to see change that something fundamental was about to happen as a report commissioned from international law firm DLA Piper in the wake of the Guardians initial stories neared publication.
But that report was never even formally published. Its 60-plus recommendations only ever saw the light of day thanks to some judicious leaking and the chaotic press conference that was supposed to accompany its unveiling in May was bereft of senior officials and prompted a mass outbreak of head-scratching.
While some welcome reforms were announced, they fell well short of abolishing the exit visa system that can leave workers trapped in Qatar without pay or fundamentally reforming the kafala system.
While the Qatari government was able to say it planned to get rid of kafala, it often forget to add that they are replacing it with something just a little less draconian. Instead of indefinitely tying workers to an employer, it will now do so for the length of their contract  which could still be up to five years.
There has been some progress. The Supreme Committee, the body overseeing the construction of the stadiums for the World Cup, is making a big noise about the reforms and standards it has introduced for workers.
This week, it released its first Workers Welfare Compliance Report in which it flagged up improvements to worker accommodation and new forums that bring together contractors and workers to discuss concerns.
It is clear that those with most to lose and those mostly in the spotlight recognise the need to be seen to be doing something. Other practical moves  increased numbers of inspectors, a law that requires wages to be paid electronically  will help.
But the nagging fear is that they add up to window dressing rather than the long-term commitment to structural change that will properly protect all of the 1.4 million workers fuelling a £137bn construction boom once the Fifa circus has moved on.
Meanwhile, the culture and practices of the big western construction firms and architects who have flocked to the Doha honeypot also deserve more scrutiny. Hiding behind subcontractors should no longer be an option. And just because British politicians crave the investment that the region can provide for big infrastructure projects  see the recent revelation that London mayor, Boris Johnson, tried to persuade the Qataris to plough money into Tottenhams regeneration  that shouldnt stop them asking tough questions over migrant labour.
Some of those close to the ground in Qatar believe that reassurances over their status as World Cup hosts will embolden the gas-rich country to make changes that could set new labour standards for the region. Others fear that without the threat of it being taken away, momentum will slow still further.
The Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, professed that he was personally hurt about the situation when he travelled to meet Cameron and other European leaders in September. He still has the chance to do something about it and implementing the DLA Piper report in full would be a start."

The figure excludes deaths of Indian, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi workers, raising fears that if fatalities among all migrants were taken into account the toll would almost certainly be more than one a day.
Qatar had vowed to reform the industry after the Guardian exposed the desperate plight of many of its migrant workers last year. The government commissioned an investigation by the international law firm DLA Piper and promised to implement recommendations listed in a report published in May.
But human rights organisations have accused Qatar of dragging its feet on the modest reforms, saying not enough is being done to investigate the effect of working long hours in temperatures that regularly top 50C.
The Nepalese foreign employment promotion board said 157 of its workers in Qatar had died between January and mid-November this year  67 of sudden cardiac arrest and eight of heart attacks. Thirty-four deaths were recorded as workplace accidents.
Figures sourced separately by the Guardian from Nepalese authorities suggest the total during that period could be as high as 188. In 2013, the figure from January to mid-November was 168.
We know that people who work long hours in high temperatures are highly vulnerable to fatal heat strokes, so obviously these figures continue to cause alarm, said Nicholas McGeehan, the Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Its Qatars responsibility to determine if deaths are related to living and working conditions, but Qatar flatly rejected a DLA Piper recommendation to launch an immediate investigation into these deaths last year.
Some within Qatar suggest the cardiac arrest death rates could be comparable to those among Nepalese workers of a similar age at home. The Indian embassy argued this year that the number of deaths was in line with the average in their home country. But in the absence of robust research or any attempt to catalogue the cause of death, human rights organisations say it is impossible to properly compare figures.
A series of stories in the Guardian have shown that migrant workers from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere were dying in their hundreds. While some were listed as having been killed in workplace accidents, many more were said to have died from sudden, unexplained cardiac arrest.
The government confirmed in the DLA Piper report that 964 workers from Nepal, India and Bangladesh had died while living and working in the Gulf state in 2012 and 2013.
The report recommended that Qatar do more to record and investigate the causes of death among the migrant population but it has made little outward progress.
After it was published, Qatar said it would reform the kafala system that keeps workers tied to their employer, and better enforce laws that require contractors to provide humane living conditions and ban them from seizing passports.
But the system that Qatar proposed to replace kafala would still leave workers tied to their employer for the length of their contract, which could be as much as five years.
Rather than scrapping the exit visa system, which in effect allows employers to stop their charges leaving the country without permission, Qatar proposed a complex procedure that still allowed employers to raise objections.
There are about 400,000 Nepalese workers in Qatar among the 1.4 million migrants working on a £137bn construction spree in the tiny Gulf state. Many travel to Doha having borrowed money from unscrupulous recruitment agencies, only to find the wages and conditions on offer differ significantly from those promised.
The Qatar government also points to increases in the number of labour inspectors and new laws requiring wages to be paid by electronic transfer as evidence that it is serious about improving workers rights and conditions.
But an Amnesty International report last month warned that Qatar was dragging its feet when it came to making meaningful changes.
Despite making repeated promises to clean up its act ahead of the World Cup, the government of Qatar still appears to be dragging its feet over some of the most fundamental changes needed, such as abolishing the exit permit and overhauling its abusive sponsorship system, it said.
Six months later, only a handful of the limited measures announced in May have even been partially implemented. Overall, the steps taken so far are woefully insufficient.
In November the Qatari ministry of labour issued a statement saying it was doing everything possible to improve working conditions. We believe that the people helping us build our country deserve to be fairly paid, humanely treated and protected against exploitation, it said. That is why we are reforming our labour laws and practices.
We fully appreciate there is much more to do but, as in every country in the world, change does not happen overnight. Significant changes such as these take more time to implement than some may wish, but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in Qatar."

Around 150 workers were paid to be fans at the Qatar Open of international beach volleyball last month  an event that the FIVB, volleyballs governing body, said on its website had brought out the crowds.
But migrants from Ghana, Kenya, Nepal and elsewhere, who work in Qatar as bus and taxi drivers for the state-owned transport company and for other employers, said they were there for the money, not the volleyball.
The French players Edouard Rowlandson and Youssef Krou were winning their bronze-medal match as the workers arrived to fill seats, making the arena appear almost full. Rowlandson called the scene bizarre  but we prefer that to playing in front of nobody.
The FIVBs media director, Richard Baker, said the federation was unaware of the fake fans, and would seek clarification from Qatari organisers.

The issue is not a new one. A survey of 1,079 Qatar residents published in January by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics suggested that paid fans may be turning Qataris off sport.
The ministry said two-thirds of Qataris surveyed did not attend any football matches during the previous season and two-thirds of respondents cited the spread of paid fans as a significant factor in keeping audiences away.
At the volleyball, some for-hire spectators were offered less than others. Security guards and office boys from Kenya said a promise of 20 riyals (£3.50) each drew 40 people on to their bus. A Nigerian said he, too, was getting just 20.
Numerous workers said they regularly make up numbers at sports events. Qatar league football games pay 20 or 25 riyals, they said. A Kenyan said he made 50 riyals at handball.
At the volleyball arena, which had free Wi-Fi, workers were seen checking messages and emails on their phones, ignoring a crowd organiser waving a plastic hand who urged them to clap to Daft Punks Get Lucky.
Pitching successfully in November to track and fields governing body to host its world athletics championships in 2019, the Qatar bid presenter, Aphrodite Moschoudi, said: Qatar has a true passion for sports. Everything in our country revolves around sport.
Meanwhile, Fifa has been urged to stage the Qatar 2022 World Cup in May and June, with the European Club Association arguing that games can be played at night without putting the health of players, supporters and officials at risk."

Letters released under the Freedom of Information Act show the mayor of London heaped praise on 2022 World Cup plans and suggested that Qatari officials should consider redeveloping the area around Tottenham Hotspurs ground in the north of the city.
The request was made in February to Hassan al-Thawadi, the head of the Qatar legacy committee and the former chief executive of the emirates successful World Cup bid. The committee says that Qatar has not become involved in Tottenham.
But Johnsons invitation has angered MPs and campaigners who have accused the Qatari government of the large-scale exploitation of workers as it attempts to build stadia in time for the 2022 tournament. Qatar was a surprise winner to hold international footballs most prestigious cup.
Steve Murphy, the general secretary of the construction workers union UCATT, said that he was disgusted by Johnsons attempt to involve the Qataris.
I find it obscene the way the mayor of London is touting huge swaths of London land to the Qatari state while turning a blind eye to the human rights abuses being perpetuated against migrant workers in Qatar, he said.
Diane Abbott, the MP standing for Labours London mayor nomination, said: Boris seems happy to offer Tottenham as a possible investment opportunity but ignores Qatars treatment of foreign workers and the dodgy World Cup bid. It confirms that behind the bonhomie and the blond mop is an amoral politician.
Johnsons letter was sent in February following a meeting in central London between the mayor and senior members of Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.
In the letter addressed to Thawadi, Johnson praises Qatars plans for the World Cup, writing: I have no doubt that Qatar will put on a truly wonderful Fifa World Cup in 2022.
Johnson goes on to point out that Arsenals stadium in Highbury, north London, was one of Londons successful redevelopments.
The Emirates stadium is one of several successful examples of regeneration projects in London. As the transport and wider infrastructure improves across the capital, for example in Tottenham and the Lea Valley, other similar investment opportunities are becoming more visible.
Should you wish to have a further discussion my team would welcome the chance to speak with possible partners to consider options at different sites.
I would like to suggest that Neale Coleman, my adviser on Tottenham and deputy chair of the London Legacy Development Corporation, is your point of contact for information about London 2012 and opportunities in Tottenham.
A week later, Thawadi responded: As per my previous letter, Mr Ahmad Nimeh, senior adviser for business development will be the focal point of contact and he shall be contacting Mr Coleman to follow up on certain matters that were discussed during our meeting.
The decision to award Qatar the 2022 tournament in December 2010 was hugely controversial, prompting an avalanche of allegations about the way it won the bid and concerns about the searing heat in which it would be played and the treatment of migrant workers building the infrastructure underpinning it.
In November, Qatar was cleared to host the tournament after Fifas ethics committee ruled any breaches of the rules were only of very limited scope and closed its investigation into the controversial bidding process.
A report released last month by Amnesty International said the countrys authorities are severely lagging behind on efforts to address the rampant abuse of migrant workers rights.
A series of stories in the Guardian have shown that migrant workers from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere were dying in their hundreds. While some were listed as having been killed in workplace accidents, many more were said to have died due to sudden, unexplained cardiac arrest.
Spurs plan to develop a new 56,000-capacity stadium next to White Hart Lane by 2017 includes a scheme in the surrounding area to build 200 homes, a supermarket and a public square for community events such as ice skating or street markets. The clubs chairman, Daniel Levy, said in 2011 that he required private finance to make it happen.
The Qatar Foundation has sponsored Barcelonas shirts but the purchase of Paris St-Germain means it may not be allowed to buy more than 25% of another club in European competition, according to Uefa regulations.
A spokesperson for Johnson said that overseas investment contributes billions of pounds to the London economy and creates thousands of new jobs, and that the mayors team works hard to position London as the city of choice for international investors.
The mayor and his team continue to promote opportunities to invest in major London regeneration projects, including those in Tottenham, to overseas investors, including from Qatar, he said.
A spokesman for Tottenham Hotspur said the plans are going ahead but the club is not in discussions with Qatari officials.
A spokeswoman for the Qatar World Cup committee said: The Supreme Committee holds itself and its contractors accountable for ensuring that the highest standards of health and safety are upheld on Supreme Committee construction sites and in worker accommodation. There have been no fatalities on any Supreme Committee project, including proposed FIFA World Cup stadia."

Speaking during a visit to Sri Lanka, the Fifa president said the workers were employed by companies from Germany, France and other European countries and they are responsible for their workers and not Fifa.
Blatter also said the workers were enjoying better conditions due to the World Cup.
Qatar has come under increasing scrutiny over its labour practices since Fifa awarded it the right to host the tournament. The wealthy OPEC nation relies heavily on migrant workers drawn mainly from South Asia to build its roads, skyscrapers and stadiums.
A series of stories in the Guardian showed that migrant workers from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere were dying in their hundreds.
Many more were injured in workplace accidents, some left trapped with no passport or insurance, and huge numbers toiled in extreme heat for low wages and lived in inhumane conditions.
The government confirmed in a report that 964 workers from Nepal, India and Bangladesh had died while living and working in the Gulf state in 2012 and 2013."

Sunday brought revelations of a dossier of new allegations. Theres the allegedly corrupt means by which Qatar is rumoured to have bought the tournament, the deaths of more than 2,000 migrant workers who have toiled in slave-like conditions and, of course, Qatars weather. The tournament is to be held in summer when temperatures routinely soar above 40C, posing risks to the players as well as to millions of visiting fans.
Many people feel Qatar should not host the tournament. But how to bring this about with Qatars consent, without the emirate losing face  such an important consideration in the Arab world  and bringing multiple legal challenges?
Heres one idea: Qatar should take the high ground by announcing that it will heed calls by an outgoing Fifa official for the tournament to be moved to other Arab lands. It should give the World Cup to Gaza. And Qatar should pay for it too.
The idea is not as far-fetched as it may seem. Gazas key problem is not money, but rule by militant Islamism, combined with hopelessness. Indeed, Gaza has received billions in aid over the years  but its Hamas rulers have never shared this properly with the population. The Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, among others, flies around in a Qatari-provided private jet. Recently Forbes rated Hamas the second richest terrorist group in the world  poorer than Isis but considerably richer than the Taliban and other groups.
As long as Hamas maintains its grip on the territory Israel will respond with force. So how to prevent the next Gaza war? For the first time in history almost the entire Arab world backed Israel  albeit tacitly  in last summers campaign against Hamas. The one exception was Qatar (as well as non-Arab regimes in Turkey and Iran).
And consider this. Football is almost a secular religion for millions of people throughout the world. I know from my own visits there that Gaza is no exception. (Readers may have noticed from photos during the recent conflict how many Gazans were wearing the shirts of leading European teams.)
What other force is great enough to pull Gazans from the lure of Hamas, restore a sense of pride and purpose, create thousands of jobs, and direct billions of dollars into the territory  to be used to transform the strip into a prime Mediterranean tourist hub? Hamas would, of course, object but football is such a powerful force in Gazan society that it would be hard even for the its leadership to justify to its own people its continued focus on jihadi activities.
Such an idea may sound implausible at first, but only if you disregard other historical examples of the healing power of football. For example, the Miracle of Berne in 1954 when West Germany won the World Cup, a victory that played a role in reviving the country and accelerating its economic recovery. In the days after the game, Uli Hesse, the respected German journalist, wrote, the country celebrated like seldom before and never since.
Gaza is a small territory, but so is Qatar, whose population is smaller than Gazas. And if Gaza is too small to host all the matches, why not also allow Ramallah, Cairo and even Tel Aviv to host a few. The 2022 final should be played in Gaza, of course, and Gazans could rejoice in this, after decades of perceived humiliation. I suspect Israelis  so long as security was not an issue  would welcome the idea with great enthusiasm. It would, one hopes, buy eight years of quiet, economic development and reconstruction in which the focus in Gaza could be taken off conflict with Israel and radical Islamism. An unusual idea? Perhaps. But can anyone think of a better one?"

For those 19 months Belounis, 34, was denied an exit visa because he was in dispute with the Qatari club El Jaish over unpaid wages and was only allowed to leave in the autumn of 2013.
Hamad is one of the most influential figures in Qatari sport and was among those who presented Dohas case to the International Association of Athletics Federations in Monaco on Tuesday.
But as well as being president of the Qatar Athletics Federation and an IAAF vice-president, Hamad is also president of the Military Sports Federation and El Jaish, with which Belounis was in dispute over unpaid wages.
Belounis, whose wife and two young children were with him, became a symbolic totem for those protesting against Qatars kafala system, under which workers are tied to their employers and cannot leave the country without permission.
He was finally released in November last year following a concerted international campaign that included an open letter to the Qatar 2022 World Cup ambassadors Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola that was published in the Guardian.
But Belounis, who said he had returned from Qatar mentally unfit to play football again and is now living in Spain and working as a waiter, said the dispute had ruined his career. I was surprised when I saw him [Hamad] in Monaco. He was the president of the club. I was surprised that he didnt care about my situation. He came and it was like they did nothing wrong, said Belounis.
They destroyed me but they carry on. Nobody cared about me. Nobody has called me since I left the country, even to apologise. I lost my career, I lost everything. I was sad on Tuesday. There are no words.
Human-rights organisations have criticised the IAAF for not forcing the Qatari authorities to sign up to clear commitments on the treatment of migrant workers in advance of the 2019 World Athletics Championships.
The Qatar government insists it is taking the issue seriously and has promised a series of reforms, including the replacement of kafala with a contract-based system. But human-rights organisations remain sceptical. A recent Amnesty report said the government was dragging its feet and the proposed reforms did not go far enough, representing a missed opportunity.
Nobody apologised. They said they would reform but nothing has happened, said Belounis. He is president of the association of athletics. When he goes home he has his family, he has a happy life. But what about me?
Hamad is one of three Qatari officials against whom Belounis is taking legal action in the French courts, with prosecutors currently looking into whether there is a case for them to answer. Belounis said he plans to return to France next year.
But its so hard to go back  everybody knows my story and I dont want to talk about my story all the time. I have to refund the people who helped me, I have to live, he said. I dont want to continue this fight all my life but I want them to acknowledge they were not fair with me. They ruined my life and they destroyed me just because I complained against them to the courts.
Belounis played in the lower divisions in France and Switzerland before moving to Qatar in 2007. He was initially successful but fell out with El Jaish in 2010 when he was loaned to a second division club and they refused to pay him the wages he claimed he was owed. He said that he became depressed and was driven to the brink of suicide by the situation.
Belounis also criticised the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, who invited him to Zurich in March this year in the wake of his high-profile case but has been of little assistance since.
They destroyed me. I was depressed. Nobody cares about that. I met Sepp Blatter in March when he invited me to Zurich, he said. He told me he was sorry for me and that it was difficult. But that was it. I have heard nothing since."

improvements to its treatment of migrant workers, Amnesty International has warned that its progress so far is woefully inadequate and accused the Gulf state of dragging its feet.
In the wake of the international outcry that followed Guardian investigations that revealed the desperate plight of many of Qatars army of migrant workers, the government commissioned international law firm DLA Piper to undertake a comprehensive review. It reported its findings in May and made more than 60 recommendations.
In turn, Qatar promised to reform the much-criticised kafala system and do more to enforce existing laws to protect the rights of immigrant workers.
Amnesty said that while there had been increased acknowledgement from senior Qatari figures of the scale of the problem, not enough was being done to enact even the limited recommendations made in the DLA Piper report.
In September, on a tour of Europe that included a meeting with David Cameron at 10 Downing St, the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, said he was personally hurt about the situation. But Amnesty Internationals head of refugee and migrant rights, Sherif Elsayed-Ali, said time was fast running out.
Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup tournament that is built on forced labour and exploitation, he said.
Despite making repeated promises to clean up its act ahead of the World Cup, the government of Qatar still appears to be dragging its feet over some of the most fundamental changes needed, such as abolishing the exit permit and overhauling its abusive sponsorship system.
Six months later, only a handful of the limited measures announced in May have even been partially implemented. Overall the steps taken so far are woefully insufficient.
A series of stories in the Guardian have shown that migrant workers from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere were dying in their hundreds. While some were listed as having been killed in workplace accidents, many more were listed as having been killed by sudden, unexplained cardiac arrest.
The government confirmed in the DLA Piper report that 964 workers from Nepal, India and Bangladesh had died while living and working in the Gulf state in 2012 and 2013.
Many more were injured in workplace accidents, some left trapped in limbo with no passport or insurance, and huge numbers toiled in extreme heat for low wages and lived in inhumane conditions.
Often, they had been recruited by unscrupulous agents in their home countries who then demanded repayment of loans and found them jobs on far lower wages than promised. Some found themselves held to ransom, unable to return home unless they gave up their claims to unpaid wages because their passports were held by their employer. When the scale of the problem came to light the International Trade Union Confederation estimated that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked at the 2022 World Cup. The issue gained traction partly because many of the migrant workers in Qatar, a population estimated at between 1.4 million and 1.8 million, are working on infrastructure projects that will underpin the contentious tournament.
The Qatari government has claimed that its proposed changes to the kafala sponsorship system, which ties migrant workers to a single employer, represent a major step forward, but Amnesty said the proposed changes were at best a minor improvement.
Instead of tying a worker to the employer indefinitely, the proposed new law will limit the restriction to the length of the contract, which could be as long as five years.
And while campaigners and a report in May by the UN special rapporteur called for the abolition of the exit visa system that requires workers to seek the permission of their employer before leaving the country, Qatar instead proposed a new system that would give employers 72 hours to appeal against their departure.
Local media in Doha have reported that the new laws could be passed this year or early in 2015, but Amnesty said in their current form they would amount to a missed opportunity.
Were calling for something that substantively alters the power balance between worker and employer. Thats how well judge any progress on exit permits and kafala. These proposals dont do that, said James Lynch of Amnesty, who has extensively researched the issues in the region.
It is difficult to understand why more hasnt happened on these key, pressing issues. We dont think things are happening at the right speed, he said. It is six months since that announcement, but its a year since our report and its over a year since the Guardian investigation. Its four years since they won the right to host the World Cup.Lynch said it was important to maintain the pressure on world footballs governing body, Fifa. The decision to award the World Cup to the tiny emirate has come under huge scrutiny, with concern over temperatures that reach 50C in the summer and allegations of impropriety around the bidding process added to the human rights concerns.
We want nobody to be under any complacent view that this problem has been addressed. The same abuses are still happening, said Lynch.
This issue has been crying out for focus and urgent attention for some time. We really hope that in six months the picture will look better.
The Qatari government has pointed to an increase in the number of inspectors and Amnesty praises the more active stance taken by the Qatar Foundation and the 2022 supreme committee in policing standards among their own contractors.
But even among the organising committee that is building the stadiums for the World Cup, supposed to be setting a gold standard for others, malpractice remains. A Guardian investigation in July found that while construction workers building the stadiums were staying in purpose-built new accommodation blocks, they were still being paid only 45p an hour.
The Qataris insist that they serious about making progress and point to measures including the introduction of an electronic transfer system to ensure payment of wages on time and higher fines for illegally holding employees passports.
Since May, it has increased the number of workplace inspectors from 200 to 244, closed 33 unsafe worksites for breaching labour laws, increased the minimum mandated space required to house each worker by 50% and improved health and safety regulations.
Qatars sports minister, Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al-Ali, on Tuesday told Associated Press that it was making headway.
We understand this problem. For us, its a human question, he said, insisting that Qataris were not vicious people who are like vampires. We have emotions, we feel bad.
He added: It is something that really needs big, big work from us. But we are really tackling this problem face-to-face. We are not hiding."

Fifas ethics chief, Michael Garcia, this week reiterated his call for his report into the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes to be published in full. However in his first interview since succeeding his father, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani last year, the Emir dismissed concerns over corruption. People should understand that Qatar had the best bid, and Qatar will provide and will do one of the best World Cups in history and Im sure about that, he told CNN.
People dont want to accept, dont want to realise that a small country, Arab, Muslim country, can host a big event like that.
A Guardian investigation earlier this year revealed that hundreds of migrant workers have died in Qatar since construction of the World Cup stadia began, with the International Trade Union Confederation estimating 4,000 could be dead by the time the World Cup begins.
Yes, its true  we had problems, the Emir said. Were solving the problems. Were enforcing the laws  its not acceptable.
We changed the laws. They are enforced and there are many laws that have been changed. And Im telling you because I am personally hurt about the situation.
All the media is concentrating on Qatar due to the World Cup. If we have problems I dont mind talking about the problems. But also we need to talk other  about other things, about those laws that we did.
The players union FifPro and several major European leagues have voiced their concerns at the prospect of the World Cup being played in summer temperatures up to 45C, with Fifa due to decide in February whether to move the tournament to the winter months. However, the Emir insisted that hi-tech air conditioning systems could make it possible to hold the tournament in summer.
He said: We have this technology for ten years now and its working in one of our stadiums. One hundred per cent it will be working.
Our bid was for it to be in summer. At the end, its up to Fifa to decide when is the best time. Were ready for both."

The magazine published a statement on its website in which the author of the article, Martin Filler, said he regretted his error.
Hadid began proceedings for defamation against the magazine and Filler at Manhattan supreme court last week.
She claimed the article, a review of a book by Rowan Moore, the Observer's architecture critic, published in June, accused her of ""showing no concern"" for the deaths of hundreds of migrant construction workers in Qatar, where she has designed a football stadium for the 2022 World Cup. She is seeking damages, a halt to the review's continued publication and a retraction.
The planned location of the World Cup is controversial, not only for the sweltering temperatures in the bone-dry region but for the vast numbers of migrant workers killed on football-related construction projects there in the last two years, as revealed by the Guardian.
In the review Filler criticised comments made by Hadid in London in February on the topic of workers' deaths.
On Monday night, the editor of the New York Review of Books, Robert Silvers, released a statement to the Guardian and then posted it on the magazine's website. It was a letter of regret from Filler in the form of a note to his editors at the magazine.
It reads: ""To the Editors: In my review of Rowan Moore's Why We Build: Power and Desire in Architecture [NYR, 5 June], I quoted comments by the architect Zaha Hadid, who designed the Al Wakrah stadium in Qatar, when she was asked in London in February 2014 about revelations a week earlier in the Guardian that hundreds of migrant labourers had died while working on construction projects in Qatar.
""I wrote that an 'estimated one thousand laborers  have perished while constructing her project thus far'.
""However, work did not begin on the site for the Al Wakrah stadium, until two months after Ms Hadid made those comments; and construction is not scheduled to begin until 2015.
""There have been no worker deaths on the Al Wakrah project and Ms Hadid's comments about Qatar that I quoted in the review had nothing to do with the Al Wakrah site or any of her projects. I regret the error.""
Robert Silvers said the magazine was posting the statement on its website independently, not as a result of consultation with Hadid or her lawyers.
""We have done this entirely on our own. This letter contains the facts that should be made public and the regret that we thought was appropriate,"" he told the Guardian. He declined to discuss monetary damages. He said retractions at the magazine were ""very rare"".
He said Filler was out of town and not available for comment.
Hadid is being represented in her lawsuit by top New York-based lawyer Oren Warshavsky, well-known for his work on efforts to recover assets defrauded from clients by jailed pyramid-scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff.
Warshavsky issued a statement saying: ""The decision to file a lawsuit is never one made lightly. Ms Hadid carefully considered the issues at stake to her professional career and reputation and came to the conclusion that the filing of the lawsuit was the correct action to take.
""We are in receipt of Mr Filler's retraction issued today and aware of the New York Review of Books' plan to post it on their website. Ms Hadid together with counsel are reviewing it now and will respond after further careful consideration.""
Sources said no decision had been made about damages.
The magazine printed the retraction online under the article from Filler, called The Insolence of Architecture, which is only available to subscribers, and plans to put it on its home page and to publish it in the next print edition of the magazine due out on Thursday 28 August, on the letters page."

The award-winning architect filed a lawsuit in Manhattan supreme court last week, accusing the highbrow magazine and its architecture critic, Martin Filler, of defamation.
Her complaint centres on an article by Filler that was ostensibly a review of the book Why We Build by Rowan Moore, the Observer's architecture critic.
Filler took issue with comments Hadid made in London earlier this year when she said architects ""have nothing to do with the workers"" who have been dying in great numbers on ambitious building projects in Qatar following the controversial decision to allow the desert state to host the World Cup.
Hadid claims that passage was based on a February 2014 statement taken out of context, before work on the stadium had begun and that there were no worker deaths at the site. The topic had come up in a press conference she attended in London that followed an article in the Guardian revealing that almost 1,000 migrant workers, mainly from India and Nepal, had died on Qatar construction sites in the previous two years.
Despite Filler's article being about Moore's book, Hadid's lawyers point out that he repeatedly referred to Hadid in the article.
""Nearly all of those references are used to call our client's success into question or to characterise her personally as difficult. It is a personal attack disguised as a book review and has exposed Ms Hadid to public ridicule and contempt, depriving her of confidence and injuring her good name and reputation,"" said a statement from her New York lawyer Oren Warshavsky.
Warshavsky, a top US attorney and the lead lawyer to the trust trying to recover assets for clients defrauded by US financier Bernard Madoff, said construction was not due to begin on the football stadium designed by Hadid until 2015.
Hadid is seeking damages, a halt to the review's continued publication and a retraction.
Hadid, a dame of the British Empire, became the first female and first Muslim to win the most prestigious Pritzker Prize in architecture in 2004. She won the Stirling Prize in 2010 and 2011 and has featured on numerous media lists of the most influential people in the world.
Reuters reported last Thursday that Robert Silvers, editor of the New York Review of Books, said he was unaware of the complaint and declined to comment .
The lawsuit prompted comments both positive and negative on social media. ""Zaha strikes back!"" read one comment on Twitter. But she was also mocked on Twitter for suing the magazine and Filler.
Paul Goldberger, the former architecture critic of the New Yorker and former dean of the prestigious Parsons design college in New York, now a contributor to Vanity Fair, sent out a tweet saying that her lawsuit was unwise and would gain her a reputation as ""the architect who sues critics"".
He further tweeted: ""Zaha proves Goldberger's Law: the greater the success the thinner the skin."""

A Fifa spokesperson said it had ""repeatedly urged the Qatari authorities to address any unacceptable conditions for migrant workers in the country"" and that while Qatar's reforms of workers' welfare represent a significant step in the right direction it would monitoring implementation closely for ""concrete actions in the months ahead"".
""We are doing everything in our power to improve the welfare of migrant workers and to use the hosting of the 2022 Fifa World Cup as a catalyst for positive social change,"" the organisation said.
The pledge to scrutinise Qatar's committment to worker welfare from the Swiss-based body came as the wage rates paid to workers on the Al Wakrah stadium were attacked as ""deplorable"" and ""tainting football"" by a series of senior British politicians.
Payslips of workers labouring on the stadium in ferocious desert heat showed they earned as little as £4.90 a day.
Labour and Conservative figures criticised the salaries, which Nick Raynsford MP, Labour 's former construction minister, said were ""dreadful"".
He called on British firms operating in Qatar, especially those such as Zaha Hadid's architectural practice, to show Qatar how construction of such events should be carried out responsibly.
""Given the amount of money being spent on preparations for the World Cup in Qatar it is utterly deplorable that no one is taking responsibility for the gross exploitation of the workforce including shockingly low pay,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough for Fifa or international architects working on these projects to wash their hands and say it is not our problem.""
Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, said the revelations were ""utterly devastating for Fifa and Qatar 2022"".
""When abuse of workers was first unearthed, football authorities assured us there would be change,"" he said. ""But now we learn that the workers building world cup stadia  labourers the authorities have shown off as best practice  work for as little as 45p an hour. The exploitation has now entered the World Cup venues; the abuse is tainting football. This has to stop before the World Cup is permanently tarnished.""
Hugh Robertson, the former Conservative sports minister who oversaw England's failed bid for the 2018 World Cup in the same round that saw Qatar secure the 2022 tournament, said the low wages were ""clearly completely wrong"".
""It is grim, and if you are paying people 45p an hour it is absolutely right the spotlight of world opinion should be on you,"" he said. ""The ray of hope is that they have said they are going to do something about it.""
Qatar's World Cup organising committee has said: ""There are challenges with calculation of overtime pay and hours and we are working with the contractor to rectify any non-compliance."""

Jim Boyce, Britain's representative on Fifa's 24-person executive committee, said he was very concerned about the situation after repeated assurances from the organising committee that working conditions for World Cup workers would be safeguarded. ""If the supreme committee is now using offices built by these people, they should immediately take steps with the Qatar government to make sure they are properly paid for the work they have done,"" said Boyce.
The revelation that more than a dozen men who fitted out lavish offices in Qatar's football HQ have not been paid for up to 13 months came just days after Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, and its secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, met Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, to discuss World Cup preparations and ""the ongoing reforms of labour rights to ensure the welfare of migrant workers"".
The workers from Sri Lanka, India and Nepal worked on a £2.5m fitting of the 38th and 39th floor of the Bidda tower in Doha, which houses Qatar's supreme committee for delivery and legacy for the 2022 World Cup. The contractor, Lee Trading, was commissioned directly by the Qatar government, but failed to pay the workers, some of whom did not receive even modest salaries of £6 a day for more than a year.
They are now working illegally from cockroach-infested lodgings while the World Cup organising committee occupies the offices, sparking widespread concern.
""They should pay these workers,"" said Bert Schouwenburg, international officer of the GMB trade union. ""The Qatari government has buried its head in the sand for long enough. It is time to address the worst and most extreme exploitation of workers anywhere in the world that is now taking place right under its nose.""
In April, Jim Murphy, the shadow secretary of state for international development, met Hassan al-Thawadi, the chief executive of Qatar's World Cup organising committee, to discuss the kafala labour sponsorship systems that prevent workers changing jobs or leaving the country without permission from their employer. ""When I travelled to Doha, I met the Qatar 2022 organisers on the 37th floor of the Bidda tower,"" Murphy said. ""They made promises about workers and the reform of the kafala system. The news that the Bidda tower workers themselves haven't been paid makes those promises sound pretty empty.""
Amnesty International came across the workers last year, before the Guardian established they had worked on offices used by the World Cup organisers. Last November, the human rights campaign group raised their plight in person with Qatar's prime minister, interior minister and labour minister. It wrote to the ministry of labour asking for the men to be paid, allowed to leave the country or find new jobs.
Nicholas McGeehan, Human Rights Watch's Qatar researcher, said: ""If Qatar had announced some meaningful reforms, they would be able to defend themselves against these depressing revelations, because reforms need time to take effect in a sector beset by abuse and exploitation.  Qatar's inertia on labour reform should concern Fifa and their sponsors just as much as allegations of corruption in the bidding process."""

Unpaid for months and abandoned by their employer, they were struggling to buy food and unable to send money back home. The fact that they had been working on one of Qatars most prestigious towers, home to its main football bodies, added to the sense of injustice.
This should have been a simple case for the authorities to resolve. To my knowledge, no one involved in the case has denied that these men are owed months of unpaid salaries. And yet nine months later, cases languish in the courts and wages remain unpaid. Many of the men have returned home after giving up hope. Between the government, the courts and the companies involved, it appears the people who needed protection have largely been left to fend for themselves.
There will be immense frustration at these latest reports among those in Qatar, both Qatari and foreign nationals, who are trying to stop labour abuses. They are motivated by anger at the exploitation, waking up before dawn to launch surprise worker welfare checks on construction firms and working to build a business culture that respects rights.
They say they see signs of progress, including increased scope for public debate about workers rights, evidenced by the recent publication of a strongly worded report on the subject by the Qatar Foundation, one of the states most high-profile institutions, chaired by the mother of the emir. But these positive efforts are often overshadowed by grim accounts of those let down by the system because it seems some in the government havent grasped the scale and urgency of the challenge. Thats surprising, given the firestorm of the past year that has seen labour rights in Qatar discussed in the European parliament and at Fifa executive committee meetings, questions asked of the British prime minister and the US state departments decision to downgrade Qatars rating in its 2014 Trafficking in Persons report.
The labour ministry has made a raft of announcements in recent weeks, including increased and tougher labour inspection, stricter accommodation standards and wage protection measures, and proposals to marginally adjust the restrictive sponsorship system. But while there are some positive signs among this, much of it is just updates on the bureaucratic process; most of these laws have not come into force, let alone taken effect on the ground.
We are still waiting for the concrete steps that would begin to build confidence that there is a commitment to address the biggest issues: unambiguously and immediately abolishing the exit permit that prevents migrant workers from leaving the country without their employers permission; launching an independent investigation into the causes of workers deaths and developing plans to address these; dropping fees for workers to raise court cases against employers; prosecuting and publishing names of exploitative recruiters and employers; and granting domestic workers the legal protection of labour rights afforded to other workers. We also need to see a clear and ambitious timetable for full reform of the sponsorship system and how Qatar plans to provide migrant workers with their right to freedom of association.
These steps could start to win the country credit internationally and would largely be in line with what the states own review, produced by the law firm DLA Piper, has recommended. But the government seems unwilling or unable to stand up to influential parts of Qatars business community, who believe their interests lie in maintaining control of a cheap workforce and who have vigorously led opposition to full cancellation of the exit permit and substantive reform of the sponsorship system.
With controversy swirling around the countrys hosting of the World Cup, focused primarily on corruption allegations, the pressure has never been greater for the government and organisers to demonstrate to the world that Qatar 2022 can be a force for good. If they plan to answer their critics by doing the right thing on migrant labour, now is the moment."

helped build the 'tower of football',"Every night as Ram, Kamal and Krishna take off their boots outside their cramped rooms, they can see the shimmering silhouette of Qatars Aspire football complex.
Under its glowing domes, handpicked Qatari youths are drilled in preparation to play at the 2022 World Cup. The boys wear the latest £200 football boots and are trained by a former coach from Spains top league on a full-sized air-conditioned pitch sometimes used by Manchester United and Bayern Munich. In eight years time, these boys will carry the hopes of the richest per capita nation in the world in the opening match of footballs most prestigious event.
Aspire is just a couple of roads away from the lodgings where Ram and his friends live the other side of Qatars World Cup dream.
They came to Doha from impoverished parts of India, Nepal and Sri Lanka to help fit out a luxurious skyscraper overlooking the Persian Gulf. The Al Bidda Tower is a twisting vortex of glass that has thrust up alongside the gas company HQs whose vast revenues are bankrolling Qatars $200bn pre-World Cup building bonanza.
Dubbed the tower of football, it is dominated by the headquarters of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy  the powerful but scandal-hit government body tasked with organising the 2022 World Cup.
The men built a sleek white interior for the 38th and 39th storeys, which are now occupied by some of the supreme committees executives. No expense was spared by the royal clients. They fitted handmade Italian furniture, bespoke etched glass panelling and a state-of-the-art toilet that washes, dries and has a heated seat. They were supposed to be on modest wages - about £150 a month according to the terms with their employer, Lee Trading and Contracting - but have not been paid for months of labour and in some cases more than a year. They are sliding ever deeper into poverty. Families back home have had to take out high-interest loans to survive.
At nightfall Ram and the others finish their current black-market 50p-per-hour jobs, but instead of returning to one of the labour camps where most of Qatars 1.4 million migrant workers live, their minibus turns into a street of villas, an area where migrant workers are banned from living under Qatari law. This is their secret lodging house, where they have been trying to avoid detection by the Qatari police since Lee Trading collapsed and left them without vital permits.
Thirty-two men are squeezed into cockroach-infested bedrooms that are crammed with bunkbeds screened off only by towels. Food is kept in grout tubs on the floor, bathrooms are filthy and the tiles are ingrained with dirt. A stray cat toys with a piece of okra in the hall.
After they have washed and cooked they slump on to thin, dirty mattresses and explain how Qatars World Cup dream has turned them into victims of a kind of modern-day slavery.
Ram, 26, from Nepal says he has been to the labour court about 15 times in a vain attempt to get their missing money. Each time it costs two days wages to get there and back but there has been no progress. He is intensely frustrated, cannot afford to travel to the court and is ready to give up.
We are in very big trouble so I want to say to workers not to repeat our mistakes, he says. The government, the company: just provide the money. I am not angry with the spending of money by Qatar to bring the World Cup but we just expect our salary.
Krishna, also from Nepal, has not been paid for any work for more than a year on the Al Bidda project. I feel very bad about it, but thats obvious, he says. I was working very hard but at the end of the day I didnt get anything. Now we work illegally. It is very dangerous. If the CID come and we have no ID then they put us in jail.
This has already happened to five of his colleagues. He says some of the workers are owed 11 months salary, others 13 months and adds that there has been no official help for them.
Qatars prime minister was specifically told about their plight when Amnesty International complained about the Al Bidda workers back in December. But nothing has happened for these men.
We dont have any way to get justice, says Sri Lankan builder Kamal Nathan, 46. Human rights groups came but still six months on there is no progress. It is a waste of our time, our health, our money.
A statement from Qatars 2022 World Cup organising committee says it did not commission Lee Trading and has been using the offices temporarily. It says it is heavily dismayed to learn of the behaviour of Lee Trading with regard to the timely payment of its workers and will continue to press for a speedy and fair conclusion to all cases.
Unlike almost anywhere else in the world, the workers cannot legally take their labour anywhere else without permission from their employer. Making things worse, their passports have been taken from them and in any event under the Qatari system of labour sponsorship known as kafala, they can only leave the country with the permission of their employer or sponsor.
This was not just any project. Contract documents obtained by the Guardian show the fit out was commissioned by Katara Projects, a Qatari state entity under the auspices of the then heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim, who is now emir. The project director was Hilal Jeham al-Kuwari, the president of the Aspire Zone Foundation, the royal familys elite sports foundation and also chairman of Katara. A spokesman for Aspire said the offices were intended for Katara.
I went on site once and they didnt even have water and they were working in 55C heat because there was no air conditioning, the source says. My pay was delayed at one point and they did something about it because I was a westerner.
In November 2013, Amnesty International raised the case in person with the prime minister and interior minister of Qatar and later wrote to the ministry of labour asking officials to ensure the men received the salaries they were due, and to allow them to leave the country or find new jobs.
It is deeply depressing that these men have still not received the wages they worked for and are living in appalling conditions many months after we brought their plight to the governments and the clients attention, says James Lynch, researcher at Amnesty. They have seemingly been abandoned. This case highlights the deep-rooted problems with Qatars sponsorship system and the inability of the court system to effectively deliver justice to migrant workers.
Katara said it terminated the agreement with Lee Trading when it found out about the mistreatment of workers and it reported the managing director ,Lim Ah Lee, and his Qatari partner, Khalid Al Hail, to the labour ministry for non-payment of wages.Every effort was made to repatriate the workers involved on the Al Bidda Tower project or transfer them to new employers. If there are employees who were not repatriated, did not find employment or did not receive compensation, we would be happy to engage in any effort with the ministry of labour and ministry of interior to rectify the situation.
The Al Bidda workers predicament is far from unique. Despite recent assurances by the government that it will reform its labour system and remove the power that employers have over their workers, the Gulf states extraordinary ambition is still being enabled by exploitation and forced labour of some of the worlds poorest people.
The story repeats itself. Men from the poorest countries of the world are offered jobs at low but acceptable wages only to find, on arrival in Qatar, their pay slashed and then stopped altogether. The excuses come: the subcontractor hasnt been paid; the money will come by Monday, but the pay does not arrive. Employers seize the workers passports and the only body that can issue a permit for a worker to leave Qatar is the employer himself. Changing jobs is equally impossible: according to Qatari law employers must issue a non-objection certificate.
It is modern slavery enforced not through shackles and whips, but by fiddled contracts, missing permits and paperwork and the Guardian has found it happening just down the road from the desert palace of Qatars emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Khalifa al-Thani.
The turn off the eight-lane Dukhan highway, just 20 minutes west from the vast royal desert palace compound, into Shahaniyah camp is a transition to a scene redolent of one of the poorest parts of south Asia. The road becomes a rocky track, street lights disappear and men in lunghis weave through the shadows past rubbish-filled gullies.
This is where 25-year-old Nepalese father-of-two Ujjwal Bishwakarma lives in squalor with colleagues who work six or seven days a week building car showrooms, apartments and supermarkets. Inside the low-slung concrete blocks, eight men sleep to a room. They work for a theoretical wage of around £8 a day. But 65 of them say they have not been paid for any of the work they have done since January by their employer, Ibex Contracting and Trading.
There are no showers. Instead men wash in broken and filthy squat toilet cubicles. The cisterns are not even connected to the water supply, bins overflow, the washing water is salty and the drinking water filter is only changed once in five months, workers say, causing stomach upsets. They cant afford medicine and their employer has not provided medical cards granting access to free care.
Ujjwal left the Sindhuli district of central Nepal last autumn shortly before the birth of his second child, Milo, whom he has never seen. Without his remittances, his family has been forced to take a £660 loan from a private lender charging 48% interest a year. Every day he remains unpaid, the debt is mounting. His employer has taken his passport and he cannot move jobs because of Qatars labour laws.
Theres nobody else to look after my family so they had to take the loan, he says. We have questioned [the company] time and again. In the past two months the company keeps on extending the date of providing salaries. They have extended the date four times so far. It is not good. Because the country is economically rich, the workers should be paid their fixed salaries. I am regretting coming to Qatar.
The immigration document of another worker, Shanbu, which was stamped by the Nepalese government on 11 October 2013 before departure, shows he had agreed terms with Ibex to be employed as a foreman on a basic salary of £410 a month. But the contract signed with the employer on arrival was for £150 a month to work as a carpenter  a 64% cut. The men have been running up huge debts at the local grocery store.
I am not happy, Shanbu says. My family members are asking me to come back if there is no good work [in Qatar] and apply for other countries. I am regretting [coming] now. The money I am earning here could have earned in Nepal.
Reached by phone, the Ibex manager, Srikanth, explains: My problem here is I signed a contract for 15m [rial, £2.4m] and I was supposed to receive my advances during March but it was delayed. I am expecting the payment at any moment.
He says he will pay off their grocery debts and promises to pay the backdated wages within days, but when the Guardian checks, the money has not arrived.As far as my company is concerned I would never put people in this unfortunate situation but the market condition is like this, he says. I cannot escape from the market.
In recent days the Guardian has contacted him again, to be told the workers were owed three months salary, not five, and that two months of that have now been cleared. But Ujjwal Bishwakarma, one of the workers, says their last payment was for April.
Srikanth says the water for drinking and cooking has been addressed by regularly filling the water tank full of sweet water, adding that new coolers have been provided with a double filter.
He says Ibex has started regularising the medical card issues and that in the meantime if anybody is unwell the firm provides treatment through a private clinic. He will not comment on the large discrepancy in wages on Shanbus contract signed in Nepal and the one signed in Qatar.
His recruitment agent in Kathmandu, Capital International Manpower, said Shanbu was over-reacting and that they sent him on a foremans contract because that is the permit that had been supplied by Qatar. He is not [a] foreman, he is [a] mason, the agency said. He should think about his ability first and then only he can make [an] issue [out of the double contract].
Old Tata buses rattle along Dohas highways as the sun goes down, taking exhausted workers on the long drive back to their camps. On a bus pulling out of Lusail City, a new town north of Doha where a new stadium will be built to host the 2022 World Cup final, workers peel off headscarves and masks. Some rest their foreheads on their arms to sleep and let the evening air blow through the windows to cool them down. Others fish out mobile phones and click on to Facebook or text home to Chennai, Kathmandu, Fujian or Cebu.
Above the din of the engines, talk turns to how injury and sometimes death has become part of life on Qatars building sites.
Umesh Rai, a Nepalese plumber who has spent three years in Qatar, tells of several accidents even though he says his employer provided proper safety equipment.Six or seven months back there was an accident, he says. Some heavy object fell down and hit a person on the ground. And another case was four months back when scaffolding fell and hit a mans head, smashing his helmet.
There have been other confirmed accidents involving other contractors. Midmac, a major contractor working at Lusail, said a Filipino trainee driver was crushed to death by a truck in a stock area last year. The truck went forward and ran over the guy, says Clark White, the companys health and safety manager. From the finding of the client everything was in place safety-wise.
The firm has also confirmed another incident where about 17 workers were injured when a huge steel cage moved unexpectedly and trapped workers. It says the injuries were not serious.
The packed trauma unit at Hamad hospital provides a snapshot of the routine problems workers face. It is a high-quality facility: the main entrance evokes a five-star hotel and migrant workers have free healthcare if they have a medical card. But there are 70 workers in the packed trauma waiting room, some having collapsed unconscious or vomiting because of the heat, others with head injuries. One grimacing worker is helped in bow-legged, clutching his groin.
Outside, construction workers shelter from the sun under trees waiting for their colleagues to be treated but are shooed away by a Qatari official.
One of the great mysteries is why so many young fit men are dying from what the hospital authorities describe as sudden cardiac death. In 2012 and 2013, 500 men from India, Sri Lanka and Nepal died like this. Whether it is caused by exhaustion, heat or something else remains unclear because the Qatari health authorities do not routinely carry out autopsies.
One such case was Rishi Kumar Kandel, 42, who flew out to Qatar from Nepal in February. Within five months his coffin had arrived back at Kathmandu airport. He had died suddenly in his labour camp bed after a hot days work on 23 May.Kandel had borrowed money at 24% a year to pay the £500 agent costs but by the time he died he had only managed to send £170 back home. The company that employed him says it wont pay compensation because he died of natural causes.
Back in Nepal his wife, Saraswati, has to face up to the debt as well as her grief. No one should go to Qatar, she says. I dont want what has happened to me to happen to any of the other wives, sisters or mothers. Nepali workers go to Qatar to work  so [the Qatari government] should also do something for us; maybe pay back our loans and other necessary things.
She says her husband was hardly ever paid by his employer, and didnt get the job or salary he was promised. He had been complaining of heat and headaches before he died. His death certificate says he died from acute heart failure due to natural causes.
The Nepalese government says 366 Nepalese died of heart failure between mid-2006 and April 2014 in Qatar; in neighbouring Saudi Arabia in the same period only 28 died of heart failure. This anomaly was acknowledged in the recently published report on the condition of migrant workers in Qatar by the law firm DLA Piper. The report called for an independent study to investigate migrant workers deaths by cardiac arrest amid theories that heat and exhaustion may play a role.
The room where Kandel slept in a labour camp on the outskirts of Doha, has now been abandoned by his former roommates because they are scared of what happened to him. Theres a fear factor, says Jitendra Chaudhary, a worker in the camp. We worry that others might die. We all slept together after having dinner at around 10.30pm, but he didnt wake up in the morning. He came from duty, ate dinner and slept. Our work starts at 4.45am. At that time we tried to wake Rishi up  but, he didnt wake up. He was not sick. He used to work perfectly and was healthy.
Migrant workers punishing daily schedule is only broken on Friday afternoons when work stops, for most at least. In Saliya, the main industrial area, the temperature is in the mid 40s and the young men slip on their cleanest T-shirts and mill around the camps. Some carrying prayer mats dash to a makeshift mosque built from site huts. Others venture into central Doha where they gather on street corners to meet old friends from home. With migrant domestic workers also having the afternoon off, it is a rare chance to mix with women. It is also the moment a secret union meets.
Unions are banned in Qatar but in a room above a shabby Indian restaurant in Doha, 15 Nepalese workers rearranged the tables and chairs for a totally illegal support group meeting. At one end of the table are the veterans with eight years experience in Doha; at the other are fresh-faced new arrivals.
The men raise a closed fist salute, the international symbol of solidarity, and begin. Topping the agenda is the recent announcement from the Qatari government of plans to reform the labour laws  an attempt by the authorities to address the appalling conditions workers face.
We think they are only changing the terminology and not the sponsorship system, the agent system and the situation with passports and ID cards, says one member. Because if they really do change the rules it will slow down construction.
Another says: In fact it is getting worse than before because companies are anticipating the changes to the labour laws and so are making workers sign five-year instead of two-year agreements. Before, if we complete two years we can change companies; now we have to wait five years. Only yesterday they forced me to sign a five-year contract.
One man says that during his spell in Qatar his wage has risen 7% while the cost of his food has doubled.
With 400,000 Nepalese, 500,000 Indians and 130,000 Bangladeshis toiling in Qatar, there are large blocks of workers on whom the emir relies to maintain his kingdoms momentum. But the imbalance of power between workers and bosses is sometimes staggering.
Employers are supposed to pay compensation of around £40,000 to the families of dead workers but the Guardian was told of one case in which the workmates of a dead Nepalese labourer clubbed together to make a payment themselves because they feared their boss would sack them all if forced to pay up.
The governments of the migrants home countries also have to calculate the cost and benefit of lobbying for a better deal for workers. Qatar provides importance remittance income  migrant workers sent $13.5bn home from Qatar in 2012, according to Qatar Central Bank.
Sometimes the problem is a simple lack of diplomats. Nepal doesnt even have an ambassador in place. Maya Kumari Sharma was recalled last September having called Qatar an ""open jail"". The skeleton staff of five diplomats are overwhelmed by the problems of scores of labourers who turn up at its door each day. Qatari officials can be dismissive of complaints and often do not respond.
Everywhere you look workers appear trapped by the states contradictory attitude towards the role of the market in fuelling its development. The slovenly accommodation, low, late and missing pay, and unsafe workplaces all result in part from the freewheeling market economics Qatar encourages in the construction sector.
Contractors tussle to drive down prices and often must fight for payment themselves, even from fabulously rich Qatari clients. Yet workers are gripped in a vice of state control through the kafala system.
The ministry of labour said last month it had punished 200 companies in the first quarter of 2014 for labour law violations after inspections on 3,485 work sites targeting safety. It said it was launching a wage protection system involving workers being paid through trackable transactions to banks or exchange houses and is building hospitals exclusively for migrant workers.
But in the same month, Qatar abstained in an International Labour Organisation vote in favour of a protocol against forced labour that includes protection measures for migrant workers during recruitment and employment, including the obligation on employers to pay compensation and to face sanctions.
For many the trouble starts as soon as they find themselves in the sleek arrivals lounge of Hamad international airport  a stunning new building which sets new global standards in passenger convenience and service. Every day dozens of migrants are left stranded by employers who fail to collect them.
Mukhtar Bax, 32, has flown in from Nepal with three friends to start a new life as a labourer, expecting a wage of £7.70 a day. For 12 hours, from 10pm to 10am he has been waiting to be picked up. The driver for the company said he is going to have breakfast and them come and pick us up, he says. But we havent eaten anything.
Further down the seating area are Haroon Ali and Nazhir Hussain Sheikh. Ali says he is happy and excited, but his friend is tense and sad. After many hours their company boss has still not arrived.
Another Nepalese man shows off his migration paperwork from his government. A footnote reads: Best of luck for your bright future.""
For some, the deal is working. Money is being saved and sent home. For others, it is hard not to conclude their lives have been reduced to expendable commodities in a building boom where site hoardings proclaim with no hint of irony: Qatar deserves the best."

Officials in Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy have been using offices on the 38th and 39th floors of Doha's landmark al-Bidda skyscraper  known as the Tower of Football  which were fitted out by men from Nepal, Sri Lanka and India who say they have not been paid for up to 13 months' work.
The project, a Guardian investigation shows, was directly commissioned by the Qatar government and the workers' plight is set to raise fresh doubts over the autocratic emirate's commitment to labour rights as construction starts this year on five new stadiums for the World Cup.
The offices, which cost £2.5m to fit, feature expensive etched glass, handmade Italian furniture, and even a heated executive toilet, project sources said. Yet some of the workers have not been paid, despite complaining to the Qatari authorities months ago and being owed wages as modest as £6 a day.
By the end of this year, several hundred thousand extra migrant workers from some of the world's poorest countries are scheduled to have travelled to Qatar to build World Cup facilities and infrastructure. The acceleration in the building programme comes amid international concern over a rising death toll among migrant workers and the use of forced labour.
""We don't know how much they are spending on the World Cup, but we just need our salary,"" said one worker who had lost a year's pay on the project. ""We were working, but not getting the salary. The government, the company: just provide the money.""
The migrants are squeezed seven to a room, sleeping on thin, dirty mattresses on the floor and on bunk beds, in breach of Qatar's own labour standards. They live in constant fear of imprisonment because they have been left without paperwork after the contractor on the project, Lee Trading and Contracting, collapsed. They say they are now being exploited on wages as low as 50p an hour.
Their case was raised with Qatar's prime minister by Amnesty International last November, but the workers have said 13 of them remain stranded in Qatar. Despite having done nothing wrong, five have even been arrested and imprisoned by Qatari police because they did not have ID papers. Legal claims lodged against the former employer at the labour court in November have proved fruitless. They are so poor they can no longer afford the taxi to court to pursue their cases, they say.
A 35-year-old Nepalese worker and father of three who ssaid he too had lost a year's pay: ""If I had money to buy a ticket, I would go home.""
Qatar's World Cup organising committee confirmed that it had been granted use of temporary offices on the floors fitted out by the unpaid workers. It said it was ""heavily dismayed to learn of the behaviour of Lee Trading with regard to the timely payment of its workers"". The committee stressed it did not commission the firm. ""We strongly disapprove and will continue to press for a speedy and fair conclusion to all cases,"" it said.
Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, said the revelation added to the pressure on the World Cup organising committeeafter . ""They work out of this building, but so far they can't even deliver justice for the men who toiled at their own HQ,"" he said.
Sharan Burrow, secretary general of the International Trade Union Confederation, said the workers' treatment was criminal. ""It is an appalling abuse of fundamental rights, yet there is no concern from the Qatar government unless they are found out,"" she said. ""In any other country you could prosecute this behaviour.""
Contracts show the project was commissioned by Katara Projects, a Qatar government organisation under the auspices of the office of the then heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who is now the emir. He also heads the supreme committee, the World Cup organising body. The committee is spending at least £4bn building new stadiums for the tournament, which has become mired in allegations of bribery, while there is disbelief at the prospect of playing the tournament in Qatar's 50C summer heat.
Katara said it terminated its agreement with Lee Trading when it discovered the mistreatment of workers and non-payment of wages, and made efforts to repatriate those affected or find them new jobs. It said several workers had been compensated after court settlements. ""If there are employees who were not repatriated, did not find employment or did not receive compensation, we would be happy to engage in any effort with the ministry of labour and ministry of interior to rectify the situation,"" a spokesman said.
The problems at the Tower of Football workers are not isolated, despite Qatar's pledges to monitor salary payments and abolish the kafala sponsorship system, which stops migrant workers changing job or leaving Qatar without their employer's consent. In 2012 and 2013, 70 labourers from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka died from falls or strikes by objects, 144 died in traffic accidents and 56 killed themselves, the government's own figures show. Dozens more young migrant workers die mysteriously in their sleep from suspected heart attacks every summer.
The Guardian discovered more projects where salaries had not been paid. They included a desert camp of 65 workers who had not been paid for several months, were sleeping eight to a room, and were living with dirty drinking water, filthy, unplumbed toilets and no showers.
Another group said they were being paid only sporadically, that there was sometimes no water in their housing and no electricity to power air conditioning.
This month, the Qatar Foundation, a state body, published a report examining trafficking, debt bondage and forced labour among migrant workers. It identified practices that contravene International Labour Organisation conventions on forced labour and UN anti-trafficking protocols, ""widespread"" non-payment of wages and bribery and extortion among recruitment agents and employers.
From January to May this year 87 Nepalese workers died in Qatar, a death rate two-and-a-half times higher than that of British ex, pats, new figures from the Nepal government reveal.
""We know there is much more to do,"" said Abdullah al-Khulaifi, Qatar's minister of labour and social affairs in a statement detailing progress on labour law reforms. ""But we are making definite progress and are determined to build momentum."""

Individually, they may feel they can plot a path through all three.
A process is already in train that would see the tournament move to November and December, despite complaints from European professional leagues and US broadcasters, by the end of the year.
Realising that the constant stream of negative stories over the mistreatment of migrant workers was a PR disaster, the government recently made vague pledges to reform the kafala sponsorship system at its root.
And in trying to see off the latest challenge from the Sunday Times, it will employ the finest lawyers money can buy and continue to cling to the claim that Mohamed bin Hammam, the Qatari former Fifa vice-president who was banned for life over bribery claims after taking on Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency, was entirely separate from the bid.
On each of those, the Qataris might be able to hold the line individually. But together, they may be hard to sustain  especially in the knowledge that there are still seven years to go. Holding on to the prize that has so far proved more of a poisoned chalice relies on convincing Blatter that it would be more trouble to wrestle it from them than to stick with them.
The fact that it may be hard to rerun the 2022 vote without also reopening the 2018 bid, amid little appetite to take on Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, may also play in Qatar's favour. But if the odds on a sensational rerunning of the vote were long a year ago, they are shortening all the time.
Given the pile-up of problems facing the Qatar World Cup, the previously unthinkable step of running the vote again is now being discussed openly in Fifa circles.
Much depends on the verdict of Michael Garcia, the former New York district attorney who has spent the past 18 months investigating claims of corruption during the controversial and confusing dual bidding process. He has travelled the world talking to witnesses, including those from the English FA, and has now promised to deliver his report within seven weeks. However, it does not appear he will consider the evidence collated by the Sunday Times.
Depending on those findings, Blatter could conclude that the entire Qatar project is more trouble than it is worth and strip it of the tournament using Fifa's backstop powers as football's ultimate governing body.
It would be difficult to use the extreme heat as a pretext, given that Fifa has argued extensively that it has the right to move the tournament to winter.
But if Garcia has turned up clear evidence of illicit payments that affected the final vote, that would give Blatter the ammunition to call for a revote, if he decided such a move was in his best interests. The legal fallout would be sizable but it would allow the 78-year-old Fifa president, who did not vote for Qatar and favoured the US for 2022, to claim he had solved the problem, in advance of another run at the presidency in 2015.
There is little appetite within the president's office or Fifa more widely to challenge Putin's grip on the 2018 tournament, part of a double act with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics that he hoped would showcase Russia's strength to the world.
The focus on 2022 has meant comparatively little scrutiny of the 2018 race, in which England garnered just a solitary vote, although the rumour mill surrounding the Russian bid was just as febrile as others.
Garcia has also been examining the 2018 race but is unlikely to have uncovered conclusive proof of direct bribes to individual executive committee members. Just four years out, and in the wake of the troubled preparations for the Brazil tournament, there is little appetite to find a new host for the 2018 tournament. That may play into the Qataris' hands given the linked nature of the bid processes and the sense that it may be hard to rerun one without re-examining the other.
Despite saying that his current term as president would be his last, after standing unopposed in a hugely controversial election in 2011 following his rival Bin Hammam's demise in a blizzard of bribery allegations, Blatter has vowed to go on and on.
At Fifa's congress next week, Blatter will announce that he is standing for a fifth term as president next year, when he will be 79.
He recently claimed his ""mission"" was not yet complete and the sense in which he controls the weather within the bizarre and often opaque ecosystem of Fifa patronage is, if anything, stronger than ever. One by one, he has seen off the likes of Jack Warner, Chuck Blazer and Bin Hammam  one-time allies who either became too toxic or too much of a threat.
Once cast out of Fifa House they have largely maintained the code of omertà that is characteristic of the organisation. Blatter has remained as the last man standing, slowly undermining the case of his prospective rival, Michel Platini. That Platini, the Uefa president, has been closely linked with the Qatar bid has not gone unnoticed and Blatter continues to drop not-so-subtle reminders.
Despite his rock-bottom reputation in some parts of the world, his support base within Fifa's 209 members remains strong  partly as a result of the riches and patronage the development programme he helped to devise has bestowed upon them.
While many have called for a fundamental overhaul of the organisation to improve transparency and introduce corporate governance standards that have now become the norm elsewhere in business and the public sector, Blatter, who refers to himself as the ""captain"" of the listing ship, has only conceded limited reform.
Mark Pieth, brought in to chair an independent governance committee, recently ended his tenure in frustration. His final report listed seven recommendations, including a central ""fit and proper"" test for all executive committee members and the introduction of term limits, which had not been implemented by Blatter.
While there is broad agreement that Fifa needs to be reformed, the means for doing so are less obvious. Without concerted political pressure, it is likely Blatter will be able to continue to run the organisation according to his will. And while he remains at the helm, it is difficult to see how Fifa's reputation in the eyes of the world can begin to be rehabilitated."

report commissioned by Qatar into its treatment of migrant workers produced more than 60 suggested reforms  and one telling confirmation: that hundreds of migrants have died, many of them from unexplained sudden illness, over the past two years, at a rate of more than one a day.
The report by the international law firm DLA Piper calls for changes to the much-criticised kafala system that ties workers to their employers. It also contains the Qatari government's own figure on the numbers of migrants who have died on its soil: 964 from Nepal, India and Bangladesh in 2012 and 2013. In all, 246 died from ""sudden cardiac death"" in 2012, the report said, 35 died in falls and 28 committed suicide. The number of deaths resulting from work-related injuries was low.
But the real purpose of the 135-page report, commissioned in the wake of Guardian revelations about appalling working conditions in Qatar, was to make recommendations for reform. The document was welcomed by human rights campaigners as a major step forward, particularly given early fears that DLA Piper's independence could be compromised by its work for Qatar-owned news network al-Jazeera.
But they also warned that its recommendations must be followed by action to a clear timetable and were disheartened that little reference was made to the report in Wednesday's announcement.
""The verdict from DLA Piper is clear. The sponsorship system is not fit for purpose and the exit permit isn't justifiable,"" said James Lynch of Amnesty International. ""Rather than rejigging and renaming the system, the government should commit now to genuine deep-rooted reform, and a wider programme of measures tackling access to justice, health and holding private sector accountable for abuses against migrant workers.""
The report made 62 recommendations across nine key areas:
The report recommends Qatar strengthens and enforces laws preventing recruitment agencies from charging fees. It urges the authorities to go further and prohibit employers from dealing with any foreign recruitment agencies in countries of origin that charge fees. This would attempt to deal with the middlemen that charge large fees and overpromise to impoverished workers, leaving them in debt from the off.
It also calls for a streamlined system of redress for mistreated workers, improved awareness of methods of reporting ill treatment, a review of the licensing of recruitment agencies and for unethical agencies to be blacklisted.
At the crux of the debate over how Qatar and its Gulf neighbours treat migrant workers, human rights groups have long called for the kafala system that ties workers to their employers to be abolished. Those calls have met resistance from those who claim it is culturally embedded.
The DLA Piper report calls for a ""wide ranging and comprehensive review"" of kafala with a view to abolishing or phasing out ""certain aspects"" of the system and prioritising freedom of movement and the rights of workers.
It recommends that the controversial exit visa system be radically reformed to allow migrant workers to leave the country as of right, unless there is ""compelling evidence"" to the contrary. Over time, it should be abolished altogether.
Existing laws forbidding the employers from confiscating passports, currently widely ignored, should be much better enforced with offending firms blacklisted.
Worker welfare standards, such as those introduced in February by the Qatar 2022 football World Cup organisers, should be made mandatory in all contracts issued by public authorities  a move that would immediately raise the bar on many of the large infrastructure projects.
Crucially, the report recommends that lead contractors should be made responsible for compliance throughout their web of sub-contractors, where mistreatment is rife. It also calls for better monitoring of worker's contracts and translation of those contracts into their home language. Like many of DLA Piper's recommendations, enforcement will come down to will and resource.
The report calls for consideration to be given to introducing a minimum wage and for employers who fail to pay wages on time to be disqualified from being a sponsor. Qatar recently announced a new system for the automatic payment of wages electronically, another recommendation in the report.
DLA Piper recommends urgent action to demonstrate the importance placed on health and safety by the Qatari authorities amid its dash to build a new nation.
It calls for contractors that breach standards to be blacklisted and for the introduction of stronger criminal sanctions, as well as joint liability for contractors (often major western firms) and their sub-contractors.
In addition to practical measures such as the introduction of electronic ID cards and health and safety education, it recommends a series of steps to establish how many workers die on construction sites.
DLA Piper ""strongly recommends"" the regular collection and reporting of statistics regarding work related injuries and deaths, to be published anonymously every six months.
In light of the apparently unusually high levels of heart attacks, it calls for an independent study into sudden cardiac arrests over the next three years and for there to be proper investigation into unexpected or sudden deaths.
Recommendations include a mandatory induction for new employees, a worker welfare officer on every site, better monitoring and inspection and better complaints procedures.
Qatar has claimed that the number and frequency of inspections has increased but DLA Piper says more needs to be done so that the labour inspections department can perform its task with ""sufficient coverage and rigour"". It wants better training for inspectors, more powers, more interpreters for worker interviews and more transparency.
As an ""interim measure"", the law firm says recently announced standards on worker welfare for the Qatar 2022 supreme committee should apply to all public contracts. It calls for greater transparency and says the ministry of labour should ""publish proposals allowing migrant workers the right to freedom of association and representation"". Where Qatar sees grounds for limiting those rights, it should say why.
DLA Piper recommends the abolition of fees for complainants, better access to online and physical resources from the labour ministry, interim payments and a fast-track procedure for certain categories of complaint.
This article was amended on 28 May 2014 to correct the subheading, which gave an incorrect total for the number of migrants who died from cardiac arrests, falls and suicides. A line was added to the article to say that the report found that the number of deaths relating from work-related injuries was low."

arrivals hall at Kathmandu airport. In departures, hundreds of thousands of young men were leaving their lives in Nepal to provide for their families as the human capital fuelling a multibillion-dollar construction boom in the neighbouring Gulf states. In arrivals, on a daily basis, some of their predecessors were being unloaded from the cargo hold in coffins.
This telltale sign that something was going very badly wrong for migrant workers led Guardian reporters on a months-long investigation that produced some chastening revelations for Qatar: workers, having paid fees to often unscrupulous middlemen, were facing horrendous conditions upon arrival in the emirate to work. Wages were often lower than billed, living quarters were often inhuman, working conditions were demanding at best, and outrageous, dangerous  and even fatal  at worst.
Many of the problems led back to the kafala system that ties migrant workers to their employers. Unable to leave the country without the permission of their sponsor, workers were often forced to accept lower wages and unsanitary, cramped and dangerous living conditions. Wages could be withheld for months. Case after case has been painstakingly documented by human rights organisations and the media.
Those more unlucky still ended up seriously injured and trapped in limbo in Qatars hospitals, abandoned by their employers, with passports and exit visas withheld, and with no insurance to pay for treatment. For others, their journey ended in a coffin being received by their shattered families in the arrivals hall.
Those from Nepal make up only one sixth of the migrant workers in Qatar alone. The numbers are mind-boggling: there are 1.4 million migrant workers in Qatar, making up around 94% of the overall population. The remaining 6% enjoy the highest GDP per capita of any country in the world. Yet it is the individual stories of human suffering that have brought the issue home and led a series of inspectors, from the International Labour Organisation to the United Nations, to demand change.
While respected human rights groups and trade unions had loudly raised the issue since Qatar was controversially awarded the World Cup in December 2010, there was little movement until the Guardian published the results of its investigation in September 2013.
Central to the investigation was the revelation that hundreds of migrant workers are dying in Qatar each year. The Guardian produced documentation detailing the deaths of Nepalese workers. The Qatari response was at turns conciliatory and defiant. A global outcry ensued.
Since then, human rights groups have urged the Qatari government to make a simple, clear statement of intent by abolishing the controversial exit visa system that gives employers ultimate power over their workers and prevents workers from leaving the country without consent.
Yet even more liberal forces within Qatar urge caution, fearing a backlash if conservative countrymen believe they are being bounced into action by the west. Frustration has grown as existing laws have not been implemented and discussion of new ones has been caught up in red tape.
Those governments sending hundreds of thousands of workers to Qatar, and even the NGOs in Nepal and elsewhere campaigning for change, are also conflicted  given the employment opportunities on offer for their people.
The other players notable for their silence have been the huge multinational construction firms that are profiting from Qatars construction boom.
Earlier this week, the French medal of honour was conferred on a senior Qatari official, Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah, by the president, François Hollande. Qatar has spent 15bn with French companies in the past five years alone.
The French former president Nicolas Sarkozy urged the Uefa president, Michel Platini, to vote for Qatar to host the World Cup, which he duly did. Platinis son is employed by a sportswear firm owned by a Qatar investment fund, although the Frenchman insists his decision to give the country his vote was his alone.
In Germany, Siemens has the $8.2bn contract to build the ambitious new metro system and many other firms have benefited. In Britain, a large number of construction firms and consultants have been engaged in a dash for contracts.
But insiders who attend a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills working group for those with interests in the region say the mistreatment of migrant workers is barely mentioned.
Since the scale of the problems faced by migrant workers became clear, the Foreign Office minister Hugh Robertson, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and the Prince of Wales have all travelled to the region and been received in Doha. And yet the focus has been very much on trade links rather than human rights.
On a wall in the towering office block where the Qatar 2022 supreme committee is based, an entire wall is given over to a series of drawings and plans representing the overall masterplan, from investment in transport infrastructure to the stadiums that must be constructed from scratch.
Drive through the often gridlocked traffic 10 miles out of Doha, past the virgin desert where the as-yet-unbuilt Lusail Iconic stadium is set to host the World Cup final in 2022, and you can see a scale model of an entire city that doesnt exist yet.
The planned $45bn city of Lusail, like many of the other infrastructure projects on which Qatar will spend £123bn over the next four years alone, is not happening solely because of the World Cup but is intrinsically related to it.
The bold and controversial World Cup bid is an integral part of the wider 2030 Vision, a project designed to position Qatar for the future and the day when the natural oil and gas reserves that are the source of its mind-boggling wealth might run dry.
For its part, Fifa has twisted in the wind. World footballs governing body, discredited by a string of corruption claims, first promised in 2011 to use the spotlight afforded by the World Cup to hold Qatar to promises of reform on the way migrant workers are treated.
Following disturbing reports from human rights organisations such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, as well as the strident campaigning of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), Fifas secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, promised to hold Qatar to account.
As the world governing body of the most popular sport we have a responsibility that goes beyond the development of football and the organisation of our competitions, he said then.
But little was done and the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, was only forced to confront the issue again after the outcry that followed the Guardians reports. In typical fashion, Blatter has told each audience what they want to hear  he has travelled to the Gulf to reassure and offer warm words, while employing the Fifa executive committee member Theo Zwanziger to talk tough and engage with the ITUC.
Fifa has insisted in statement after statement that the situation for migrant workers on the ground must improve. In a recent letter to the shadow international development secretary, Jim Murphy, Valcke again promised it was committed to assuming its role and responsibility  so that the situation of migrant workers in Qatar and their labour rights is addressed with the necessary urgency considering the seriousness of the matter.
But in his most recent comments Blatter appeared to wash his hands of the issue. They have a problem and we know that, but this is not a question for Fifa,"" he said in Hong Kong last week. It is one which the state of Qatar must handle, as well as all the construction companies who are responsible for the workers.
Even now, too little is known about the fate of many of those who travel to Qatar and other Gulf states, already tied to their sponsoring employer by kafala, in debt to middlemen and unaware of the dire conditions in which they may be forced to work.
Thanks to investigative work by the media and human rights organisations, and disclosures from the Pravasi Nepali Coordination Committee (an NGO in Nepal) and the Indian embassy, we know now that more than 500 Indian migrant workers have died since January 2012 and more than 380 Nepalese workers died in 2012 and 2013.
There are an estimated 1.4 million migrant workers in Qatar. Those from India make up 22% of the total, with a similar proportion from Pakistan. About 16% are from Nepal, 13% from Iran, 11% from the Philippines, 8% from Egypt and 8% from Sri Lanka.
Not only do we not know how many migrant workers have died from those other countries, too little is known about how those from Nepal and India were killed. Latest figures obtained by the Guardian show that another 53 Nepalese people have died in Qatar this year, despite the call for action.
Detailed cause-of-death information seen by the Guardian shows that many of the Nepalese workers were killed by sudden heart attacks or in road accidents, as well as workplace accidents. Yet campaigners are convinced that many of those deaths recorded as sudden heart failure are caused by overwork, and some of those road accidents are a result of a failure of health and safety practices.
The impediments to change are both practical and philosophical. Human rights organisations who visit Doha regularly are cautiously optimistic about the extent to which senior figures in the Qatari administration are engaging with the issue. A DLA Piper report that looked like being an attempt to knock down the claims from the media and human rights groups seems to have become a serious attempt to grapple with the issue.
And whereas the previous response was to attack the messenger  the attorney general rounded on the Guardian after those initial reports  there now appears a genuine will to at least consider the problem. The World Cup supreme committee has led the way, introducing a new code of practice for the small number of workers employed directly on building the World Cup stadiums and pointed to increased inspections.
There have also been longstanding promises to reform the law regarding domestic workers, who are not covered by the existing legislation and can be subject to horrific exploitation and mistreatment, and there are some signs of progress. The publication of the DLA Piper report is expected to be accompanied by what have been described as significant changes to labour law. There is talk of expanding the workers charter that governs World Cup projects to all of those commissioned by the Qatar Foundation, which oversees billions of dollars of investment every year.
The report this month from the UN that called for an end to kafala also expressed hope that the World Cup, and the global attention to the issue it has brought, could be a catalyst for change.
But those campaigning for change on the ground are conflicted. Twelve months ago, they would have been pleased at this level of engagement at senior levels in Qatar. But given the global outcry that followed the initial reports, there will be bitter disappointment if they fail to secure meaningful reform. Meanwhile the position of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and those around him in his star chamber remains opaque.
The fear is that any proposed changes, watered down so as not to offend the more conservative forces in the country, will not prove sufficient to help those most in danger. Even then, there remains concern about how strictly changes will be enforced amid the dash to complete the unprecedented nation building programme given the fixed deadline of the 2022 World Cup.
Without fundamental reform of kafala, harsher penalties for those who transgress, the scrapping of the exit visa system, new rules to regulate recruitment agencies, much improved enforcement and a change in the culture of the companies employed to build a countrys infrastructure from scratch in record time, the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon.
Recent harrowing reports from the German national newspaper Die Welt and others show that the suffering continues on the ground. Meanwhile, the repatriation of bodies continues, with more than 60 workers from India and Nepal alone killed in Qatar in February and March this year."

of its controversial labour laws, in the wake of an international outcry over conditions for migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup, which followed a Guardian investigation into workplace abuse in the Gulf state.
Officials said they would replace the country's ""kafala"" sponsorship system, which tethers workers to a single employer, who can therefore treat his workforce with impunity, pending the approval of a draft law.
But human rights groups, which had hoped this would be a watershed moment, feared the lack of detailed proposals represented ""a missed opportunity to tackle the key issues"". Amnesty International said it suspected it amounted to a ""change of name rather than a reform to the system"".
One significant change is to make it less difficult  though not necessarily easy  for foreigners to leave the country and change jobs. However, altering the rules on ""exit visas"", which restrict a worker's ability to leave Qatar, and other reforms will have to be ratified by the shura (advisory) council, and businesspeople in Qatar are expected to oppose them vigorously.
""We are going to abolish the kafala system and it will move to the legislative institutions,"" said Colonel Abdullah Saqr al-Mohannadi, human rights director of the Qatari interior ministry. ""It will be replaced by a contractual relationship between employer and employee. We hope that the exit visa will be abolished completely.""
Under the new rules, a Qatari employer would have to show ""compelling"" proof of any objection to a worker leaving the country. Disputes would be resolved within three days. Other possible changes include mandatory employee welfare contracts, sanctions against employers who fail to meet their obligations, and closer bilateral regulatory links with the workers' countries of origin. Experts say tighter implementation across the board will be the key.
The reforms are based on recommendations by the London law firm DLA Piper, which was commissioned to review the legislative and enforcement framework of Qatari labour laws after the Guardian's investigative reports last autumn. The firm has had a 10-strong team working on the 140-page report for six months.
""This shows willing on the part of the highest levels of government, after a huge amount of international pressure, to reform the kafala system,"" said a western diplomat. ""There will be significant domestic pressure to water down these proposals. Still, things can happen quite quickly if they have the emir's full backing."" Sepp Blatter, president of Fifa, which awarded Qatar the 2022 World Cup, claimed it was a ""significant step in the right direction for sustainable change in the workers' welfare standards in Qatar"".
But Amnesty's James Lynch said: ""Promises to fully review sponsorship and exit permits in the long term don't help workers on the ground. The government has been announcing a law on domestic workers' rights since 2008 but we still haven't seen it.""
Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch said: ""The notion that the kafala system can be abolished by no longer referring to a 'sponsor' but an employer/employee relationship is utterly preposterous.""
Rima Kalush, at Migrant-Rights.Org, said the reforms unveiled amounted to ""an announcement of an announcement"". ""My worry is that Qatar will follow Bahrain's footsteps in renaming the sponsorship system without actually abolishing the majority of the exploitative laws and practices that encompass the system.""
More than 85% of the country's total population of 2.1 million are non-Qataris  the highest ratio of migrants to citizens in the world. The largest foreign community is about 500,000 Indians, with large contingents from Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Philippines. Qatar, with vast reserves of gas, is officially the world's richest country according to GDP per capita. Doha's many glittering new buildings and massive construction projects are concrete testimony to its immense wealth and ambition.But its construction boom has come at the expense of the safety and wellbeing of many thousands of migrant workers. Investigations by the Guardian, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have revealed cases of workers toiling for little pay in unsafe and insanitary conditions. Some have been prevented from leaving the country and others have had their wages withheld. Some end in a kafkaesque nightmare, on the run from the brutality of their official ""sponsor"", unable to work and so to subsist, unable to leave. Hundreds die.
The International Trade Union Confederation has warned that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022 if nothing is done to protect their rights.
The DLA Piper report carried confirmation from the Qataris that hundreds of migrants die in the emirate on construction projects each year. The government said 964 workers from Nepal, India and Bangladesh had died while living and working in the Gulf state in 2012 and 2013. A minority of the deaths happened on building sites; in 2012, 246 were recorded as ""sudden cardiac death""  the biggest killer among the largest groups of migrant workers in Qatar, according to statistics provided by the state's Supreme Council of Health.
Another 72 were killed in road traffic accidents, and 35 died in falls or by being struck by a ""thrown, projected or falling object"". In 2012, 28 workers killed themselves by ""hanging, strangulation and suffocation and intentional self-harm, by sharp object"", the classification states.
Doha still insists no workers have died on World Cup construction projects. Officials like to describe the 2022 Fifa soccer tournament as a ""catalyst for change"". But DLA Piper warned that increased transparency and communication were crucial.
Changes to the labour laws will be closely scrutinised. The exit visa requirement has already been abolished in the nearby UAE, another huge employer of foreign workers. But an ongoing review is not expected to include agreement to collective bargaining rights.
The fanfare surrounding Wednesday's announcement suggested the Qataris were keen to improve an image that has been tarnished by revelations about migrant labour deaths and conditions.The changes  officially described as ""far-reaching labour market reforms""  were announced at a joint ministry of interior and ministry of labour press conference in one of many Doha's luxury hotels, where journalists were welcomed with a groaning buffet before proceedings began. But the speakers were officials rather than ministers  suggesting a lack of confidence in the future of the reform programme.Still, foreigners involved in the migrant labour issue point to improved levels of cooperation. ""There's been a change of attitude by the Qataris,"" said one European legal expert. ""They have openly engaged with people. They have allowed themselves to be criticised in their own press. They have some good civil servants but like everyone else they also have some time servers. The scale of the issue is huge.""
Shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy, who recently travelled to Qatar, said: ""Today's announcement is a small step on a very long journey  and it is absolutely vital that the reforms promised today are implemented quickly and fully. But Fifa must insist that more is done. Football fans will be sickened if the industrial scale exploitation of workers is allowed to continue""
Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the ITUC, was more peremptory.
""Modern slavery will still exist in Qatar despite the announcement of cosmetic reforms to the labour law today. The changes are designed to make it easier for employers to find migrant workers, but the announcement fails to address the multiple violations of international labour standards found by the International Labour Organisation in March. The announcement was made by civil servants and the military, without a government minister present. It gives no guarantee for workers in Qatar.""
Further announcements about new legislation and reforms were promised ""in the coming months"".
This article was amended on 30 May 2014. The earlier version said ""Qatar has an expatriate community of 1.39 million people, which forms more than 85% of the country's total population of 2.1 million"". The figure of 1.39 million was given in DLA Piper's review as an estimate of the number of migrant workers in Qatar, but it is thought that there are around 300,000 Qatari citizens, which suggests the number of non-Qataris in the country is around 1.8 million."

Many of the 84 countries speaking at the UN Human Rights Council panel reviewing Qatar's human rights record called on the Gulf state to scrap its kafala sponsorship system that restricts each of its 1.4 million migrant workers to a single employer.
Several also linked Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup directly with the need for labour reform. Recent reports from the UN and the International Labour Organisation also called on Qatar to reform labour laws and step up enforcement.
""There are widespread reports of violations of the rights of migrant workers, especially in the context of preparations for the 2022 Fifa World Cup,"" the Ireland delegation told the panel.
Recommendations, which are not binding, included scrapping exit visas which can prevent immigrant workers leaving, and giving legal protection against what Belgium said was ""persistence of violence against women and girls"".
The UK delegation called for a clear timetable on scrapping the sponsorship system and for the introduction of new rules to protect domestic workers, who are not covered by existing labour law.
The main countries that supply migrant workers to Qatar, and are therefore dependent on the jobs provided by the construction boom in the country, were less critical. However, Indonesia, one of the main providers of domestic workers, called for new laws to protect them.
Spain led calls to ""strike from the books"" the kafala sponsorship system which gives employers complete control over their workers.
The Netherlands called on Qatar to make adequate labour conditions ""an important criterion for granting building contracts"" and to blacklist contractors who violated rules. The US also called for the kafala system to be scrapped.
The Qatari authorities recently took possession of a report from law firm DLA Piper that was commissioned in the wake of the global outcry that followed a series of Guardian reports on the treatment of migrant workers, and pressure from human rights organisations.
The International Trade Union Confederation has warned that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022 if nothing is done to protect their rights.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have detailed a string of cases where workers are toiling for little pay in unsafe and insanitary conditions. Some have been prevented from leaving the country and others had their wages withheld.
Changes to the labour law, based on the recommendations in the DLA Piper report, are expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks.
Delegates at the UN meeting also called on Qatar to improve women's rights, guarantee freedom of expression in the country and release Mohammad al-Ajami, a poet sentenced to 15 years for criticising the ruling Emir.
Qatar's assistant foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, said there had been ""some helpful recommendations from different countries.""
""We recognise that there are certain issues and challenges we are facing about the migrant workers,"" the minister told the Associated Press after the three-hour meeting. ""We think the World Cup is a catalyst for us to help us accelerate our performance.""
He added that the changes to the labour laws, which pressure groups hope will include a commitment to scrap the exit visa system, would be announced this month. ""We will come, I think, very soon within the current month with an overall work programme.""
The minister opened the panel meeting outlining progress made enacting recommendations, including measures to combat human trafficking and protecting women and children from domestic violence, since a previous four-yearly review in 2010."

On the day that the Qatari authorities confirmed they had received a pivotal independent report into workers' rights triggered by Guardian revelations of workplace abuses in the country, they on Thursday faced mounting calls to rapidly reform labour laws.
According to official figures, a total of 53 Nepalese workers died between January 2014 and mid-April this year, taking the toll on that country since January 2012 to more than 430. New figures from the Indian embassy show that 89 migrants died in the first four months of the year, bringing the total of Indian deaths to 567 since January 2012.
Analysis of previous death figures has shown that a high proportion were involved in workplace accidents or suffered sudden heart failure, though some may have died of natural causes and will not have been on building sites.
Qatari officials have stepped up inspections of working conditions and recently gave strong indications that they are prepared to reform labour laws, but it remains unclear whether they will go as far as scrapping an exit-visa system which prevents workers leaving Qatar without the permission of their employer. There are many examples of migrant workers being effectively held to ransom because their employer refuses to allow them to leave, with French footballer Zahir Belounis being a high-profile example.
The exit-visa system has become an important issue as rights bodies await the publication of an independent report by law firm DLA Piper that was commissioned in the wake of a global outcry prompted by a series of reports in the Guardian in September 2013.
The Qatari government confirmed they had received the ""comprehensive"" DLA Piper report into the health and safety migrant workers and its national labour laws. It said it was studying the conclusions and proposals for action, promising to publish it in full at a later date together with its response.
At a conference in Doha on Thursday attended by senior Qatari government representatives, Amnesty International's head of global issues, Audrey Gaughran, told them the exit-visa system was a ""blatant human rights violation"".
Human rights organisations believe Qatar has reached a crunch point at which it must make a decisive move to demonstrate its commitment to reform by scrapping exit visas.
""It would be evidence of good intentions and good faith. It's very much the low-hanging fruit in this debate. [The system] can be abolished without any impact on the profitability of commercial enterprises,"" said Nicholas McGeehan, the Human Rights Watch researcher for Bahrain, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates.
""We recognise that labour reform will be incremental. We see it as in Qatar's best interests to get rid of this system. It would demonstrate to the business community that labour reform and the ability to run commercial enterprises are not mutually exclusive. We hope someone invests some political capital in this and abolishes it.""
The minister of labour and social affairs, Abdullah Saleh Mubarak Al Khulaifi, told the Peninsula newspaper his ministry was making ""every effort"" to tackle all laws that relate to workers' issues. He reportedly announced a new system whereby workers would have to be paid by bank transfers, which can be monitored, instead of by cash, which is open to abuse.
""Our [Islamic] religion has ordered us to treat workers in a humane way, and not to task them with unbearable jobs  most importantly, to pay them,"" Khulaifi said. ""We hope that the wage protection system will achieve its aims.""
James Lynch, Amnesty's lead researcher for the Middle East, said after speaking at Thursday's conference that the Qataris were engaging with the complex issue but Amnesty now wanted to see concrete signs of progress.
""It is encouraging that the government turned out in force and the officials with relevant authority engaged in the debate,"" said Lynch.
""But we don't have any new information about what the plans are. There was some acknowledgement that there were issues to be addressed, but we didn't hear any positions particularly shifting.""
Workers from Nepal make up around a sixth of the 1.4 million migrant workers in Qatar fuelling a £123bn investment in infrastructure over the next four years, while just over a fifth come from India.
The oil and gas-rich Gulf state is embarking on an unprecedented ""nation-building programme"" of which the 2022 World Cup is an integral part. The International Trade Union Confederation has warned that 4,000 migrant workers could die before a ball is kicked if nothing is done to reform labour laws.
Pressure for better working conditions has increased since a Guardian investigation last year discovered that Nepali workers alone died at a rate of almost one a day last summer. The new figures from the Nepalese Foreign Employment Promotion Board are likely to be a conservative estimate, because they only record those families that approach it for compensation on behalf of the deceased.
Qatar has its UN universal periodic review session on 7 May  a process that takes place every four years in which a country's human rights record is reviewed by other states  and is expected to want to unveil some progress towards labour law reform before then.
Visiting MEPs and other inspectors have also been told to expect significant changes to the labour law, which could include a commitment to extend a new workers' charter applying to World Cup-related projects to all work commissioned by the government.
Jim Murphy, the shadow secretary for international development, said: ""The release of the DLA Piper report will be a step in the right direction, but the real test is the reform that comes with it. Fifa must insist on substantial change that dramatically improves the lot of migrant workers currently suffering in Qatar."""

In a report (pdf) by the special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, François Crépeau, the UN general assembly has added to the pressure on the Gulf state to fundamentally reform and properly enforce its labour laws.
Reports in the Guardian and by human rights groups have consistently warned of the exploitation and abuse of up to 1.2 million migrant workers, who are propping up a £123bn construction boom over the next four years.
The UN report found that exploitation was ""frequent"", confirming that migrants often worked without pay and ""live in substandard conditions"", and also called for changes to the recruitment process. Domestic workers, currently excluded from labour laws, and the majority of whom are women and girls, were ""extremely vulnerable to violence and abuse"" it said.
""The recruitment process for migrants needs to be further formalised in order to prevent exploitation, and legislation must be enforced in order to ensure their rights are respected. The kafala system, which links a work permit to a single employer, is a source of abuse and exploitation of migrants and should be abolished.""
Qatari officials have promised recent visiting delegations of MEPs and human rights groups that they are planning to introduce reforms, but are likely to stop short of abolishing the kafala system.
A report commissioned by the Qataris from the law firm DLA Piper, following the Guardian's original reports, is due to be published shortly.
Many workers arrive in Qatar heavily in debt, having paid huge sums to middlemen to secure contracts in the fast-growing Gulf state.
There are an estimated 1.2 million migrant workers in Qatar. Those from India make up 22% of the total, with a similar proportion from Pakistan. About 16% are from Nepal, 13% from Iran, 11% from the Philippines, 8% from Egypt and 8% from Sri Lanka.
Figures from the Nepalese and Indian embassies show that 36 workers died in Qatar in February, although not all of those death may have occurred on building sites. Data from the Indian embassy showed a further 26 Indian migrant workers died in March.
In February, the Guardian revealed that more than 500 Indian migrant workers had died in Qatar since January 2012 and more than 380 Nepalese had died in 2012 and 2013.
The Qatar World Cup organisers insist that by holding their contractors to higher standards, they can create momentum for change, and that improved rights for workers could be one legacy of hosting the tournament.
But the International Trade Union Confederation, which warns that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022 if Qatar does nothing to reform its laws, called the new workers' charter a ""sham"".
Last month, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) published a critical report and called on Qatar to make changes as international pressure builds.
The three-person ILO panel  comprising a government representative from China, an employee representative from the United Arab Emirates and a worker representative from Nepal  called on the Qatari government to ensure sufficient sanctions were imposed on the contractors and middlemen who exploit the kafala system.
Amid mounting concern, Fifa has belatedly urged Qatar to improve conditions for migrant workers, while at the same time claiming that it can do little to intervene.
""They have a problem and we know that, but this is not a question for Fifa,'' said the governing body's president, Sepp Blatter, in Hong Kong this week, in the face of protests against Qatar's treatment of migrant workers. ""It is one which the state of Qatar must handle as well as all the construction companies who are responsible for the workers.""
The UN report said the hosting of the World Cup could act as a catalyst for change, provided Qatar extended a new workers' charter introduced by the 2022 organising committee to all construction projects."

The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) said the ILO's criticism of Qatar  based on the findings of a three-person panel  was ""exceptionally strong"". The ITUC has claimed that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked at the 2022 World Cup finals.
Qatar is spending £123bn in the next four years alone on a major infrastructure construction drive, of which the 2022 World Cup is part. Authorities have said they are investigating claims of migrant deaths and abuse of workers' rights.
New figures from the Nepalese and Indian embassies showed that 36 workers died in Qatar in February this year, although not all of those may have been on building sites. Figures from the Indian embassy showed a further 26 Indian migrant workers died in March.
In February the Guardian revealed that more than 500 Indian migrant workers had died in Qatar since January 2012 and that more than 380 Nepalese had died in 2012 and 2013.
The ILO upheld a complaint from the ITUC and Building and Wood Workers International on the right of migrant workers to join a trade union and collectively bargain in Qatar.
""The ILO's criticism of Qatar is exceptionally strong, and confirms the appalling lack of even the most basic legal protections for Qatar's exploited migrant workforce,"" said the ITUC general secretary, Sharan Burrow. ""Qatar's rulers must end their system of modern slavery and accept that their outdated and repressive labour laws have to change.""
The three-person panel  comprising a government representative from China, an employee representative from the UAE and a worker representative from Nepal  called on the Qatari government to ensure sufficient sanctions were imposed on the contractors and middle men who exploit the kafala system.
A series of newspaper reports and studies by human rights organisations have shown that large numbers of the 1.4 million migrant workers in Qatar endure appalling conditions and that some are left effectively trapped in the country by the kafala system that ties them to their employers.
""The committee calls on the government to take effective measures to ensure that adequate sanctions are applied to employers who impose forced labour,"" said the ILO report. ""In this regard, it emphasises the importance of ensuring that law enforcement actors and the judiciary are adequately trained and sensitized on forced labour practices in the country, particularly as penalties play an essential role in the deterrence of forced labour practices.""
A delegation of MEPs who sit on the human rights committee of the European Parliament travelled to Qatar last week before a planned visit by the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter. Mario Dravid, chair of the committee, said he had been told by the prime minister, HE Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani, and other government representatives that Qatar was taking the problem seriously and planned changes to the kafala system.
""The delegation was informed that there will be a deep and comprehensive revision of the sponsorship system in the country,"" he said. ""The government is seriously thinking on this issue and we hope that it will take place sooner than later as migrant workers constitute 96% of the workforce in the country.""
A report commissioned by the Qatari government from the law firm DLA Piper in the wake of the Guardian's initial reports was due to be published by the end of March. MEPs were told last week that the report was imminent.
The ILO has given the Qatari government until November to report back on reforms to its labour laws."

Amid ongoing concern about the treatment of those who are building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup, the Labour shadow minister has written to Jim Boyce to invite him on a planned trip to Qatar on 31 March.
In the letter, seen by the Guardian, he says the situation faced by some migrant workers in Qatar  as detailed by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International and in a series of reports by the Guardian  ""amounts to forced labour"".
The International Trade Union Confederation has predicted that up to 4,000 workers could die in the run-up to the tournament.
""The 2022 World Cup can be a success but not if it is built on the backs of working people treated like cattle,"" said Murphy in the letter. ""Instead, the focus brought by the World Cup must be a catalyst for change, not just for the workers building the World Cup venues, but for everyone building and working in the hotels, roads and railway projects that will help Qatar deliver for Fifa in 2022.""
Fifa has said that it wants to see progress on the issue and has appointed the German executive committee member Theo Zwanziger to lead a working party. The Qatar 2022 organising committee last month issued a 50-page charter guaranteeing basic standards of accommodation, pay and conditions for all workers on its stadiums.
But Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have said authorities must go further to ensure the standards applied to all workers and reform the kafala system. The ITUC went further still and said the document was a ""sham"".
Murphy called on Boyce to ensure that Fifa insists on wide-ranging changes to employment law for all workers. ""Fifa cannot take an attitude that the only things that are their business are the safe building of stadiums and laying of pitches. Fifa took the World Cup to Qatar and the entire process must now be Fifa's business,"" he said.
In the wake of the Guardian's original investigation in September into the conditions faced by Nepalese migrant workers, Boyce said he was ""appalled and very disturbed"" by the findings.
Murphy has asked Boyce to accompany him on a trip where he plans to meet with migrant workers and visit the camps in which they are housed.

The Guardian revealed last week that more than 500 Indian migrant workers have died in Qatar since January 2012, adding to the 382 Nepalese deaths there in the past two years during construction work connected to the World Cup. After coming under severe pressure from human rights groups across the world, the Qatar 2022 organising committee recently implemented a new charter relating to construction on its stadiums and the ministry of labour highlighted an expanded inspection programme.
Hadid, a prominent London-based Iraqi architect who has designed the Al-Wakrah stadium in Qatar, said the migrant deaths were a serious problem but it was a matter for the Qatari government.
""I have nothing to do with the workers,"" said Hadid. ""I think that's an issue the government  if there's a problem  should pick up. Hopefully, these things will be resolved.""
Asked if she was concerned, Hadid added: ""Yes, but I'm more concerned about the deaths in Iraq as well, so what do I do about that? I'm not taking it lightly but I think it's for the government to look to take care of. It's not my duty as an architect to look at it.
""I cannot do anything about it because I have no power to do anything about it. I think it's a problem anywhere in the world. But, as I said, I think there are discrepancies all over the world.""

They joined a grim tally that has now reached 717 Indians alone since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in December 2010.
Up to now, information on how many of Qatar's estimated 1.2 million migrant workers are dying has been limited to the Nepalese. That is partly because it was easier for NGOs to count the number of coffins returning to Kathmandu airport than those being repatriated to a huge country such as India. As with workers from other nations, including Bangladesh, Iran and Nepal, official information has been hard to come by.
Yet while we now know how many Indians, who make up around a fifth of the Qatari workforce, have died, we don't know who they were, or how.
The fate of migrant workers in the tiny Gulf state is by no means unique, with neighbouring countries facing similarly intractable issues. But Qatar's remarkable, money-no-object campaign to host the 2022 World Cup and an accompanying trolley dash around world sport, culture and academia has made it a focal point.
It took shocking reports by human rights groups and an investigation by the Guardian to force the issue up the agenda. And there has been a defensive reaction within Qatar. Some feel the tiny country, with its lucrative reserves of liquid gas, has been victimised.
The danger is, in the face of western criticism and in the strong belief they have done more than most of their neighbours to be progressive, that they will now circle the wagons.
Fifa and the Qatar World Cup organising committee are now tangled in a Gordian knot. The human rights groups that have been pressuring Fifa and the Qataris demand to know whether there will be any meaningful reform to improve the welfare and safety of workers on all building projects. In Qatar itself, where politics has been described as akin to a medieval star chamber, an internal battle is raging. There are liberal forces who want to change the labour laws but are equally aware that sweeping away the kafala system that ties migrant workers to their employers would place huge question marks over its ability to fulfil its ""2030 Vision"" for the country.
The dizzying and unprecedented plan to spend hundreds of billions transforming the infrastructure of a country that was largely desert as recently as the 1970s can only be founded on cheap migrant labour.
Therein lies the dilemma  not only for the Qatari authorities, but for the British, German and French companies that have profited handsomely from the bonanza.
Abolish the culturally embedded kafala system and with it may go the mechanism for ensuring the almost absurdly ambitious plans to build cities, metro lines, roads and airports from scratch.
A previous forecast that Qatar would spend £137bn in the run up to the 2022 World Cup has, remarkably, proved an underestimate.
A senior executive at one of Qatar's largest banks told a conference in Bahrain last month that the Gulf state would spend £123bn on infrastructure projects in the next four years alone as it attempts to position itself for the future.
In a letter to the European parliament, Qatar's ministry of foreign affairs last week said it had increased the number of inspections and sanctioned 500 companies in January alone. A comprehensive charter has been published for contractors working specifically on World Cup stadiums, with the organising committee insisting it can act as a beacon for change.
These moves are designed to show the world that it is at last grappling with a complex problem. But those who have seen the deadly effects of lack of enforcement, mixed messages and a kafala system that virtually invites abuse say that they are not nearly enough.
""There are figures within Qatar who recognise just how damaging this issue is and who appreciate the importance of labour reform, but they are facing strong opposition from a short-sighted business community that is stubbornly opposed to the notion of loosening the grip on its foreign workers,"" said Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch.
""It is up to the new Emir and those close to him to placate these opponents and convince them that labour reform is not only feasible, it is in every Qatari's best interests.""
The Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, ascended to power last year after his father, who oversaw the World Cup bid and set in train the huge spending spree, handed over power.
That has left the 33-year-old at the mercy of a range of courtiers. Under pressure from within and without, it remains to be seen which way he will jump.Aware of the employment opportunities on offer, the mother countries of those migrant workers appear reluctant to rock the boat, while also doing too little to tackle the agents and middle men who prey on those seeking a passage to work in Qatar and neighbouring Gulf states. Until recently, it suited both to maintain silence, with Fifa caught in the middle and floundering. It is increasingly clear that will no longer be tenable.
McGeehan said: ""Fifa can't say it wasn't warned and can't plead impotence in the face of these figures. It has to send the strongest possible message to their Qatari partners that they need to implement reforms immediately."""

Official figures confirmed by the Indian embassy in Doha reveal that 237 Indians working in Qatar died in 2012 and 241 in 2013. A further 24 Indians have died in January 2014.
These come after the Guardian revealed last month that 185 Nepalese workers had died in Qatar in 2013, taking the total from that country to at least 382 over two years.
Human rights groups and politicians said the figures meant Fifa could not ""look the other way"", and should be leading demands for Qatar to improve conditions for the estimated 1.2 million migrant workers fuelling a huge construction boom.
The figures from the Indian embassy show that 233 Indian migrants died in 2010 and 239 in 2011, taking the total over four years to 974. Since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in December 2010, there have been 717 recorded Indian deaths.
However, the Indian embassy did not provide further details on who those individuals were, their cause of death or where they worked. But analysis of the lists of dead Nepalese workers showed that more than two-thirds died of sudden heart failure or workplace accidents.
Qatar's ministry of labour and social affairs told the Guardian: ""With specific regard to these new figures, we were aware that local media had previously reported some of these headline numbers, and we are clarifying them. Clearly any one death in Qatar or anywhere else is one death too many  for the workers, for their families, but also for Qataris who welcome guest workers to our country to perform valuable jobs. We are working to understand the causes of these deaths  as these statistics could include a range of circumstances including natural causes, and road safety incidents, as well as a smaller number of workplace incidents.""
Nicholas McGeehan, a Gulf researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: ""These figures for Indian deaths are a horrendous confirmation that it isn't just Nepalese workers who are dying in Qatar.""
Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, said: ""Preparations for the 2022 World Cup cannot go on like this  the trickle of worrying reports from the construction sites of Qatar has become a torrent.
""Some of the practices we know are taking place in Qatar amount to forced labour, and there are widespread concerns that the death toll could reach well into the thousands if nothing is done.""
Last week, a hearing at the European parliament heard from human rights groups, Fifa and other interested parties after a resolution was passed last year calling for action on the issue as construction of 2022 World Cup venues begins in earnest.
Despite the Qatar 2022 organising committee implementing a new charter relating to construction on its stadiums and the ministry of labour highlighting an expanded inspection programme, human rights groups and trade unions have repeated their call for structural change in the face of hundreds of deaths.
In November, Amnesty warned in a damning report that workers were enduring 12-hour days in sweltering conditions and living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation.
The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) has warned that up to 4,000 workers may die before a ball is kicked in 2022 without meaningful reform of the kafala system, which ties workers to their employers, and stringent control of the myriad construction companies and subcontractors involved.
The ITUC, which has campaigned consistently for better rights for migrant workers across the Gulf, has called the publication of the charter a sham because it does not deal with structural problems created by the kafala system..
Many workers arrive in Qatar already heavily in debt, having paid huge sums to middle men to secure contracts in the fast growing Gulf state.
A senior executive at one of Qatar's largest banks told a conference in Bahrain last month that the Gulf state would spend £123bn on infrastructure projects in the next four years alone. The hosting of the World Cup is an integral part of Qatar's unprecedented 2030 National Vision building project.
There are an estimated 1.2 million migrant workers in Qatar. Those from India make up 22% of the total, with a similar proportion from Pakistan. Around 16% are from Nepal, 13% from Iran, 11% from the Philippines, 8% from Egypt and 8% from Sri Lanka.
The Qatar World Cup organisers believe that by holding their own contractors to higher standards they can create momentum for change and that improved rights for workers could be one legacy benefit of hosting the tournament.
The ministry of foreign affairs has also emphasised that it is stepping up efforts to hold contractors to existing labour laws, sanctioning 2,000 companies in 2013 and a further 500 in January 2014 alone.
The statement from the Qatari ministry of labour and social affairs added: ""Where any liability is found to rest with employers, the ministry and Qatari law authorities will pursue these cases through the relevant legal channels. We have increased the number of trained labour inspectors by 25%, and continue to hire new inspectors, with over 11,500 random spot-checks of workplaces carried out in the past three months.
This, in order to enforce our existing labour laws, with the aim of the prevention of any further workplace incidents.""
Law firm DLA Piper has been engaged to prepare a report on all issues surrounding Qatar's use of migrant labour, which is expected to be published next month.
But human rights groups have maintained that Qatar must prove it is serious about reforming its labour laws. Amnesty's James Lynch, who wrote last year's report, called on the Qatari and Indian authorities to provide more detail on the circumstances of the deaths.
""This issue is not restricted to one country of origin,"" said Lynch. ""It is critical that the Qatari government works urgently with the governments of migrant workers' countries of origin to investigate the main causes of migrant workers' deaths and develops a transparent plan to address these, particularly where deaths relate to industrial accidents, work conditions and access to healthcare.""
Fifa has asked Qatar to provide evidence of meaningful progress in reforming labour law but the president of world football's governing body, Sepp Blatter, has said its status as hosts is not under threat.
Murphy, who will travel to Nepal and Qatar in the coming weeks, said: ""Fifa cannot simply look the other way. Football's governing body should be leading demands for change, not dragging its feet."""

The grim statistic comes from the Pravasi Nepali Co-ordination Committee, a respected human rights organisation which compiles lists of the dead using official sources in Doha. It will pile new pressure on the Qatari authorities  and on football's world governing body, Fifa  to curb a mounting death toll that some are warning could hit 4,000 by the time the 2022 finals take place.
It also raises the question of how many migrant workers in total have died on construction sites since Qatar won the bid in 2010. Nepalese workers comprise 20% of Qatar's migrant workforce, and many others are drafted in from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
A focus on the Nepalese deaths has seen Fifa and Qatar battling a PR crisis that threatens to cast a long shadow over the event. Last week, appearing before EU officials, Theo Zwanziger, a senior Fifa executive who has publicly criticised the decision to award the tournament to Qatar, pledged that his organisation would be carrying out ""on-the-spot visits"" to ensure that workers' rights were being respected.
But the promise is unlikely to reassure human rights organisations and labour groups, which have raised repeated concerns about Qatar's kafala employment system, under which migrant workers are tied to their ""sponsor"" employers.
Qatar's World Cup authorities recently issued detailed guidelines that they hope will address concerns about their employment laws. The 50-page report, Workers' Welfare Standards, provides a breakdown of the guidelines that 2022 organisers expect contractors and sub-contractors to observe. But this has not stopped the death toll rising, nor continuing international criticism.
Jim Murphy, Labour's shadow international development minister,, who is expected to visit Qatar soon, raised the issue again this week. Writing in the Guardian, Murphy said: ""People don't have to die to bring us this or any other World Cup or sporting event; not a single worker died building the sites for the London 2012 Olympics. According to the International TUC, the 2022 World Cup risks 4,000 lives.""
The continued criticism will prove embarrassing for Qatar as it prepares for a visit from Prince Charles.
The symbolic total of 400 deaths, which the Observer understands will be confirmed in the next few days, will also invite questions not only about working conditions on sites but also about the treatment of construction workers.
The Observer has learned of the horrific case of Noka Bir Moktan, a 23-year-old who was said to have died of ""sudden cardiac arrest"" in October 2013, although photos of his corpse show he suffered a collapsed chest, apparently consistent with ill-treatment.
Moktan's family come from a poor village in Nepal's remote hill district of Ilam. His elderly father borrowed 175,000 rupees (about £1,000) to pay for his passage and agency fees to Qatar, in the hope that he would be able to send some of his earnings home. The money, was borrowed from a loan shark and was supposed to be reimbursed by Moktan's Qatari employer, but this did not happen. The family now fear that the loan shark will demand that Moktan's two sisters, aged 14 and 16, who were collateral for the loan, be sent to work in brothels in Mumbai to pay off the debt.
Moktan's tragic case is far from untypical. Last November, Amnesty International issued a report warning that many workers were complaining about poor health and safety standards, including some who said they were not issued with helmets on sites. A representative of Doha's main hospital stated that more than 1,000 people were admitted to its trauma unit in 2012 having fallen from heights at work.
Researchers also found migrant workers living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation with no air-conditioning and overflowing sewage. Several camps lacked power and researchers found one large group of men living without running water.
""It is simply inexcusable in one of the richest countries in the world that so many migrant workers are being ruthlessly exploited, deprived of their pay and left struggling to survive,"" Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said at the time the report was published.
Some have gone as far as to call for Qatar to lose its right to host the tournament. But Zwanziger said such a move would be ""counterproductive"". He told the European parliament sub-committee on human rights that ""it would simply mean that the spotlight would be put away from them"".
The headline, caption and introduction to this article were amended on 16 Feb 2014 to make it clear that 400 Nepalese workers have died on construction sites across Qatar, not just on World Cup sites"

But a Fifa board member dismissed all talk of reversing the decision to hold the tournament there even if conditions were not improved.
A European parliament hearing on the scandal, first revealed by the Guardian last year, was told that Qatar was a slave state for migrant workers, scores of whom had died in appalling conditions while or after working on the building sites of the Gulf country.
Theo Zwanzinger, Germany's member of the Fifa executive, admitted conditions for migrant workers in Qatar were ""absolutely unacceptable"", agreed that human rights considerations should play a bigger role in the decisions of world and European football authorities, and added that Fifa would be carrying out detailed and independent monitoring of the working conditions surrounding the World Cup building boom. But there could be no going back on decisions already taken.
""This feudal system existed [in Qatar] before the World Cup,"" he said. ""What do you expect of a football organisation? Fifa is not the lawmaker in Qatar.""
Human rights activists and trade unionists demanded a more forceful role by Fifa at the meeting, which also heard wrenching testimony from the French-Algerian footballer Zahir Belounis, who had his passport confiscated and was denied an exit permit because of a dispute with his Qatari club. He was trapped in Qatar for two years largely unpaid and unable to leave.
""I just wanted to go home,"" he told the hearing. ""I'm the victim of a system of modern slavery.""
Much of the criticism of Qatar centred on the so-called kafala system in the labour market, which essentially confers quasi-ownership rights over employees or migrant labourers, a form of neo-feudalism.
The Qatari World Cup organisers submitted a 50-page report this week pledging to improve the plight of migrant workers. Chairing the meeting, the German Greens MEP Barbara Lochbihler said the Qatari promises were welcome but that a more systemic policy was needed rather than piecemeal remedies.
The Qatari government sent a letter to the parliament in Brussels on Thursday stating that about 2,000 companies had been blacklisted last year and almost 500 so far this year for questionable labour market and employment practices.
MEPs complained at the hearing that the Qatari embassy in Brussels had declined to take part in the hearing and that firms recruiting workers for contracts in Qatar had also stayed away, as did Uefa, the European footballing authority.
Zwanzinger signalled that there were frictions within Fifa and Uefa over how to deal with political, ethical and human rights issues.
""If you continue to run the World Cup in a state which enslaves workers, it shames the game. The government must end of the system of kafala if the World Cup is to be played in Qatar in 2022,"" said Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the international trades union congress. ""We want hear from the Fifa president and executive committee about how they will guarantee that the World Cup must only go ahead if there is legal reform to kafala and for workers' rights. The new charter from World Cup organisers in Qatar sets out sham conditions, without even any means to ensure that companies comply.""
Zwanzinger declined to give such assurances from Fifa.
""That would be absolutely counter-productive,"" he said. ""Pressure and threats won't achieve much  We have a duty. The decision has been taken to grant the World Cup to Qatar, whether I like it or not.""
Burrow said: ""Qatar is a slave state for 1.4 million migrant workers. It doesn't have to be that way. Qatar chooses to build its modern nation with the labour of migrant workers and deliberately chooses to maintain a system that treats these workers as less than human."""

Ahead of a key European parliament hearing on the subject, shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy said world football's governing body ""cannot pretend that the only things that matter are the pitches and the stands"". He also called on the British government to do more to protect migrant workers.
The European parliament meeting follows a resolution last year that expressed concern over the plight of the 2m migrant workers in Qatar and urged Fifa to send a ""clear and strong"" message over the issue.
Since the publication of damning reports by human rights organisations and a series of Guardian articles revealing the scale of the suffering of migrant workers, pressure has grown on the Qatar authorities.
""This isn't just about the World Cup venues, a commitment that covers only stadia isn't enough,"" said Murphy in an article for the Guardian. ""Many hotels, roads and railway projects under construction in Qatar are geared towards helping the tiny state deliver for Fifa in 2022.""
A senior executive at one of Qatar's largest banks told a conference in Bahrain last month that the Gulf state would spend $205bn on infrastructure in the next four years.
Murphy said that the government should examine ways to make existing budgets stretch further in order to expand the Department for International Development's current Work In Freedom programme.
The programme, which aims to fight forced labour, currently covers 100,000 girls and women from South Asia. Murphy said it could include a similar number of construction workers in Qatar.
Official records show that at least 185 Nepalese migrant workers died in 2013, many from heart failure and workplace accidents. The numbers killed from other nations including Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India have not been revealed.
""Fifa must receive a full report from Qatar, cataloguing the full scale of the problem  and a serious plan to make things right. Nothing less will do. The shortcomings in the current system leave too many vulnerable people exposed,"" said Murphy, who plans to travel to both Nepal and Qatar in the next few weeks.
""Qatar has come an incredibly long way in the last twenty years, and there have been real advances that should not be ignored. But the simple fact is that the conditions faced by some of these workers  and no-one is suggesting it's every single one -fall within the International Labour Organisation's definition of forced labour.""
The Qatar 2022 organising committee this week issued a 50-page charter guaranteeing basic standards of accommodation, pay and conditions for all workers on its stadiums. The move was welcomed by Fifa, who will be represented at Thursday's meeting by German executive committee member Theo Zwanziger, who is liaising with NGOs and trade union organisations to co-ordinate its response.
""What we need are clear rules and steps that will build trust and ensure that the situation, which is unacceptable at the moment, improves in a sustainable manner,"" he said last month.
While Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch gave a cautious welcome to the limited progress represented by the Supreme Committee's new standards, they said authorities must go further to ensure they applied to all workers and reform the kafala system that binds workers to their employers.
The International Trade Union Congress, which has been a key campaigning voice in the debate, was more critical still. Its general secretary Sharan Burrow said the proposals were a ""sham"" and if Fifa was serious it would demand changes to the law.
""Unlawful practices will only continue with these provisions, which reinforce a system of forced labour with kafala. Qatar's announcement is reaction to public pressure, but it won't take the pressure off workers,"" she said.
""Similar provisions announced by the Qatar Foundation nearly a year ago have made no difference. The death toll of workers in Qatar has increased. Qatar has to change its laws, nothing else will do.""
Last month Fifa wrote to the Qatari organisers demanding a detailed report on the improvement of working conditions in the months since president Sepp Blatter visited the emir in November following the Guardian's revelations."

Cup in Qatar has promised that contractors who build its stadiums will be held to high standards on the welfare of migrant workers, in the wake of trenchant and sustained criticism.
But the promises, made after demands for a progress update from football's governing body Fifa, do not deal with wider concerns about workers engaged in the £137bn construction boom underpinning World Cup infrastructure.
Faced with a public meeting on the issue in the European parliament on Thursday, the renamed Qatar 2022 supreme committee for delivery and legacy has insisted it is making ""tangible progress"" toward reform.
Qatari authorities have been heavily criticised by human rights groups and trade unions since a Guardian investigation revealed the scale of the abuse of migrant workers from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and elsewhere who are the backbone of the World Cup construction and the country's wider Qatar Vision 2030 building project.
The Guardian revealed that at least 185 Nepalese workers died in Qatar in 2013, many from heart failure or workplace accidents. Official figures on the death tolls among workers from other countries have yet to emerge.
The fresh commitments have been published in a 50-page document that sets out detailed standards on payment of wages, accommodation and welfare and promises to introduce a tough new inspection regime. It says that it addresses ""some of the most critical concerns highlighted in recent reports about working and living conditions of workers in Qatar's construction centre"".
It is essentially an updated version of the worker's charter published last March , designed to underline the extent to which the World Cup organising committee is taking the issue seriously.
However, it only deals with the construction of the stadiums, which is due to begin in earnest this year. Early work has begun on Al Wakrah stadium and four other stadiums will be in various stages of construction throughout the year.
Just 38 workers, of the hundreds of thousands engaged on infrastructure projects, are currently working specifically on World Cup stadiums.
The charter does not deal with the wider issue of holding to account the myriad contractors and subcontractors working on Vision 2030 and the infrastructure that will underpin the World Cup.
""The supreme committee firmly believes that all workers engaged on its projects, and those of the other infrastructure developers in Qatar, have a right to be treated in a manner that ensures at all times their wellbeing, health, safety and security,"" says the document.
Human rights groups have called for more fundamental reform of the kafala system that ties workers to their employer and forbids them from leaving the country without permission. It has led to situations that have been compared to modern day slavery, where unscrupulous middlemen charge large sums to find employment for workers in Qatar and other Gulf states but leave them working long days in unsafe and insanitary conditions  and, in some cases, without pay.
Hassan al-Thawadi, the Sheffield University-educated secretary general of the organising committee, has consistently argued that hosting the World Cup can help raise standards. ""We have always believed that Qatar's hosting of the Fifa World Cup would be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives already being undertaken by Qatar, which will leave a legacy of enhanced, sustainable and meaningful progress in regards to worker welfare across the country,"" he said.
""We already see this progress taking place across Qatar on a daily basis and will continue to work hard to make our vision become the ever-present reality on the ground.""
The supreme committee hopes that it will encourage wider change by setting its own standards.
The ministry of labour and social affairs (Molsa) says it has increased the number of trained labour inspectors by 30% and carried out 11,500 spot checks in the past three months.
Dr Abdullah Saleh Mubarak Al Khulaifi, the labour minister, insisted it was determined to apply existing labour laws. ""Qatar is a young, developing nation experiencing a period of economic growth unprecedented in history, anywhere in the world. We cannot achieve these plans without the help of migrant workers,"" he said.
""Molsa will continue to support in enforcing these standards, and Qatar's existing labour laws, and to work with other government bodies in Qatar in holding accountable employers who fail to uphold these laws.""
Critics have continually argued that not enough is being done to hold subcontractors to existing labour laws. Fifa first promised to demand higher standards on workers' rights in 2011 and has been criticised for not doing more to force change.
Last month, it wrote to the Qatari organisers demanding a detailed report on the improvement of working conditions in the months since president Sepp Blatter visited the emir in November following the Guardian's revelations.
Fifa executive committee member Theo Zwanziger has been tasked with working with the International Trade Union Confederation to resolve concerns about Qatar. ""What we need are clear rules and steps that will build trust and ensure that the situation, which is unacceptable at the moment, improves in a sustainable manner,"" he said last month.
Nicholas McGeehan, Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, said it was too soon to claim significant progress and called for wider reforms. ""The standards are detailed and thorough and the supreme committee deserves credit for its efforts to improve standards on the projects within its control, but it is far too hasty to talk about tangible progress. These standards provide theoretical protection to a small fraction of Qatar's migrant workers,"" he said.
""They are not legally binding, they do not guarantee workers' rights to change employer,or their right to leave the country or their right to bargain collectively for decent pay and conditions if things go wrong. If the Qatari government is serious about reform, it should apply these standards to the whole migrant worker population, back them up with sanctions, and get to work on reform of the kafala system.""
The European parliament's human rights subcommittee will hold a public hearing on Thursday to address the issues surrounding migrant workers.
A report from law firm DLA Piper into the deaths of migrant workers, commissioned after the Guardian's original report and allegations from organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, is also due to be completed in the coming weeks."

World football's governing body said on Thursday that it wants to receive information on ""specific steps"" Qatar has taken since the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's trip to the capital Doha in November 2013  a visit that was marked by revelations about widespread exploitation of foreign construction workers in the country.
Fifa said it will be particularly interested in hearing about Qatar's efforts to improve the welfare and living conditions of migrant labourers.
Recent official figures showed that 185 Nepalese men died last year alone in Qatar, and the International Trade Union Confederation has warned that up to 4,000 workers could perish before the 2022 World Cup begins if there are no meaningful reforms to working conditions.
Fifa reiterated on Thursday that it expects the application of ""international norms of behaviour"" from all hosts of its events.
Executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said: ""Ultimately what we need are clear rules and steps that will build trust and ensure that the situation, which is unacceptable at the moment, improves in a sustainable manner.""
Once the Qatari report is delivered to Fifa it will be presented to a hearing at the European Parliament in Brussels on 13 February. The Parliament passed a resolution in November 2013 expressing concern at the plight of World Cup workers in Qatar."

British consultants have been working with a US developer to build improved accommodation with health centres, shops, recreational areas and even psychologists' consulting rooms as an alternative to squalid and overcrowded conditions which are believed to contribute to a high death toll among migrant labourers.
The project was due to open its first beds in April but that is not likely to happen now until at least July as the Qatar authorities have failed to agree a streamlined planning process to speed through delivery. The delay has been attributed locally to the emirate's slow bureaucracy.
It comes after the Guardian revealed on Friday that 185 workers from Nepal had died in Qatar in 2013, sparking complaints from workers' rights groups that Qatar was failing to follow through on its pledges to take action.
It has also emerged that football's governing body Fifa has asked human rights groups to submit practical proposals to improve working conditions.
Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International and the International Trade Union Confederation will provide advice. Fifa said over the weekend that ""fair working conditions with a lasting effect must be introduced quickly, consistently and on a sustained basis in Qatar"".
The Nepalese make up about a sixth of Qatar's 2 million migrant workers. Death rates among those from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are yet to emerge and thousands of workers continue to endure overcrowded and insanitary living conditions in labour camps where rooms accommodate a dozen people. The new housing is based on three-bedroom homes with a limit of four workers to a room.
Simon Trafford, director of Quantex Qatar, which is working on the project, said there had been no commitment from the authorities on a streamlined planning system. ""One would like to think this will improve because things can be quite prolonged,"" he said.
Trade unions have warned that the death toll could reach 4,000 by the time the first ball is kicked. Amnesty's general secretary, Salil Shetty, last year complained that some workers were being ""ruthlessly exploited, deprived of their pay and left struggling to survive"".
Hassan al-Thawadi, head of the 2022 organising committee, pledged last year to work to stop the death toll and said the ""kefala"" system, which ties workers to their employers, was being reformed. ""For us, any number [of deaths] above zero is unacceptable and we are working to make sure that stays that way,"" he said.
Trafford, who is based in the Qatari capital Doha, said that despite the delay there was evidence the government was taking the issue of human rights seriously.
He said the ministry of municipality and urban planning, which has the task of procuring new labour camps for tens of thousands of new migrant workers, has been co-ordinating with the Qatar Foundation, a government-linked not-for-profit organisation that has drawn up welfare standards for the humane treatment of migrant workers.
It issued a tender last month for a 28,000-person labour camp in 7,000-bed ""villages"". The document for the ""permanent male integrated workers' community"" says the workers will be accommodated on a single site in seven 4,000-strong compounds each ""self-sufficient in operational assets such as food provision and consumption, laundry, general cleaning, parking areas, open areas, shops, recreation and cultural facilities as required by labour, health, environment and other authorities"".
It does not specify living standards but says further information will be provided later in the procurement process.
HRW said references to ""worker welfare"" in the document were too vague.
""The Guardian's revelations on worker deaths in 2013 confirm yet again the often tragic effect on young men of a highly exploitative labour system and a construction sector beset by a culture of impunity,"" said Nicholas McGeehan, a gulf researcher at HRW.
""Better housing is a must and we support projects aimed at housing workers in a manner that affords them their basic dignity, but it won't protect migrant workers from exploitation. Indeed, if initiatives to improve housing are not accompanied by key labour reforms, their effect will simply be to make people less uncomfortable about workers' exploitation."""

faced by migrant construction workers building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has been laid bare by official documents revealing that 185 Nepalese men died last year alone.
The 2013 death toll, which is expected to rise as new cases come to light, is likely to spark fresh concern over the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and increase the pressure on Fifa to force meaningful change. According to the documents the total number of verified deaths among workers from Nepal  just one of several countries that supply hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to the gas-rich state  is now at least 382 in two years alone. At least 36 of those deaths were registered in the weeks following the global outcry after the Guardian's original revelations in September.
The revelations forced Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, to promise that football would not turn a blind eye to the issue following a stormy executive committee meeting. Qatar's ministry of labour hired law firm DLA Piper to conduct an urgent review and Hassan al-Thawadi, chief executive of the World Cup organising committee, said the findings would be treated with the utmost seriousness, vowing that the tournament would not be built ""on the blood of innocents"". The DLA Piper report is expected to be published in the coming weeks.
The Nepalese make up about a sixth of Qatar's 2 million-strong population of migrant workers. Verified figures for the 2013 death rates among those from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and elsewhere have yet to emerge.
The Nepalese organisation working with the families of dead workers to repatriate their bodies and campaign for adequate compensation from the companies that employed them under the kafala sponsorship system said on Friday that Fifa should do more.
The Pravasi Nepali Co-ordination Committee (PNCC), which has cross-checked the figures from official sources in Doha against death certificates and passports, is still receiving new cases on a regular basis. The Guardian has seen evidence of at least a further eight cases, which would take the 2013 total to 193.
The PNCC called on Fifa's sponsors to reconsider their relationship with world football's governing body, which awarded the World Cup to Qatar in December 2010.
""Fifa and the government of Qatar promised the world that they would take action to ensure the safety of workers building the stadiums and infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. This horrendous roll call of the dead gives the lie to those reassurances,"" said the PNCC. ""These were young or otherwise able-bodied men, with their futures in front of them, families at home and everything to live for. Many have been literally worked to death. Some have met with even more sinister ends. All have been betrayed by Fifa.""
The Guardian investigation last year revealed that at least 44 Nepalese workers had died in Qatar between 4 June and 8 August, more than half of them of heart attacks, heart failure or workplace accidents. But the full list of deaths recorded during the year, collated by the Nepalese NGO from official sources and documents in Doha and seen by the Guardian, shows that the actual figure is much higher.
In June, July and August alone 65 deaths were recorded by the PNCC during summer months when temperatures can regularly top 40C. The causes included traffic accidents, blunt injuries and fractures ascribed to falls and suicide. But more than 65 of the deaths in 2013 are ascribed to ""sudden cardiac arrests"" and more than half to some kind of heart failure. Campaigners believe the cause of death is often officially listed as a cardiac arrest because it covers a ""multitude of sins"".
Asked last year by the Guardian why so many young Nepalese men died of heart attacks, the Qatari labour ministry said: ""This question would be better suited for the relevant health authorities or the government of Nepal.""
As long ago as 2011, Fifa said it would work with the International Trade Union Confederation to address labour issues with the Qatari authorities. ""We have a responsibility that goes beyond the development of football and the organisation of our competition,"" Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke said in November 2011.
But the ITUC has remained a strident critic of the lack of progress made by Qatari authorities on the issue, while groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have continued to highlight the appalling conditions suffered by some of the workers in a £137bn construction boom.
In November, Amnesty warned in a damning report that workers were enduring 12-hour days in sweltering conditions and living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation. The ITUC has warned that up to 4,000 workers may die before a ball is kicked in 2022 without meaningful reform of the kafala system and stringent control of the myriad construction companies and sub-contractors involved.
After the global outcry that followed the Guardian's coverage, Blatter travelled to meet the Emir of Qatar and declared it was ""on the right track"" in dealing with the issue. But following a meeting with the ITUC in Zurich a month later, Fifa said that ""fair working conditions with a lasting effect must be introduced quickly"".
The PNCC, which has painstakingly cross-checked death certificates and other documentation with official records in Doha, said Fifa and the Qatari government needed to move faster: ""Fifa president Sepp Blatter said in October there was 'plenty of time' to address this issue. For the labourers dying every week in Qatar to build the infrastructure to host Mr Blatter's World Cup, there is no time left.""
Attention is also turning to the role of Fifa's sponsors, with the PNCC joining calls for them to review their relationship with it. Visa and Adidas recently signed new deals until 2022. ""Qatar's failure to disclose or explain these deaths, and Fifa's failure to monitor them, are alarming in the extreme. We call upon the World Cup's corporate sponsors  Coca-Cola, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai and Budweiser  urgently to review their arrangements with Fifa,"" a spokesman said.
Last month the London mayor, Boris Johnson, travelled to Doha to drum up trade for British business. Foreign Office minister Hugh Robertson held talks with the Qataris aimed at boosting trade and said the UK would ""offer support"" in delivering the 2022 World Cup.
A spokesman for the Foreign Office insisted the issue of migrant workers was also raised. ""Mr Robertson discussed the issue of migrant workers with the Qatari authorities during his recent visit,"" he said.""
But the PNCC said that the flow of coffins returning to Kathmandu airport, which continued throughout December, even on Christmas Day, told its own story. ""Thanks to the work of the Guardian and other media, this abuse is finally being exposed,"" said the PNCC spokesman.
""We call upon civilised governments as a matter of the greatest urgency to demand that Qatar takes meaningful action to protect foreign workers on its soil  including reform of the kafala system of labour, which encourages employers to treat their workers as property rather than human beings.""
The full list of deaths recorded between January and September 2012, also seen by the Guardian, shows that at least 127 Nepalese nationals died during that period and there are believed to have been at least another 70 fatalities during the final three months of that year.
Qatar is spending huge sums at home and abroad in an attempt to position itself as the diplomatic and business hub of the Middle East and secure its position politically and financially for the years ahead.
Qatari officials insist moves are being made to hold construction companies, and their myriad sub-contractors, to existing labour laws, which they argue are among the strongest in the region.
Qatar's under-secretary to the ministry of labour, Hussain al-Mulla, has said that at least 99% of businesses are complying with the law. The ministry of labour says it is ""committed to ensuring that all workers are treated in a fair and just manner"".
The Qatar 2022 supreme committee, which is responsible for staging the World Cup and recently began work on its first stadium, pointed to its own workers' charter and said it was ""committed to the wellbeing, health, safety, security and dignity of every worker"".
""We anticipate 2014 being a big year for the supreme committee in terms of delivery, with up to five stadiums in various stages of construction. With this in mind, and as an evolution of the charter, we have worked hard to develop detailed workers' standards which will be enforced across all Qatar 2022 projects,"" a Qatar 2022 statement said.
""It has been our commitment and our belief from the first day of our bid to host the Fifa World Cup that we can utilise the power of football to accelerate positive social and human development across our country and our region.""
In a statement Fifa said: ""Fifa is working towards an urgent solution and as such is continuing to actively engage the dialogue between Qatar and various human rights and labour organisations to ensure that the initiated changes to improve the welfare of migrants workers are progressing with the necessary pace.

Engineers Against Poverty, a UK-based NGO, presented the recommendation, along with others, to representatives of contractors and banks at a meeting in Doha on Tuesday at the launch of the Improving employment standards in construction in Qatar report (pdf).
The Gulf state has come under intense international pressure to prevent exploitation of migrant workers in the buildup to the 2022 football World Cup. Unions have warned that labour conditions in the country could result in up to 4,000 deaths before the tournament begins.
Representatives of the families of migrant workers who have been killed and injured on building sites in Qatar have called on Fifa, the world football governing body, to hand the tournament to another country unless the Doha leadership can guarantee worker safety.
In its report, Engineers Against Poverty said electronic payment would provide workers with the evidence needed to prove they had not been paid and allow them to seek redress.
""Non-payment and late payment of wages is one of the biggest concerns to migrant workers. It is also a potential source of disruption and delay to projects, and therefore a major risk to government clients and their project management consultants,"" Jill Wells, the research team leader, said.
Workers, who are usually paid in cash, often have to borrow large sums from moneylenders at high rates of interest to pay recruitment fees. It is critical for them to receive wages on time and in full so debts can be repaid promptly.
The report argues that while there are limits to the control contractors can exert over subcontractors, the former can do more to ensure that all workers receive their wages on time. It says clients should consider including clauses in their contracts with main contractors requiring them to pay the wages of their subcontractors' workers if the latter fails to do so. Such legislation exists in India.
The main complaint from workers who come to Qatar's National Human Rights Committee for help is about late wage payments. A third of the 1,100 labourers surveyed by the NHRC said they never received their wages on time.
In 2010, 93% of the complaints handled by the ministry of labour were about delayed wages and two-thirds of complainants were construction workers. In 2012, the ministry received 6,000 complaints, with wages and denial of benefits the main problems.
Some contractors told Engineers Against Poverty that they paid cash in hand because most workers earn less than the minimum salary required to open a bank account. Yet the NGO said three companies were paying salaries to workers earning less than half of this amount by electronic bank transfers.
One contractor told Engineers Against Poverty that while providing accounts to low-paid workers was not profitable for banks, they could be persuaded to do so as banks hoped to secure more profitable lines of business from the big contractors.
""Paying through electronic bank transfer could provide workers with evidence to prove they have not been paid and allow them to seek a transfer of sponsorship,"" the report says. But as this is no guarantee of prompt payment, the main contractor should step in if subcontractors fail to pay workers on time.
The report also recommends that:
all public sector clients follow the approach adopted by the Qatar Foundation, a major client of the construction industry, in setting up a workers' welfare department to undertake regular welfare audits of contractors and subcontractors and aim to work only with those that comply with the foundation's standards on migrant workers' welfare.
Principal contractors should be required to set up a helpline for workers to alert all parties concerned to delayed payment of wages by subcontractors.
The labour department should be strengthened so the government can play a bigger role in enforcing its own laws and regulations and in clamping down on companies that flout the law and abuse workers.
The Qatar government should leverage its position with labour-sending countries whose economies are heavily dependent on remittances from migrant workers, and pressure their governments to step up efforts to address corruption and exploitation in the recruitment business.
Qatar is spending more than £100bn on facilities and infrastructure before the 2022 World Cup and is expected to bring in at least 500,000 more workers on top of the existing 1.2 million, including hundreds of thousands more from Nepal and India."

But things didn't go well.
First there was the pay. Ram Kumar says there wasn't any. Then there were the conditions  12-hour shifts, a shortage of food and finally, after a complaint to the manager, summary removal from the labour camp. It was so distressing that the 27-year-old Nepali lost his hair. After weeks in legal limbo at the Nepali embassy in Doha, he finally made it home. The nightmare was over, but a new one was just beginning.
""I spent six months in Qatar but did not receive a single rupee,"" he said from a remote village in Nepal, where he has found piecemeal work threshing cattle fodder.
""I was reluctant to come back home as I didn't earn any money ... When I got home my wife was weeping and even I did not feel good. I still feel very guilty. I have not done anything since I got back,"" he said. ""I just sit at home looking after my children. I came here for 10 days of work ... but it does not pay much.""
Ram Kumar was one of the Nepali workers who spoke to the Guardian for an investigation that exposed systematic exploitation of Nepalese migrant workers in Qatar's booming construction industry, including on a site directly linked to the 2022 World Cup.
The investigation found high levels of fatalities (44 in eight weeks over the summer), terrible living conditions and labour practices that in effect enslaved the migrant workers, depriving them of pay, permits and freedom to move around.
He paid a local agent in his village 120,000 rupees (about £775) to go to Qatar, far in excess of the legal limit stipulated by the government. The only way he could afford this was to borrow the money at an annual interest rate of 60%, but because he was unable to send any money home, his debt quickly ballooned to 500,000 rupees.
""When I was abroad, my wife took out more loans as my children were ill, so our debt grew to this huge amount,"" explained Ram Kumar. ""The only way I can pay it off is by going back abroad.""
In Qatar, Ram Kumar says he sometimes went 24 hours without food  ""12 hours' work and then no food all night"".
""When I complained, my manager assaulted me, kicked me out of the labour camp I lived in and refused to pay me anything. I had to beg for food from other workers.""
He rapidly found himself trapped, without a salary or the exit permit he needed to leave Qatar. Eventually, with the help of the Nepali embassy, he was able to return home, but he had to leave his salary, and his dignity, behind.
Now back home in Nepal, Ram Kumar may have escaped Qatar, but he is still bound by the debt he took on in order to pay Nepali recruitment agents for his job there. His attempts to get his money back have proved fruitless. ""When I got home I asked the local agent to return my money, as well as my unpaid salary,"" he said. ""He told me he would pay me back  but he has not given me anything so far.""
Despite being deceived by his local agent, Ram Kumar places the blame for his ordeal squarely with the Kathmandu-based agency, Marvelous Employment Nepal. There are more than 700 registered recruitment agencies, known as manpower companies, in the capital, Kathmandu. They rely on a network of thousands of unregulated local agents, who send workers to them from across the country, often for extortionate fees.
""It is the manpower company that cheated me. I called them [from Qatar] after I did not receive my salary, but they just consoled me every time saying they would talk to the company,"" he said.
Marvelous Employment Nepal denied any wrongdoing. ""We sent the return air ticket to bring Ram Kumar back from Qatar and we are no longer sending workers to that company. We offered to help him get a job in another country,"" said Kumar Gauli, the company's marketing director. ""We are ready to negotiate with Ram Kumar and help him as much as we can. We are willing to return what he paid to us.""
Marvelous Employment Nepal disputed Ram Kumar's claim that he did not receive any salary in Qatar.
""The recruitment agency has basically tried to buy off Ram Kumar by offering him another job instead of paying him the full compensation he deserves,"" said Samar Thapa, of the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions. ""We have to encourage the workers to punish the agencies or they will never change their behaviour.""
Until then, Ram Kumar and his wife, Hira Devi, have little choice. ""My husband should go abroad again to work  so that we can pay back our loans and manage our daily expenses,"" she said. ""I am worried as I have small children, two daughters and a son, to look after. I don't even have any land or a home and we are in huge debt.""
""If people asked for my advice, I would say Qatar is not a good place, so don't go to Qatar. I had a very hard time there,"" said Ram Kumar. ""I would tell people to go to other countries, but I would not recommend anyone to go to Qatar."""

The appalling conditions faced by thousands of migrant workers building the infrastructure for the 2022 football world cup in Qatar have not improved despite a growing outcry, according to the International Trade Union Confederation [ITUC].
Human rights organisations, Fifa and the European parliament have raised concerns about the plight of migrant workers in Qatar after a Guardian investigation revealed a rising toll of death, disease and misery at its World Cup construction sites.
But after a four-day visit to the country by an ITUC delegation, the organisation's general secretary, Sharan Burrow, said they had found ""no improvement in living and working conditions"" of migrant workers.
""This is an easy choice for the Qatari government. The perplexing question is, why won't they take it? Professional and poor workers alike tell the same stories; they came to Qatar with optimism and goodwill, only to face despair when their employer decides they are disposable and refuses to pay wages, sacks them without benefits, and/or refuses to sign their exit permit.""
Burrow said that during the visit the 11-member delegation held worker hearings and were shocked by ""tales of terror"", stories increasing numbers of women and children in detention centres, and rising discontent and unrest in workers in ""squalid labour camps"".
""What we've seen this week can be summarised as how not to design a system for the global workforce on any basis: human and labour rights; goodwill and international reputation or; productivity based on loyalty and efficiency,"" said Burrow. ""International companies should be on notice about the reputational risk of doing business in Qatar without respect for workers' rights.""
The Guardian first reported on the plight of migrant workers in Qatar in September. The investigation revealed that 44 Nepalese workers died from 4 June to 8 August this year, about half from heart failure or workplace accidents.
Workers described being forced to work in 50C heat without drinking water by employers, who withhold salaries for several months and retain their passports to prevent them leaving the country.
The investigation found that sickness was endemic, that conditions were frequently overcrowded and insanitary, and that many were going hungry.
The ITUC has warned that as many as 4,000 migrant workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022, while an in-depth Amnesty report last month revealed fresh evidence of wide-scale and endemic mistreatment of workers, many of whom are tied to their employer under the kafala system.
Football's governing body, Fifa, has said: ""Fair working conditions with a lasting effect must be introduced quickly in Qatar"", and president Sepp Blatter admitted that widespread abuse of migrant workers was ""unacceptable"" following a meeting with international union leaders in Zurich.
The Qatari authorities have insisted they are being proactive and say the World Cup can be a catalyst for change.
Burrow said: ""Fifa have called for the improvement of core international labour organisation standards and an end to the kafala system. They will report back in March 2014. We can only hope the Qatar government will make the right choice."""

Human-rights organisations welcomed the move but said they would continue to campaign for the exit visa system to be abolished amid reports of widespread mistreatment of migrant workers building the wherewithal for the 2022 World Cup.
In a message tweeted by his brother Mahdi, Belounis said: ""I thank people for everything. If I am out, it is because of your fantastic commitment and support for human rights.""
His brother confirmed that an exit visa has been granted and that he expects Zahir to return to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris with his wife and two young children on a flight that will take off on Thursday.
The French ambassador to Qatar, Jean-Christophe Peaucelle, also confirmed that following ""intensive work"" with the Qatari authorities Belounis has been issued with an exit visa and will be able to return home.
Belounis had been in dispute with his former club, El-Jaish, for more than two years over unpaid wages. But even after agreeing to give up his claim to the money, he had not been allowed to leave the country under the kafala sponsorship system that ties migrant workers to their employers.
In a desperate plea to the Qatar 2022 ambassadors Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane, highlighted by the Guardian this month, Belounis said he had been ""living a nightmare"" for the past two years. ""This is great news for Zahir and his family, but there are still huge numbers of men and women still trapped in Qatar on account of its exit visa system,"" said Nicholas McGeehan of Human Rights Watch.
""Their rights are no less important than Zahir's and their mistreatment is no less shameful. Hopefully this outbreak of common sense is a precursor to Qatar abolishing the exit visa system altogether and getting serious on labour reform.""
The decision to allow Zahir to leave came as the global players' union FifPro was due to arrive in the country with representatives from the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) for four days of talks. ""As the worldwide representative for professional footballers, FifPro will be able to welcome back a long-lost family member,"" it said following news that Belounis had secured an exit visa.
The organisation had said it was ""seriously concerned"" by allegations of human-rights violations in the construction of World Cup stadiums and related infrastructure.
These have become a major issue for Fifa and the World Cup organisers since in-depth reports by human-rights organisations and an investigation by the Guardian into the plight of Nepalese migrant workers highlighted the scale of the problem. The ITUC has claimed that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked unless there is serious reform of the system to hold subcontractors to new laws, and kafala is abolished.
""A grave injustice is nearly over for Zahir and his family. One man and his family have come to illustrate the conditions faced by 1.3 million migrant workers in Qatar,"" said Sharan Burrow, the ITUC general secretary. ""The torment that Zahir and his family have been put through because of bad laws which give workers no rights should never be repeated.""
Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, has said ""fair working conditions"" must be introduced quickly in Qatar. Blatter, said it would host an ""amazing World Cup"" and was ""on the right track"" with regard to workers' rights. But a week later he met the ITUC and others in Zurich and Fifa put out a statement in which it said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and insisted ""fair working conditions with a lasting effect must be introduced quickly in Qatar"".
This week, on a trip to Kuala Lumpur, he appeared to blame the European media for ""attacking"" Qatar over the issue and claimed the focus on workers' rights was ""not fair"". The Qatar Football Association has denied Belounis's claims, saying that it had helped him recover unpaid wages when he played for another club in the country, but that he had never lodged a complaint about al-Jaish."

Belounis, who recently wrote an open letter to the Qatar 2022 ambassadors Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola to highlight the fact he has been ""living a nightmare"", has repeatedly been told a solution is imminent and he will be allowed to leave but remains trapped in Doha.
He has been in dispute with his former club, al-Jaish, for more than two years over unpaid wages but, even after agreeing to give up his claim to the money, has not been allowed to leave the country under the kafala sponsorship system that ties migrant workers to their employers.
Fifpro has spoken out several times on the issue, most recently after Fifa said it would be unable to help Belounis because he had chosen to report the matter to local courts rather than following its dispute resolution system.
The union said that a delegation led by its board member Mads Oland, together with representatives of the International Trade Union Confederation, would carry the message that ""while Fifpro's primary concern must be the players, we will not overlook the tragedy which is currently unfolding in Qatar"".
It said it was ""seriously concerned by allegations of human rights violations in the construction of World Cup stadia and related infrastructure"" that have become a major issue for Fifa and the World Cup organisers since in depth reports by human rights organisations and an investigation by the Guardian into the plight of Nepalese migrant workers highlighted the scale of the problem.
Brendan Schwab, Fifpro's Asia chairman, said: ""Fifpro recognises what all parties are doing to try and help Zahir Belounis. Some are visible, others continue to work behind the scenes, but Fifpro appreciates all efforts in this difficult yet important matter.""
Fifpro said the kafala system was causing ""great injustice"" for footballers and all workers in Qatar. Human rights organisations such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch are cautiously optimistic that Qatar is now engaging on the issue but want to see concrete signs of practical progress such as an end to the exit visa system.
After a meeting with the Emir of Qatar this month, Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, said it would host an ""amazing World Cup"" and was ""on the right track"" with regard to workers' rights. But a week later he met with the ITUC and others in Zurich and Fifa put out a statement in which it said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and insisted ""fair working conditions with a lasting effect must be introduced quickly in Qatar"".
Meanwhile, Belounis remains trapped in Qatar with his wife and two young children in a near-empty apartment, despite entreaties from the French embassy to allow him to leave. The Fifpro delegation plans to meet with Belounis, as well as the Qatari football authorities, in a bid to secure his release.
In his letter, Belounis said he hoped that Zidane and Guardiola, as former players and parents themselves, would empathise with his predicament.
""Imagine what I am going through every day in a house that is half empty  because when they promised me that they would give me my exit visa, I sold my furniture  and when I see the look in my daughters' eyes, I feel ashamed, I feel disgusted with myself for inflicting such conditions on them.""
The Qatar Football Association has denied Belounis's claims, saying that it had helped him recover unpaid wages when he played for another club in the country but that he had never lodged a complaint about al-Jaish."

The Arsenal manager has urged Fifa to put enough pressure on the Qatari government to address the kafala system, which ties workers to their sponsors and has been heavily criticised from a human rights perspective. ""Fifa has made an investigation and hopefully will sort that out,"" said Wenger. ""It is down to Fifa to make those rules changed.""
Wenger was mindful that the living and working conditions, and the problems with exit visas which are controlled by the companies that sponsor immigrant workers, has been discussed at the highest levels lately. The European Parliament, who passed an emergency resolution condemning the practice, and an Amnesty International report which highlighted the issues, have increased pressure in the past week.
He has also been in touch with the family of Zahir Belounis, the French footballer who has been trapped in Qatar while his dispute over unpaid wages has been unresolved. ""I have been contacted by somebody from the family who asked for help,"" said Wenger. ""But what I've heard in France is that the French government is involved and they are in a much stronger position than anybody else to help out. I am just surprised he cannot get out of the country and I don't know why really.""
Belounis wrote an open letter to Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola in search of support for a system he described as ""slowly killing me"".

But there was disappointment among those who had proposed the motion, after the Christian Democrat and Conservative voting blocs succeeded in removing a clause calling on Qatar to abolish the kafala sponsorship system that ties migrant workers to their employers.
The resolution called on Qatar  under pressure after a Guardian investigation and a series of reports by organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch exposed the scale of the problem  to reform and uphold its labour laws.
The resolution reminds Fifa ""that its responsibility goes beyond the development of football and the organisation of competitions"".
Fifa said it welcomed the resolution. Despite previously saying there was ""plenty of time"" to sort out the issue, Fifa president Sepp Blatter this week said it should be addressed as a matter of urgency, following a meeting with trade union leaders in Zurich.
Around 88% of Qatar's 2 million population is made up of migrant workers, the highest ratio in the world. The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) has warned that 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022, if the government does not urgently reform the system.
The resolution registered concern over issues including ""long working hours, hazardous working conditions, the workers being unpaid for months, had their passports confiscated, forced to live in overcrowded labour camps, denied the right to form unions, and without access to free drinking water in extreme heat"".
The Qatari government, which has engaged the law firm DLA Piper to conduct an indepdendent review of abuses in the construction sector, said the resolution was ""premature"".
""Qatar takes the allegations that have been made concerning the construction sector extremely seriously and has therefore already put an independent review into those allegations in place, to be conducted as a matter of the utmost urgency,"" the Qatar foreign ministry said.
""Qatar will deal severely with any abuses on the part of companies operating in its construction sector, particularly relating to its migrant labour force.""
A new, in-depth Amnesty International report last Sunday revealed wide-scale and endemic mistreatment of workers, many of whom are heavily in debt and tied to their employer through the kafala system.
Green MEP Barbara Lochbihler, chair of the European parliament's subcommittee on human rights, said the resolution sent ""an important signal both to the Qatari government and international football authorities on the need to take urgent action to address the situation regarding forced and slave labour in Qatar"".
She added: ""While we regret that centre-right MEPs succeeded in removing a core demand, calling for the abolishment of the kafala system, the resolution nonetheless highlights the fundamental flaws of this system, which pushes thousands of migrant workers into a situation of forced labour. We would urge the Qatari government to repeal the kafala system as a matter of urgency and for Fifa to prioritise this in its relations with Qatar in the context of the World Cup."""

Workers' villages featuring health centres, shops, recreational areas and even psychologists' consulting rooms will be built in co-operation with the government of Qatar, according to Quantex Qatar, a building consultancy set up by two British quantity surveyors.
It is understood the plan has been accelerated after criticism from Amnesty International and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) after the Guardian exposed inhumane living conditions leading to the deaths of workers.
Some existing workers' accommodation requires a dozen people to sleep in one room with insanitary washing and cooking conditions and little cooling equipment. The new housing  to be built in collaboration with US company Global Building Solutions, which has acquired around 1m square metres of land  will be made up of three-bedroom homes with a limit of four to a room. Each bed will be screened off and each home will have a living room, bathroom and dedicated covered outdoor space.
Construction companies that lease them for workers will be given an insurance-backed guarantee that the facilities will meet both Qatar Foundation and international inspection standards.
""We have formed a joint venture to deliver modern, clean and humane workers' villages for the market in Qatar,"" said Michael Murphy, chief executive of GBS. ""We will build and operate the facilities at our cost, and will simply rent them out on a contract basis.""
""It is designed with one thing in mind - to improve the lives of the migrant workers who are fundamental to the success of Qatar 2022,"" Simon Trafford of Quantex Qatar told Building magazine.
It is estimated that at least another 500,000 migrant labourers will be needed in the eight years running up to the World Cup to build in excess of £100bn worth of infrastructure and facilities. So far Nepal and India have provided the largest number of migrant workers, who make up over 90% of the Gulf state's population. The ITUC predicted as many as 4,000 migrant workers could die in Qatar during that period unless conditions are improved.
In a report released this week, based on two recent investigations in Qatar and scores of interviews, Amnesty found workers living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation exposed to sewage and sometimes without running water. Amnesty's general secretary, Salil Shetty, said some workers were being ""ruthlessly exploited, deprived of their pay and left struggling to survive"".
The new housing will be semi-prefabricated in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the first units are expected to become available from April next year with thousands of beds a month made available."

World football's governing body has come under pressure to act in the wake of a Guardian investigation that revealed the scale of the abuse of migrant workers in Qatar who are building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup.
Blatter recently travelled to Doha to meet with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and subsequently gave a press conference in which he said the country's rulers were ""on the right track"" in dealing with the issue.
But after meeting with Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the Confederation of German Trade Unions, and Michael Sommer, president of the International Trade Union Confederation, Fifa said that the trio had agreed that ""fair working conditions must be introduced quickly, consistently and on a sustained basis in Qatar"".
Sommer said the trade union movement would not rest until conditions were ""fundamentally transformed"" but that Fifa made it clear they took their ""responsibilities on social policy seriously"". He added: ""Fifa recognises that its international significance brings a responsibility to influence decision-makers in Qatar.
""Qatar must guarantee the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation, end discrimination and forced labour and allow freedom of association for its 1.3 million migrant workers.
""The direction being taken by Fifa in this sense is welcome, and respects the concerns of people who live for the 'people's game'. We as trade unions maintain our demand: if Qatar does not respond properly, then consequences must follow, and the World Cup be taken from Qatar.""
The ITUC has warned that as many as 4,000 migrant workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022, while a new in-depth Amnesty report last Sunday revealed wide-scale and endemic mistreatment of workers, many of whom are tied to their employer under the kafala system.
Blatter admitted that the situation was ""unacceptable"" but the Fifa president said publicity generated by the controversial decision to award the World Cup to Qatar in 2022 had helped draw attention to the issue.
""Economic and political leaders must contribute to improving the unacceptable situation in Qatar. That is why I welcome the initiative shown by the DFB [German football federation] and ITUC because together we can achieve change,"" he said. ""I am convinced Qatar is taking the situation very seriously. These very discussions about Qatar show what an important role football can play in generating publicity and thus bringing about change.""
Human rights groups including Amnesty and Human Rights Watch are hopeful the international pressure building on the Qatari authorities will lead to concrete action. But they want to see meaningful practical steps, such as an end to the exit visa system that is also keeping French footballer Zahir Belounis trapped in the country, to prove their seriousness.
After meetings with Fifa as long ago as 2011 the Qatari government promised to take action but Amnesty's investigators still found widespread mistreatment of migrant workers by subcontractors effectively engaged in forced labour for major construction groups.
The report, based on two recent investigations in Qatar and scores of interviews, found workers living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation exposed to sewage and sometimes without running water.
It found that many workers, faced with mounting debts and unable to return home, have suffered ""severe psychological distress"", with some driven to the brink of suicide.
Theo Zwanziger, the German Fifa executive committee member who helped to convene the talks at Fifa's $100m headquarters in Zurich, said: ""The aim is to be in a position to report on concrete measures for Qatar at the executive committee meeting in March 2014. Large companies must be reminded of their duties in this area. The international community must also accept its responsibility.""
Zwanziger will be handed responsibility for ongoing dialogue with international trade union groups and human rights groups.
""The awarding of the World Cup and the considerable public exposure gives us the opportunity to point out irregularities and to exact lasting change,"" said Niersbach. ""If we succeed, then a lot will have been achieved. It was a matter of priority for us to quickly bring together the International Trade Union Confederation and Fifa as contractual partners for Qatar."""

From football, apart from the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's equivocations as to whether he recognises any responsibility at all for workers' rights, there has been near-silence about the conditions of workers who will build the stadiums, hotels and other structures for the 2022 World Cup.
This is in part due to football's habitual difficulty negotiating real life when it presses too close to the game's dream factory. In part, though, it reflects the extraordinary influence now wielded over the world's most popular sport by this tiny Gulf state of two million people, sticking out of Saudi Arabia on land described in the CIA factbook as ""slightly smaller than Connecticut"".
Almost unknown and unnoticed in football until its World Cup bid grew formidable, Qatar, the richest country in the world by GDP, at $103,900 per head, has now spread its name across the globe partly through colonising the game. In 2011 the Qatar Foundation paid 150m for a five-year deal to become the first ever sponsor of the Barcelona shirt, arguably the world's most prestigious advertising space. Just two years into that odd arrangement, by which the country's charitable arm was paying to sponsor a football club, the deal was converted into Barcelona's first genuinely corporate sponsorship.
Announcing Qatar Airways' agreement to pay 96m for a three-year deal, Javier Faus, Barcelona's vice-president for economy and strategy, said that for the money, Qatar Airways would get its name not only on to the players' chests but on the Camp Nou facade, on the iconic stadium's seats, next to the Nike logo, and: ""There will be a space for them in the museum.""
Qatar Airways' executive director, Akbar al-Baker, said of the deal with the club which had always previously stood apart, a member-owned institution representing Catalan regional pride: ""We share values, ambitions, courage and excellence with FC Barcelona.""
Qatar's wealth, generated by a $183bn GDP (in 2012) drawn mostly from natural gas, bought Paris St-Germain, in May 2011. That acquisition, by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investments, followed a lunch the previous year at the Elysée Palace shared by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, Michel Platini, the French president of Uefa, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who has since succeeded his father Hamad as the country's emir, and the Qatari prime minister.
Platini has acknowledged that Sarkozy wanted the Qataris to buy PSG and Platini to vote Qatar in Fifa's 2010 World Cup decision but denies that his president's urging influenced his vote. Platini's son, Laurent, was subsequently offered the job as chief executive of Burrda, the QSI-owned sports clothing company, which Platini says is completely unconnected to him voting for Qatar.
PSG's chances of competing at elite European level and paying the galactic wages of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and other top-rank signings were fuelled by this summer's startling deal, in which the Qatar Tourism Authority will pay up to 200m a year as a sponsor, for four years, reportedly backdated to start in 2012.
The emir, and the country itself, have never explained the thinking which truly lies behind this frantic interest in football. The country's national sports sector strategy 2011-2016 draws on the Qatar development plan to 2030 to claim: ""The principles for Qatar's sustainable and balanced development [are] based on a vibrant and prosperous economy that provides economic and social justice, stability and equal opportunity for all.""
Many observers agree that Qatar's strategy is part aspirational, rapidly to build western-friendly foundations for a post-gas modern economy, and part defensive, to make a noise big enough to transcend Saudi Arabia's looming shadow.
The softer part of Qatar's football influence is spread by the Aspire academy, an extraordinary talent-spotting programme which claims to assess 400,000 young footballers a year across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Promising young players are scrutinised at centres throughout Africa, and in Paraguay, Thailand and Vietnam. Paraguay and Thailand are the home territories of the influential former Fifa executive committee member Nicolás Leoz and serving exco member Worawi Makudi, but Aspire denies the locations are linked to World Cup voting. The best two players from each country are selected to be trained at an Aspire academy, in Senegal.
Last year Aspire bought a club in the Belgian second division, KAS Eupen, which is being used to give first-team senior experience to promising graduates from the Senegal and Doha academies. The quality of the Aspire facilities attracts leading clubs and their academies, including Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Everton and Liverpool in recent years, to go to Doha for warm weather training or to compete in junior competitions.
From the beginning the ""Aspire football dreams"" project has been viewed by some as a global recruiting operation for overseas players who will be given citizenship and play in the Qatari national team but Aspire's director general, Ivan Bravo, formerly Real Madrid's director of strategy, denies it. Aspire claims the programme is pure social responsibility, helping to improve the life chances of young people in poor parts of the world.
That noble mission rather clashes with the treatment of migrant workers building Qatar itself, and Fifa's headquarters and VIP centre in Doha, one of whom complained to the Amnesty researchers: ""Nepalis are treated like cattle."" Yet so far the football world, and ambassadors for Qatar's World Cup bid including Pep Guardiola, Zinedine Zidane and Gabriel Batistuta, and for Aspire, Lionel Messi, left, and Pelé, do not appear uneasy.
The bid for 2022, won in that feverish vote of Fifa's exco in 2010, was the fruition of Qatar's bold effort to make itself known: nation-building through football, with money and on a scale unprecedented."

If you're not from Chicago, it's unlikely  but if you are, it's a precious part of local folklore and a celebrated shape on the skyline. Towering amid the clustered phallic skyscrapers, the Crain Communications Building (its slightly more official name) was completed in 1983 with a prominent vertical slit in the front. Urban legend  for sadly, that is all it is  states that the building was designed by a woman sick to her back teeth of phallic architecture as a big feminist middle finger to the men who had made her live in the shadow of their huge metal penis replacements for decades.
The truth is that the vaginal resemblance is accidental, and the architect behind it very much male. But the story persists, and is still told with a sense of pride. Luckily for all of us who enjoy a good story involving construction and genitalia, this week has proven that Chicago's Vagina Building will soon be rubbing, er, shoulders with another case of ""accidental vagina representation"". The design for Qatar's new Al-Wakrah sports stadium has quickly gone viral: with its shiny, pinkish tinge, its labia-like side appendages and its large opening in the middle, the supposedly innocent building (""based upon the design of a traditional Qatari dhow boat"") was just asking for trouble. And trouble came, in the form of Buzzfeed and thousands of Twitter fans. Surely a well-populated Facebook group is only hours away.
As those who have tried to keep alive the tale of the Chicago Vagina Building know, there is something quite pleasing about a building shaped like a fanny. Look out on to the London skyline and penises are everywhere: the Gherkin, for instance, might even be visible from your office window right now, thrusting itself into the grey autumn sky among wisps of cloud, a proud red light shining at its very tip. And that's without even going into the phallic implications of Big Ben. The world even has an ode to the wonky boner, that lopsided erection that is the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Penile structures were just as abundant in the ancient world, of course  and while the humble yoni once had its heyday in certain parts of Asia, it still usually took a backseat wherever ornamental penises were involved.
The Qatari stadium's resemblance to a woman's private parts may be unintentional, but I for one applaud it. Perhaps the bigwigs who will be running the stadium should embrace this so-called faux pas and rebrand it as a deliberate nod towards the increasingly liberal Qatari policies concerning women in sport. In a world where sport and vaginas very rarely come together with such prominence (see every UK female footballer's salary versus every UK male footballer's salary), this can only be a good thing. And after all, why not have 45,000 people crammed inside a woman's reproductive system? It's not like they haven't been there before.
This article was amended on 19 November 2013. It originally referred to ""the bigwigs behind the design"" probably being men. The architect was female, Zaha Hadid. This sentence has now been changed accordingly."

The investigation also found that many thousands more were working in ""forced labour"" conditions, physically abused, often unpaid for months at a time, undocumented and at the whim and mercy of subcontractors. It said much of the abuse was made possible by the idiosyncratic ""kafala"" sponsorship system.
The kafala sponsorship system requires all unskilled labourers to have a sponsor, meaning migrant workers are unable to enter the country, leave it or change jobs without their company's permission.
The International Labour Organisation, a UN agency, said Qatar had much to do to meet proper international norms and that ""many of the abuses that take place which can lead to forced labour are still happening"".
The British government said it should be a precondition of delivering any major sports event that the highest standards of health and safety are enforced.
The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) warned that at least 4,000 workers would die between now and the time the first ball is kicked at World Cup 2022 if Qatar did not change working practices.
Following the investigation, the Qataris said it was concerned and would conduct an investigation. Since then, however, they have denied the allegations of brutal working conditions, long hours, lack of food and pay and squalid living conditions.
The world football body's president, Sepp Blatter, has avoided the question and last week even appeared to suggest that the Guardian reports were produced by journalists who had not even visited Qatar. The Guardian flatly rejected that suggestion."

The report  published a week after Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, met the country's emir and declared Qatar was ""on the right track"" in dealing with workers' rights  claims that some migrant workers are victims of forced labour, a modern form of slavery, and treated appallingly by subcontractors employed by leading construction companies in a sector rife with abuse.
The report, based on two recent investigations in Qatar and scores of interviews, found workers living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation exposed to sewage and sometimes without running water. It found that many workers, faced with mounting debts and unable to return home, have suffered ""severe psychological distress"", with some driven to the brink of suicide. Discrimination is common, according to the report, which says that one manager referred to workers as ""the animals"".
It describes one case in which the employees of a company delivering supplies to a construction project associated with the planned Fifa headquarters during the 2022 World Cup were subjected to serious labour abuses. Nepalese workers employed by the supplier said they were treated like cattle. Employees were working up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, during the summer months when temperatures regularly reach 45C.
Qatar's labour laws stipulate a maximum working day of 10 hours and say no one should work between 11.30am and 3pm during the summer months.
Last month Fifa was forced to address the issue of workers' rights after a Guardian investigation showed that dozens of Nepalese workers had died in recent months, prompting warnings from trade union organisations that 4,000 could be killed before the start of the football tournament.
Blatter promised to travel to Doha to meet the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and said he would raise the issue of workers' rights. But after the meeting and a presentation from the 2022 World Cup supreme committee, which includes many senior government representatives, Blatter said he was reassured by the progress that had been made on the issue.
That will not pacify human rights organisations, which have called for improvements to living and working conditions and for urgent action to reform the kafala sponsorship system that ties migrant workers to their employers. Amnesty said the sponsorship system ""permits abuse and traps workers"".
In November 2011, the Fifa general secretary, Jérôme Valcke, met Qatari officials to address the issue of workers' rights and the Qatari authorities promised to take the issue seriously.
But Amnesty's report, The Dark Side of Migration: Spotlight on Qatar's Construction Sector Ahead of the World Cup, is based on inspection visits in October 2012 and March 2013 and suggests change is nowhere near fast enough, despite a new charter introduced by the supreme committee, which applies only to the World Cup stadiums and not to infrastructure.
Amnesty said many workers had reported poor health and safety standards at work, including some who said they had not been issued with helmets on sites.
It quoted a representative of Doha's main hospital saying that more than 1,000 people were admitted to the trauma unit in 2012 after falling from height at work. Some 10% were disabled as a result and the mortality rate was significant.
Researchers also found migrant workers living in squalid, overcrowded accommodation with no air conditioning, exposed to overflowing sewage or uncovered septic tanks. One large group was found to be living without running water.
The organisation has also documented cases where workers were effectively blackmailed by their employers to get out of the country and others where they were not allowed to leave.
Researchers witnessed 11 men signing papers to get their passports back to leave Qatar in front of government officials, falsely confirming that they had been paid.
The company for which the men worked, ITC, had cashflow problems and 85 workers from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka were left in accommodation with no electricity or running water, with sewage leaking from the ground and piles of rubbish accumulating. Their salaries went unpaid for up to a year and they were forced to sign away any claim to the money before being allowed to leave.
""It is simply inexcusable in one of the richest countries in the world that so many migrant workers are being ruthlessly exploited, deprived of their pay and left struggling to survive,"" said Amnesty's general secretary, Salil Shetty.
""Our findings indicate an alarming level of exploitation in the construction sector in Qatar. Fifa has a duty to send a strong public message that it will not tolerate human rights abuses on construction projects related to the World Cup.""
Amnesty, which carried out interviews with 210 workers and held 14 meetings with Qatari authorities, said that multinational construction firms profiting from the $220bn (£137bn) construction boom in the tiny gas-rich state could not ignore the actions of the web of subcontractors employed to do the work.
""Construction companies and the Qatari authorities alike are failing migrant workers. Employers in Qatar have displayed an appalling disregard for the basic human rights of migrant workers. Many are taking advantage of a permissive environment and lax enforcement of labour protections to exploit construction workers,"" said Shetty.
Amnesty found that some of the workers who had suffered abuses were working for subcontractors employed by global companies, including Qatar Petroleum, Hyundai E&C and OHL Construction.
""Companies should be proactive and not just take action when abuses are drawn to their attention. Turning a blind eye to any form of exploitation is unforgivable, particularly when it is destroying people's lives and livelihoods,"" added Shetty.
Following his meeting, Blatter said Fifa could look forward to ""an amazing World Cup"" in Qatar. ""What was presented to us shows that they are going forward not only today but have already started months ago with the problems with labour and workers. The labour laws will be amended and are already in the process of being amended.""
The Qatari authorities insist they are being proactive and say the World Cup can be a catalyst for change."

Please speak up',"Mr Zidane and Mr Guardiola,
My name is Zahir Belounis and I am a French professional footballer.
After a legal dispute with my club, I am being prevented from returning home to France.
I haven't seen my family in France since June 2012 because my employer refuses to give me the exit visa needed to leave the country. This is a special document that only exists in this country and Saudi Arabia.
I am not alone in this predicament. Many workers who are to build the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup risk finding themselves in the same situation as me.
When someone suggested that I write to you, I figured that you have been great footballers but also great men so I would appeal to you to use your renown to intervene, or try to intervene, to end the impasse.
I know that you have many demands for your time but I ask you to please help me. Please understand that I am a victim.
I know that you served as ambassadors for Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid. You did this with good intentions but the reality is that if Qatar does not scrap its ""exit visa"" system, then there will be hundreds, maybe thousands, of people trapped here.
Before these problems I was a happy man in Doha. My two daughters were born here and I know that many Qataris are working hard to make this an unforgettable World Cup and I am sure that it will be! The Middle East deserves to host this global event because it is a unique way to bring people together to enjoy a fraternal celebration between nations. On the other hand, and in spite of all the good things that I could say about this country that has a sincere desire to do great things, I have been living a nightmare for several months because of the kafala system. This system is slowly killing me and many other people risk suffering in the same way. I am well placed to speak about it because I am completely bound up in it, so I take this opportunity to demand change for a better world 
I ask you to use your influence as football ambassadors to talk about what is happening to me and what is happening to many other young men here in Qatar. People are being kept far from their countries because of the exit visa system. This system should not exist and we need people like you, who love sport and its [good] image, to make our voices heard.
You know what it is like to have children. Imagine what I am going through every day in a house that is half-empty  because when they promised me that they would give me my exit visa, I sold my furniture  and when I see the look in my daughters' eyes, I feel ashamed, I feel disgusted with myself for inflicting such conditions on them.
I speak to you as fathers and as former footballers and I ask you, please speak up and do what you can to help me get home.
Kind regards,
Zahir Belounis"

The 33-year-old has not been allowed back to France since June 2012 because he has been embroiled in a legal dispute with his former club al-Jaish, who play in the Qatar Stars League, over two years' unpaid wages.
Under the kafala system that ties employees to their ""sponsors"", migrant workers cannot leave the Gulf state unless their employer agrees and Belounis has been left in limbo in Doha with his wife and two daughters. In the letter to Zidane and Guardiola, who were both active ambassadors for the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, Belounis says he has been ""living a nightmare"" in recent months due to a system that is ""slowly killing me"". He warns that ""hundreds if not thousands"" of others are suffering the same way and appeals to them as ""fathers and former footballers"" to do all they can to help him escape Qatar.
""I know that you served as ambassadors for Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid,"" said Belounis in his open letter. ""You did this with good intentions but the reality is that if Qatar does not scrap its 'exit visa' system, then there will be hundreds, maybe thousands, of people trapped here.""
Belounis acknowledges the commitment of those trying to organise the World Cup, which is likely to be moved to the winter to avoid the unsafe summer heat, and says the Middle East deserves to host the tournament. But he adds: ""I ask you to use your influence as football ambassadors to talk about what is happening to me and what is happening to many other young men here in Qatar.""
The global players' union, Fifpro, has said that Belounis had been forced to sell most of his possessions and it would forward an emergency payment from its hardship fund. Belounis said: ""People are being kept far from their countries because of the exit visa system. This system should not exist and we need people like you, who love sport and its [good] image, to make our voices heard.""
The intervention of the French embassy has not been enough to persuade the club to grant Belounis an exit visa. He believed he would be allowed to return home last weekend after signing a document giving up his claim to the unpaid wages but he was then asked to sign another document, which he believed could lead to him being charged with defamation and the imposition of a travel ban. He refused, believing that could leave him confined to Qatar for as long as the case took to be heard, which could be years.
Belounis, who has met France's president, François Hollande, over his ordeal, began legal action against al?Jaish in February last year, claiming that money due to him from a new contract signed in 2010 had not been paid.
Fifpro this week wrote to Sepp Blatter, who visited Qatar last weekend, urging the Fifa president to intervene. It said it remained ""deeply concerned"" about Belounis's ""precarious situation"".
But on Thursday Fifa said it could do nothing to help Belounis because he had lodged a legal claim in the Qatar courts rather than taking the ""second option available"" of referring the matter to its dispute resolution chamber. Despite saying: ""Fifa fully respects basic human rights and also requests that its member associations and the hosts of its events respect them,"" it said it was ""unable to intervene"". Fifpro said it was aware of ""many more players and coaches"" who were in a similar position in Qatar.
Zidane, the former world footballer of the year who is now a coach at Real Madrid, is believed to have been paid almost £2m to be an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup bid and helped revive the campaign at a crucial time following a Fifa technical report that flagged up concerns about logistics and the searing summer heat.
Guardiola, the Bayern Munich manager, played in Qatar for two years towards the end of his career and is thought to have played a key role in deepening the ties between the country's investment arm and his former club Barcelona. The Catalan club ditched their long-standing policy of shunning a shirt sponsor in favour of a deal with the Qatar Foundation and then Qatar Air. The Qatar 2022 bid team spent millions on ambassadors who also included the former Holland midfielder Ronald de Boer as part of an unprecedented spending spree to secure the World Cup in December 2010.
James Masters, a CNN reporter who has helped publicise the plight of Belounis, said this week that the player was close to suicide over the situation he had found himself in. Human rights organisations have warned that the kafala system that has left Belounis trapped in Doha has also contributed to the suffering of migrant workers in the construction sector, with the International Trade Union Congress claiming that up to 4,000 could die before the World Cup kicks off in 2022.
In his letter, Belounis says: ""I am not alone in this predicament. Many workers who are to build the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup risk finding themselves in the same situation as me.""
Many migrant workers are forced to sign away their claim to unpaid wages before being allowed to leave the country. A Guardian investigation showing that dozens of immigrant Nepalese workers had died in recent months alone in conditions akin to ""modern day slavery"" forced Blatter to address the issue last month.
But after last weekend meeting with the Emir of Qatar and the World Cup 2022 Supreme Committee, which includes many senior government ministers, he declared that he was happy with the progress being made on the issue of workers' rights.
Belounis said he hoped that as former players and parents themselves, Zidane and Guardiola would empathise with his predicament. ""Imagine what I am going through every day in a house that is half-empty  because when they promised me that they would give me my exit visa, I sold my furniture  and when I see the look in my daughters' eyes, I feel ashamed, I feel disgusted with myself for inflicting such conditions on them.""
The Qatar Football Association has denied Belounis's claims, saying that it had helped him recover unpaid wages when he played for another club in the country but that he had never lodged a complaint about al-Jaish."

The small, affluent Gulf state may seem an odd choice for one of former Prime Minister Julia Gillards first international visits.
She is going to speak at a global summit on education, part of Qatars concerted effort to present itself as progressive on the world stage. But as a former Australian leader and representative of the Australian labour movement, Gillard should take care that her presence in Qatar is not used to burnish the reputation of her host.
The image Qatar seeks to promote is at odds with the reality on the ground. As the Guardians investigative reporting recently revealed, nowhere is this more evident than the way Qatar treats its rapidly growing migrant worker population.
Winning the bid to host the World Cup has transformed Qatars physical landscape and significantly increased the already huge number of migrant workers in the country. Only 10% of the countrys population of two million are Qatari nationals. Hundreds of thousands more migrant workers have been brought in to build gleaming new stadiums and hotels to host millions of tourists.
However, Qatars archaic labour system places workers in all sectors at risk of serious human rights abuses, including forced labour. Gillard will enter a country where passports are confiscated upon arrival for the vast majority of the population. Migrant workers are encumbered by exorbitant recruitment fees, workers are tied to one employer by the highly exploitative kafala (sponsorship) system, and trade unions are banned. Adding to their vulnerability, migrant workers must obtain an exit visa from their sponsor in order to leave Qatar.
In Australia, a single death on a work site is a tragedy that will make the national news. In Qatar, sadly, such deaths are all too common. As Human Rights Watch and the Guardian have both revealed, hundreds of workers leave in coffins every year, with many succumbing to apparent cardiac arrest in a country where temperatures regularly exceed 40 degrees in the summer months and the work day typically goes beyond 12 hours, six days a week.
Construction workers are not the only workers who face serious abuses. Under Gillards leadership, Australia played a leading role in drafting the ILO domestic workers convention, so she will surely be disturbed to find out that Qatari domestic workers dont have basic protections under Qatari labour law, endure abysmally low wages and typically work without a day of rest. Some face serious physical, sexual and psychological abuse.
Despite an unprecedented level of international criticism this last month about the way Qatar treats its migrant workers, the Qatari authorities have yet to indicate how they plan to address the problem. Gillard arrives in Qatar at a time when the country faces a critical decision. It can either properly institute much-needed reform, or it can bury its head in the sand and hope that short-term PR-friendly initiatives will be sufficient to deflect international criticism.
In March, Gillard made a strong, impassioned statement, saying: No to slavery  That is not a world we will accept  Not here. Not overseas. Not anywhere. Some migrant workers in Qatar clearly work in situations that can be categorized as slavery. Gillard would do well to share with Qatari officials some positive models of what the Australian government has done to protect workers rights.
Silence on the plight of migrant workers may inadvertently play into the Qatari governments charm offensive campaign. Playing along with this campaign would be of no service to Gillard or to Australia."

Peter Giesel, a film-maker and the head of a Munich-based production company, and his cameraman Robin Ahne were detained for 27 hours after filming the working conditions of labourers from the balcony of the Mercure Grand hotel in Doha.
The pair were following up on the Guardian's investigation into the conditions endured by many of the 1.2 million migrant workers who have flooded into the country to fuel a £100bn-plus construction boom before the football tournament.
""They said they just wanted to talk to us, but it wasn't clear about what,"" Giesel told the Guardian. ""But the interrogations went on for several hours and then the security police got involved. They were talking about us sparking a riot by talking to the workers  and that's why we got detained and put in jail.""
The pair, who say they were treated well while in custody, were told their equipment was being confiscated as they had been filming without permission.
""We went to the Nepalese embassy and it was flooded with workers trying to get their passports and documents back,"" Giesel said. ""They tried to manipulate some of the footage and erase some. We weren't finished with the shooting in general, but afterwards I didn't have the nerve for it any more.""
Documents obtained from the Nepalese embassy in Doha revealed last month that at least 44 Nepalese migrant labourers died between 4 June and 8 August, more than half from heart attacks, heart failure or workplace accidents.
International trade unions said up to 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked in 2022 if nothing was done to improve conditions for the workers, many of whom are heavily in debt and tied to their employers by law.
The Qatar 2022 supreme committee, which is overseeing preparations for the World Cup and has senior representatives from all the key government departments to ensure it is aligned with a parallel 2030 masterplan, has promised to take the issue of worker's rights seriously.
Before a key meeting of the Fifa executive committee in Zurich this month, the supreme committee chief executive, Hassan al-Thawadi, said the tournament would not be ""built on the blood of innocents"".
Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, said he would visit the recently appointed emir to discuss the issue, but drew criticism from campaign groups for promising that the World Cup would go ahead regardless and claiming there was ""plenty of time"" to resolve any problems.
The International Trade Union Confederation called the Qatari response to an international outcry over the issue ""weak and disappointing"".
Giesel and Ahne were seized and held on 3 October, at exactly the same time as Fifa's executive committee was discussing the issue in Zurich.
The pair were released after friends and family got in touch with the German embassy in Qatar, prompting the German government's human rights commissioner to get involved.
Giesel said they had been treated well and even invited back to Qatar. ""They were explaining, saying we know everything's not right in our country,"" he said. ""But I think I should go back one day, just to make sure they didn't fool around with us too much and that what's been said in public there is in some way true. I can't say I will go back, but I might go back.""
The footage shot by the German broadcasters has been acquired by Sky Sports News.
Last week an 18-strong delegation from the Building and Wood Workers' International union claimed they had been denied access to a construction site when they stopped as part of a surprise inspection visit.
The group was attempting to examine conditions on a construction site at Lusail, an area 44 miles north of Doha where an entire new city is being built including the stadium that will host the 2022 World Cup final."

In the wake of a Guardian investigation that showed dozens of Nepalese had been killed in recent weeks alone and warnings from unions that the death toll could reach 4,000 before a ball is kicked if conditions do not improve, the chief executive of the Qatar 2022 supreme committee said the issue was their ""top priority"".
""This is not a World Cup being built on the blood of innocents. That is unacceptable to anybody and most definitely to ourselves,"" said Thawadi, who was in Zurich to deliver a progress report on the country's preparations.
The focus of a meeting of Fifa's executive committee was expected to be the shift of the 2022 World Cup to winter to avoid the searing heat of the summer, but Fifa insiders said the renewed pressure over workers' rights had changed the terms of the debate.
Unions protested outside Fifa House and called on world football's governing body to do more to pressure the Qatar government on the issue. The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, is expected to address the topic on Friday at the conclusion of the two-day meeting.
Thawadi pointed to a workers' rights charter drawn up by the Qatar 2022 supreme committee and said it had been working with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty on the issue for some time.
He insisted that the decision to bring the World Cup to the Middle East for the first time would accelerate progress in improving the rights of the migrant workers who are fuelling the rapid development of the infrastructure required.
""It's important to note this is an issue the government itself is looking into  and the government was looking into this before the World Cup came on board,"" said Thawadi.
""It's not a matter of the World Cup imposing pressure, that's not the case. If the World Cup is doing anything it is accelerating a number of these initiatives.""
Thawadi insisted there was no prospect of Qatar being stripped of the World Cup over the issue.
""In terms of the migrant workers  when it comes to World Cup 2022 in particular  we've established strategy, a charter. This is out in public, we have established a worker welfare committee,"" he said.
""We are looking at provisions for our contractors and we are in dialogue with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to look at not only the contracts but the mechanisms to enforce them.""
Trade union organisations have argued that while there are laws in place in Qatar to deal with the mistreatment of migrant workers, many of whom are tied to their employer and unable to leave the country, they are too rarely enforced.
""From our point of view it's plain and simple. We want to ensure the safety, health, security and dignity of everybody,"" said Thawadi.
""That's what we are moving forward to and everybody is on board in terms of that road map and that agenda and is committed to delivering that. It will always be our top priority.""
Human Rights Watch has called on Fifa to take practical, positive steps to ensure there is a legacy for migrant workers from the Qatar World Cup.
Nicholas McGeehan, a Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Fifa should insist on a timetable for labour reform for all construction workers in Qatar, offer technical and medical assistance to the Qataris on the issue of heat-related deaths and abolish the exit visa system that has caused workers to be trapped in the country.
""For all the controversy over Qatar's selection to host the 2022 tournament, the scrutiny and pressure that the Qatari authorities are now under after the Guardian's reporting make genuine labour reform a possibility,"" he said."

UK firms have secured contracts to oversee more than $20bn (£12bn) worth of building projects in the runup to the 2022 tournament, but researchers investigating maltreatment of migrant workers have reported some are reluctant to challenge malpractice and instead prioritise pleasing their Qatari clients.
Following a trade drive backed by the government, British builders have forged a dominant position advising on construction projects in Qatar, which are expected to employ as many as 1.5 million migrant workers over the next eight years. They include the builder Mace and consultant EC Harris, which have together won a contract worth £72m to help build infrastructure; the engineer Arup and the architect Zaha Hadid, which are involved in the £2.5bn project to build nine stadiums; Balfour Beatty, which has a subsidiary building a £1bn motorway; and WSP, which is working on a vast new ""Airport City"" for 200,000 people.
Following warnings from international trade unions that as many as 4,000 migrant workers could die in Qatar before a ball is kicked unless working practices are reformed, several firms have pledged to use their influence to improve safety standards and living conditions that have led workers to die from falls, traffic accidents, dehydration and exhaustion.
But an on-the-ground investigation of Qatar's building industry this summer has concluded some are not doing enough.
Jill Wells, a former construction specialist at the International Labour Organisation who is drafting a report on the problems for the non-governmental organisation Engineers Against Poverty, said that despite advances in the fair treatment of workers in the UK, British consultants appear to be wary of proposing improvements to their Qatari clients. ""The British companies that are advising and managing projects on behalf of government clients in Qatar are aware of the problems of late payment of workers at the bottom of the supply chain,"" Wells said. She said the worst abuses appeared to be occurring with labourers hired by myriad small building companies from countries including India, Lebanon and Egypt.
""But they "" could do more, for example, to ensure that their clients are aware of the importance of prompt payment and of finding ways to make sure that the funds needed to pay the workers do get down to the subcontractors on time. One contractor told us all the advisers want to do is please their clients, but they should take more responsibility for workers' welfare when managing projects."" Late payment can trap workers, meaning they feel obliged to work on unsafe sites for punishing hours and can lead to hunger and exhaustion, campaigners warned.
A spokesperson for UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), the government's export promotion arm, said that while the UK construction industry could be proud of having one of the best health and safety records in the world, ""UKTI advises and expects UK firms operating abroad to obey all local laws and employment regulations"".
UKTI through the British embassy in Doha, has campaigned for British companies to win work in Qatar with predictions of contracts worth $64bn (£40bn) up for grabs between 2014 and 2016. It has promised businesses direct support from David Cameron to win contracts, and the prime minister hosted the Emir of Qatar at Downing Street in January.
Britain also has high-level influence with Qatar through the royal family. Prince Charles persuaded the former emir to scrap plans for a £3bn redevelopment of Chelsea Barracks in London.
Asked to comment directly on the safety of workers on projects in Qatar, several firms declined. Arup said that ""as designers we do not employ or award construction contracts in Qatar  therefore, any comment from us would be uninformed speculation""."" It added: ""Around the globe, Arup is firmly committed to adhering to all the relevant labour, safety and ethical standards.""
Mace said: ""We cannot make any statements or responses on behalf of the joint venture,"" but added: ""It is simply unacceptable for people to get hurt while at work.""
Other firms said the revelation of abusive conditions for migrant workers would prompt them to use their positions to influence a change.
A spokesperson for the practice of the architect Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, who is designing the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority headquarters and a visitor centre at the new airport among other projects in the kingdom, said: ""We are involved in projects in Qatar and are disturbed by recent reports in the Guardian, and produced by the International Trade Union Confederation, about the number of construction-related deaths.
""We will be discussing working conditions with our clients in the region as soon as we can, and reviewing what we, as building designers, can do to help.""
""The conditions referenced in the ITUC's report are appalling and we will continue to use our position in the Qatar supply chain to influence high standards of health & and safety,"" said Paul Dollin, executive director at WSP Group.
A spokesman for EC Harris said: ""We were concerned by reports of the poor conditions experienced by some migrant workers in Qatar and fully support the authorities' response to improving labour conditions in those camps affected.""
""Health and safety and the conditions of workers on the projects that we are involved in is of utmost importance to EC Harris and shall never be compromised to further commercial, financial or operational gain,"" he said.
""Where we find instances of poor practice, we work with our clients and partners to ensure that immediate steps are taken to improve standards and meet industry regulations.""
Balfour Beatty declined to comment."

had the eyes of the world on it for very different reasons. The team bidding for the 2022 World Cup had unveiled the latest moneynoobject weapon in its lavish, imaginative, improbable and ultimately successful bid to land the football tournament.
Harold Mayne-Nicholls, visiting technical inspector for governing body Fifa, had just delivered a downbeat assessment of the Qataris' chances of bringing the world's biggest sporting event to a gas-rich country the size of Yorkshire with June temperatures that often top 50C.
But then a former World Cup winner, Zinedine Zidane, was unveiled as an official ambassador and immediately lightened the mood as he spoke of football's ability to build bridges and inspire hope.
""Football is for everyone,"" the former French international and three-time world player of the year told the assembled journalists and lackeys. ""When I think of all the youth of the Middle East, what they're missing is an event like the World Cup.""
That was the pretty wrapping that surrounded compelling personal pitches to the Fifa executive, and, as the body's president, Sepp Blatter, now admits, ""political influence"" on committee members to vote for Qatar for economic reasons. The successful bidders have always insisted they broke no rules.
Given the chaotic nature of the bidding process and the lack of rigour with which it was governed, that may well turn out to be true  despite the ongoing efforts of Michael Garcia, a former US attorney for the southern district of New York, to retrospectively investigate.
It is thought that Qatar paid close to £2m to secure Zidane as a bid ambassador, plus millions more to recruit others including then Barcelona manager, Pep Guardiola, who finished his playing career in the Gulf state's professional league. At the time of its World Cup bid, Qatar needed to win credibility among the footballing community and the answer was to spend, spend, spend  on ambassadors, on overseas football development, on training academies, on youth schemes.
Zidane's unveiling was a tiny, but apt, example of the lavish spending and ambition that not only characterised the controversial 2022 bid but has been woven through an unprecedented trolley dash around world sport.
Qatar's successful attempt to host a competition for which it has never qualified is far from the only significant entrance on to the global sporting stage by this ambitious Gulf state.
This is sport as soft power, a calculated attempt to build Qatar's name through a co-ordinated series of moves to align itself with the biggest and most emotive names in world sport.
Just as it reached for the best player in the world when looking for an ambassador to join its team of expensively assembled stars, so it looked to the most famous and most feted club when looking to deepen its influence in Spain.
Chiming with their més que un club (more than a club) rhetoric, Barcelona had never had a sponsor on their famous red and blue shirts when they agreed to feature Unicef on their jerseys in a one-off deal in 2006. But in modern football, money eventually talks louder than principles.
In 2010, Qatar agreed a deal for its charitable Qatar Foundation to take over the shirt sponsorship, before a deal for Qatar Airways took effect this season that is valued at more than 30m (£25m) a season for the next three years.
In Paris, the links are stronger still. Believing the English market to be overheated, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) alighted upon Paris St Germain. Existing French trade links, actively encouraged and fostered by France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who lobbied the Uefa president, Michel Platini, to vote for Qatar, helped smooth the way.
Taking on the club in a deal worth 100m, the QIA went on to spend almost four times that in just three seasons on stars such as Zlatan Ibrahamovic and David Beckham.
An $800m (£490m) sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority, ostensibly to promote the image of the country abroad, will test Platini's cherished financial fair play rules  introduced to prevent European clubs running up huge losses but also requiring them to wean themselves off sugar daddies  to the limit.
At the same time another of Qatar's big global ""soft power"" projects was making significant incursions into sport. Al-Jazeera television, which is owned by QIA, launched BeIn Sport in France, embarking on a trolley dash for football rights that included Ligue 1, the Champions League and the European Championships.
As everyone from the multinationals bankrolling global sporting events to pay-TV platforms pouring billions into sports rights has discovered in recent decades, sport hits emotional buttons and forges deep links in a way that other investments do not.
That rationale is now informing the investment priorities of entire governments. In Qatar, which has also invested heavily in expensive property in London and elsewhere, the spending has not been confined to overseas. A steady stream of international football teams  including an England side that played Brazil in 2009  have been enticed to Doha to play exhibition matches.
The Aspire academy has state-of-the-art facilities and a slate of perfect pitches used by a procession of big European clubs including Bayern Munich and Manchester United. The academy also takes in promising players from around Africa and beyond in what its Qatari backers claim is a purely altruistic endeavour.
Having already landed the World Cup, and having failed at the shortlisting stage to reach the final cut for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, another bid for the 2024 Games is on the cards. Qatar narrowly failed to beat London to the 2017 world athletics championships.
The country's rulers insist this is more than window dressing. The former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani spoke endlessly about his desire to use sport to inspire his young nation and forge a new identity, and his newly appointed son shows every sign of following suit.
Billboards on Doha's ever-expanding road network would extol the virtues of physical exercise, while London 2012 architect Lord Coe is among those who has bought into the vision.
""It's about nation building, he sees sport as a means to inspire young people in his country and he looks at sport as something that introduces a completely different dimension,"" Coe told the Guardian in December at a lavish Doha conference on sport and development.
Asked then how all these bits of the puzzle fitted together Hassan al-Thawadi, the chief executive of the Qatar 2022 supreme committee, played down the extent to which there was a masterplan at work.
""Everything has different pieces and everyone has different goals. In the end some things are interconnected and other things aren't. It's a complicated map. Some aspects are holistic and fit the national vision. Others are private initiatives,"" he said.
But the line between private initiatives and government is inevitably blurred in a feudal monarchy. The vision is not unique to Qatar and has been pursued to a greater or lesser extent by others in the region.
See also Dubai's longstanding agreements to host global golf and tennis competitions and its push to become home to the governing bodies of world sport. See Bahrain's controversial Formula 1 grand prix. And Abu Dhabi's takeover of one of England's most famous football clubs  Manchester City  and its transformation into one of the world's richest.
But Qatar has taken the proposition to a whole new level. It has been an exercise that has brought the eyes of the world upon a tiny Gulf state.
Qatar has allied that with some of the most glamorous names in sport, from Barcelona to Beckham. But in the process of attracting the gaze of the world, it has invited global scrutiny on the means with which it is fuelling that furiously paced expansion and its priorities.
""There are big opportunities here, elevating one's presence in terms of seats at global tables and external image, but there are also risks,"" observed Stephen Greyser, emeritus professor at Havard Business School, at the Doha conference."

It was almost four months since the accident, but he was still trapped in Qatar with no money and little food. His employer had all but abandoned him and within a few weeks, the doctors would begin to discuss whether to amputate his leg.
""For everything I needed, there was nothing,"" said Bhupendra. ""I was in dire straits.""
Eighteen months earlier, Bhupendra, like thousands of other poor young Nepalese men, had sought out a job overseas. He borrowed money to afford a recruitment agent's fees and got a job as a truck driver in Qatar with a monthly salary of 1,200 riyals (about £200).
""I went to Qatar to earn money,"" explained the 33-year-old. ""I have to send my children to school and pay for my family, but I didn't have any money in Nepal.""
On 9 June 2011, Bhupendra was called out by his manager to fix a company truck that had broken down. While he was fixing the battery, another truck slammed into the back of his. Bhupendra was thrown under the vehicle he was fixing, which rolled over him, crushing his leg. Trapped under the truck, Bhupendra lost consciousness and woke up in hospital. He stayed there for three months.
When he was discharged, the hospital told Bhupendra's employer that he must stay near the hospital and be provided with assistance at all times. Instead, the company took him back to his labour camp, miles from the hospital. Initially they provided someone to help him, but they refused to take him to hospital to have his dressing changed, and instead took him to a local clinic.
""When I was discharged  the company only paid me for the 20-odd days I had worked that month, but nothing more,"" said Bhupendra. ""They didn't give me my salary. They didn't give me anything. It was a very critical situation. I was injured and my leg had become septic.""
A few months after the accident, Bhupendra's company gave him a piece of paper in English to sign. The document asked Bhupendra to agree to return to Nepal and declare he had received all his benefits. Despite his desperate situation, he refused to sign it.
""I had to return to the hospital frequently for checkups, but I didn't have money for that,"" explained Bhupendra. ""I needed money for transportation and medicine. There was no money for food.""
The hospital staff wanted to amputate Bhupendra's leg, but one doctor felt it could be saved, and after a difficult operation and many hours of physiotherapy, Bhupendra can now walk with the help of a crutch.
By this time the debt Bhupendra owed in Nepal had risen to 350,000 rupees (about £2,700) and he decided the only way to get compensation, or even afford the plane ticket home, was to take his case to court. After a series of tortuous legal battles, Bhupendra was eventually awarded significant compensation and he returned to Nepal on 29 July this year.
""Bhupendra's case illustrates both the callousness with which so many companies treat migrant workers in Qatar, but also the laborious and confusing processes which migrant workers are expected to navigate in order to get their rights,"" said James Lynch, researcher for Gulf migrants for Amnesty International.
""It took him more than two years, and enormous stamina and courage, to get the compensation he deserved, during which time he was penniless.""
Despite his ordeal, Bhupendra still believes the World Cup should be hosted in Qatar. ""It's good for the World Cup to take place in Qatar. By the time of the World Cup there will be lots of demand for construction work. Those who are going to be working during the World Cup should have proper facilities, security, they should be paid according to the hours they work, their living conditions should be good and their workplace should be safe.
But the way things are going  if the problems the workers are suffering right now are not addressed, if the lessons are not learned, people will continue to suffer. But if things are taken forward properly there may be improvements."""

As the executive committee of Fifa convened in Zurich for two days of talks including a session on Qatar's preparations for the biggest sporting event ever to be held in the Middle East, the Uefa president, Michel Platini, said he was ""much more concerned"" with allegations over the treatment of migrant workers in the Gulf state than with discussions over whether to move the tournament to winter.
The British government also renewed pressure on Qatar, with the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, saying it should be ""a precondition of the delivery of every major sports event that the very highest standards of health and safety are applied"".
Unions have warned that labour conditions in the country could result in as many as 4,000 deaths before a ball is kicked. Representatives of the families of migrant workers already killed and injured on building sites in the Gulf state called on Fifa to hand the tournament to another country, unless the Doha leadership can quickly guarantee worker safety.
Ramesh Badal, a lawyer in Kathmandu who represents Nepalese workers victimised in Qatar, including those who have lost hands and legs in construction accidents, demanded that Fifa place a deadline on Qatar by which it must prevent deaths and labour abuses. He said if it fails, the right to host the World Cup should be withdrawn.
""If Fifa applies pressure on Qatar now, then they will definitely change,"" he said. ""This is now in the hands of Fifa.""
Platini voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup and his comments are one of the clearest signs yet that Qatar could be forced to act to safeguard more than a million migrant workers erecting nine new stadiums, motorways, metro systems, railways and several hundred thousand new hotel rooms. All 25 voting members of the Fifa executive committee who will convene to discuss the issue on Thursday and Friday were contacted to make them aware of the Guardian's findings. The treatment of construction workers in Qatar has been added to the agenda on Friday in the wake of the Guardian's reports, which found 44 Nepalese workers had died in Qatar between 4 June and 8 August this year. This week the Nepalese government revealed 70 nationals had died on building sites in Qatar since the beginning of 2012. Hundreds more are thought to have been injured in falls and accidents with machinery and vehicles.
Apart from Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, who said he was ""shocked"" and ""absolutely appalled"" at the revelations about the treatment of migrant workers, none of the Fifa representatives contacted by the Guardian wanted to comment before the meeting.
The British sports minister, Robertson, told the Guardian: ""I absolutely believe sports events should be spread around the world but one of the important consequences of doing that is that those countries that receive them should comply with the basic minimum standards of care.""
The United Nations International Labour Organisation (ILO) called on Fifa to use the influence of the world's most popular sport to demand improvements in labour practices in Qatar.
""Fifa's power of persuasion is very big, bigger than the ILO, and they should use their influence,"" said Nada al-Nashif, the ILO director for the Arab states. ""If they do that we can have a safe and happy lead-up to 2022. A lot hangs in the balance. We mustn't just make a few declarations and move on.""
Platini told the Daily Telegraph: ""I'm much more concerned about that [situation with migrant workers' safety] than the discussion about summer and winter. I prefer to discuss this at the Exco than in the press.""
Qatar is spending in excess of £100bn on facilities and infrastructure before the 2022 tournament and is expected to bring in at least 500,000 more workers on top of the existing 1.2 million, including 340,000 from Nepal and more from India.
The International Trade Union Confederation wrote to the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, on Wednesday to propose a series of joint ITUC/Fifa inspections of workplaces and living quarters in Qatar to monitor the treatment and rights of workers.
""The labour inspection system in Qatar has failed, and the government's announcement would simply add some inspectors into a system that doesn't work and will not make a difference,"" said Sharan Burrow, the ITUC general secretary. ""Workers are not able to speak freely as, under the strict visa sponsorship system, employers retain their passports and they are not allowed to change jobs or leave the country without the employer's permission.""
One Nepalese worker, Bhupendra Malla Thakuri, told the Guardian he was hospitalised for three months after a truck crushed his leg and he was paid nothing for all that time, was left without adequate medical support and was forced to take his employer to court to even afford a plane ticket home.
""When I was discharged  the company only paid me for the 20-odd days I had worked that month but nothing more,"" he said. ""They didn't give me my salary. They didn't give me anything. It was a very critical situation. I was injured and my leg had become septic.""
He added: ""The failure to pay workers regularly is traumatising some of them.""
Suresh Man Shrestha, Nepal's labour secretary, said the Kathmandu government had asked the Qatari authorities ""to look into the situation of the migrant workers and to kindly stop any inhumane behaviour"".
The ability of developing countries to negotiate with Qatar about worker welfare is affected by the fact that remittance money from migrant labour is an increasingly important part of their economies. Data published on Wednesday by the World Bank revealed 25% of Nepal's economy is now derived from remittances whose value to developing countries is set to reach $540bn by 2016  a projected rise of 30% on current levels. India, which provides hundreds of thousands of workers to Qatar, currently earns more remittance money than any other country  $71bn a year."

In the courtyard of the Paradise International recruitment agency in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, Ananda Kumar Rai, a worker from Dhankuta district in the east of the country, said he was asked to pay 110,000 rupees (£680) for a job in Qatar, 40,000 rupees above the limit set by Nepal's government. His friend took the offer, but Rai knew better.
""I previously worked in Saudi Arabia for three years but only earned enough to pay off my loan,"" said Rai. ""I worked every day for three years, 11 hours a day. I only got a day off when I was sick. My salary was just 450 riyals [£74] a month.""
Their limited understanding of English means workers such as Rai often do not know what agents are making them sign. ""I can only understand 20% of what I read in English, so when the agents show me a contract, all I know is what they tell me,"" said Rai.
Many migrants do not see their contract until they reach the airport, by which time most feel it is too late to change their mind if the terms are not what they had agreed verbally. One worker, who was waiting for his contract at a departure gate, said: ""You have to trust the brokers. I have been assured that my agent will try to get me the salary he promised, but even if that does not happen, I will still go.""
Jay Khapung, the manager at Paradise International, accepts recruitment fees are often inflated, but said: ""Without benefits the local brokers do not do any work  [High fees are] not acceptable, but we are compelled to charge them to cover our costs. So what shall I do?""
He also did not deny that his company's contracts could be in Arabic and English, and not Nepalese as required by local law. ""We have a department whose job it is to explain to the workers their salary, their duty hours, the nature of their work and so on,"" he said. ""They have to trust us.""
And they do. According to Nilambar Badal, director of Migrants' Centre, which advises migrants of the risks of working overseas, ""They go without asking questions. They are not ready to listen. They just want to go. They never even bother to ask how much they will earn. And so every penny is extracted from them.""
There is widespread evidence of deceit and corruption at different stages of the recruitment process, but the authorities appear to be in denial. ""We know about these problems, and we have taken certain measures against the responsible recruitment agencies,"" said Divas Acharya, director of the department of foreign employment in Nepal. ""We are trying to do more, but we are short of staff and resources.""
In late August, Acharya's department became even more short-staffed after 17 of his officials were arrested for producing fake approval letters for Nepalese leaving for foreign employment.
""Nepal's Foreign Employment Act is a good law, but its implementation is almost non-existent,"" said Rameshwar Nepal, the director of Amnesty International in Nepal. ""No action has been taken against any of the major components of the act. They are unwilling and complacent. The recruitment agents have very good links with officials and politicians.""
Bal Bahadur Tamang, the president of the Nepal Association of Foreign Employment Agencies, an umbrella body representing recruitment agencies, admits there are close ties between politicians and recruitment agencies, but says these are necessary.
""All local agents and about 60% of recruitment agencies in Kathmandu have direct political involvement,"" said Tamang, ""but we need these in order to improve the recruitment process.
""I want to make recruitment ethical, but many recruitment agencies don't, and they are in the majority. The agencies who give out contracts at the airport are unprofessional, and as for the problems of overcharging, we are working on this.""
Officials at the Foreign Employment Promotion Board (FEPB), which is chaired by the minister for labour and employment, have admitted that a fund they administer to provide welfare to migrant workers has a surplus of more than $18m. The fund was established to provide compensation to the families of migrants who died abroad, and those who have been injured at work, as well as to provide migrants with awareness and skills training before they leave.
However, despite the appalling exploitation of workers, the surplus in the fund has increased from about $7m in 2010. ""In the past year, we provided financial support to 726 families whose relatives have died,"" said Girija Sharma, the acting director of the FEPB. ""We have also provided extra staff to a number of embassies, and in the future we may use the money to help migrants reintegrate into society.""
However, Rameshwar Nepal of Amnesty said very few migrants know that help is available. ""According to our research, 95% of migrants are completely unaware of the fund. However, this money could be used for the welfare of migrant workers, for example to rescue those in trouble in the Gulf, and it could provide them with low-interest loans."""

Fifteen have died this year, according to a death toll announced by Nepal government representatives in Doha. It is the clearest official data yet on the dangers facing 1.2 million migrant workers in the Gulf kingdom during the $100bn (£62bn)construction drive before the World Cup and came as David Cameron called on Qatar's leadership to take action. He said zero deaths on the London 2012 Olypmics project showed Doha ""it can be done"".
Nepalese trade unions said many of the fatalities were caused by workers without proper safety equipment toppling from the upper floors of buildings.
The death toll was released at a joint press conference held by the governments of Nepal and Qatar, at which they denied Guardian reports about brutal working conditions, long hours, lack of food and pay and squalid living quarters facing Nepalese workers.
Mohammad Ramadan, a legal adviser working for Nepali nationals in Qatar, claimed all Nepali workers were ""safe and fully respected"" but he cited data from the Nepal embassy, which revealed that 20% of the 276 Nepalis who died in Qatar last year were killed on building sites. The rest died of natural causes and in accidents not at the workplace. This year 151 Nepalis have died, one in 10 on building sites. Sources said workers had also been killed walking on Doha's congested roads and from heat exhaustion and dehydration.
There are 340,000 Nepali workers in Qatar and if the mortality rate was extrapolated across all migrant workers it would suggest that more than 200 foreign workers could have died on Qatari building sites since the start of 2012.
""This reminds us of the industrial revolution 150 years ago,"" said Sharan Burrow, secretary general of the International Trade Union Confederation. ""Young healthy men are being worked to death in Qatar. Scores are dying from heat exhaustion and dehydration after 12-hour shifts in blazing heat, often during the night in the squalid and cramped labour camps with no ventilation and appalling hygiene.""
Last week the Guardian reported that documents showed 44 Nepalese workers died in Qatar between 4 June and 8 August this year, and that more than half died of heart attacks, heart failure or workplace accidents. It said evidence of exploitation and abuses pointed to ""modern-day slavery, as defined by the International Labour Organisation"".
Ali bin Samikh Al-Marri, chairman of Qatar's national human rights committee, said information cited by the Guardian was false and the numbers exaggerated.
""There is no slavery or forced labour in Qatar,"" he said. ""There have been some problems, owing to the fact that there are 44,000 businesses in the country. But I can assure you that the authorities are constantly making efforts to resolve the problems.""
The joint press conference came 48 hours before a Fifa executive discussion in Zurich on workers' safety on 2022 World Cup projects, and three days after Nepal withdrew its ambassador to Qatar. She had previously described Qatar as an ""open jail"" for Nepalis who suffer labour abuses.
Nepal has the second-largest migrant workforce in Qatar after India and its economy relies heavily on money sent home by its migrant workers. In 2012 the World Bank calculated that remittances accounted for 22% of Nepal's entire economic output and the figure is rising.
Bishnu Rimal, Gulf co-ordinator of the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions, said workers' deaths ruin families in Nepal who rely on remittances and were deeply distressing, with repatriation of bodies taking as long as three weeks.
""Qatar should enforce its own labour inspection system,"" he said.
Qatar's minister of labour, Saleh al-Khulaifi, said on Sunday that the Gulf state would recruit more inspectors to mount raids and checks on companies to ensure they complied with labour laws and hired more interpreters to speed up the handling of complaints from foreign workers, as part of what the ITUC said was ""a major damage-limitation exercise"".
In Manchester on Tuesday Cameron urged the Qataris to improve their safety record. ""My message is that they ought to insist on better,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We, in the Olympics, I think I'm right in saying, managed to build that entire Olympic Park with the best ever record on safety  no one dying during construction, keeping injuries to an absolute minimum. It can be done."""

The prime minister said the Gulf state could learn from the UK's example when it was preparing for the 2012 London Olympics.
""My message is that they ought to insist on better,"" Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We, in the Olympics, I think I'm right in saying, managed to build that entire Olympic Park with the best ever record on safety  no one dying during construction, keeping injuries to an absolute minimum. It can be done. The British construction industry we really can hold up as a good example to the rest of the world.""
He said the British building industry had not had such a good record in the past but that ""everyone has a duty to insist on the best safety standards"".
The International Trade Union Confederation has warned that at least 4,000 migrant workers could die in the construction frenzy leading up to the 2022 World Cup. At least $100bn (£60bn) will be spent on up to nine football stadiums, a new airport complete with a separate terminal for the Emir, a highway to Bahrain, a railway and metro network and 29 new hotels.
From 4 June to 8 August this year, 44 Nepalese workers died, about half from heart failure or accidents. On Monday Qatar responded to the Guardian reports by pledging to crack down on private building companies who exploit migrant workers.
The labour minister, Saleh al-Khulaifi, said the Gulf state would recruit more inspectors to mount raids and checks on companies to ensure they complied with labour laws and hire more interpreters to speed up the treatment of complaints from foreign workers.
International union leaders have described the response as ""extremely weak and disappointing"", amid concerns that Qatar's labour ministry may not be in full control of the pre-World Cup building programme and that the separate Qatar 2022 supreme committee is more influential. Human Rights Watch welcomed the move but called for prosecutions to create a deterrent effect.
Fifa's executive committee is due to meet this week in Zurich, where it will consider the impact of allegations of abuse of foreign labour in Qatar.

Qatari labour minister Saleh al-Khulaifi said the Gulf state would recruit more inspectors to mount raids and checks on companies to ensure they comply with labour laws and hire more interpreters to speed up the treatment of complaints from foreign workers.
The move, announced on Monday, is the clearest admission yet from a senior official of serious problems in Qatar's handling of its 1.2 million migrant labourers. It follows warnings that unless Qatar's punishing labour system is changed, at least 4,000 workers could die before a ball is kicked at the World Cup.
Al-Khulaifi said Qatar took allegations of maltreatment very seriously, and told reporters: ""We will not hesitate to take necessary action to protect the rights of [the] expatriate workforce.""
His remarks followed a review that pointed blame at contracting companies who recruit migrant workers from across south Asia to toil on a huge range of building projects as the gas-rich kingdom ploughs more than $20bn (£12bn) a year into new infrastructure.
The boom will see at least $100bn spent on up to nine football stadiums, a new airport complete with a separate terminal for the Emir, a highway to Bahrain, a railway and metro network and 29 new hotels. One of the biggest projects is an entire new city, Lusail, which is scheduled to host the World Cup final.
From 4 June to 8 August this year, 44 Nepalese workers died, about half from heart failure or accidents.
Workers have described being forced to work in 50C heat without a supply of drinking water by employers who withhold salaries for several months and retain passports to prevent workers from leaving the country. Endemic sickness and hunger in overcrowded and insanitary quarters has been reported.
The pro-government Peninsula newspaper reported: ""The ministry takes the issues of labourers very seriously. The inspection of contracting companies is going on to check how they are dealing with their workers. Companies are under scrutiny to make them comply with the provisions of the labour law regarding health, safety, accommodation and salaries, among others.""
But an official employed by the Nepali government as a legal adviser for Nepali nationals told a news conference on Monday the reports of ill-treatment were false, Reuters reported.
""We deny all that is mentioned in these false reports, and ask the bodies that publish them not to use Nepali workers as a means to achieve their inappropriate targets and agendas,"" Mohammad Ramadan said.
""We also stress that all Nepali workers are safe and fully respected,"" Ramadan said.
Citing Nepali embassy figures, Ramadan said 276 Nepalis died in Qatar last year, of which 20% were on work sites. The rest died of natural causes and in accidents not at the workplace, he said.
Ali al-Marri, the chairman of Qatar's National Human Rights Committee, an official state body, told the same news conference: ""The numbers published by the media differ greatly from the actual numbers.""
Fifa's executive committee is due to meet this week in Zurich, where it will consider the impact of allegations of abuse of foreign labour in Qatar on World Cup preparations. Pressure has been growing on Fifa and Qatar to act, with FifaPro, the global alliance of professional footballers' unions, saying last week it was deeply alarmed at the deaths of workers.
But there is concern that Qatar's labour ministry may not be in full control of the pre-World Cup building programme and that the separate Qatar 2022 supreme committee is more influential. On Monday night, the response was attacked by international union leaders as ""extremely weak and disappointing"".
The International Trade Union Confederation said the promised raids and checks did nothing to abolish the Qatari system which strips migrant workers of their passports, renders them powerless to complain about conditions, and traps them in Qatar, unable to leave.
""They already have labour inspectors and they have no impact,"" said Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the ITUC, who has previously met the Qatari labour minister for talks in Geneva on the issue. ""What is needed are laws that protect workers' rights to join a union, bargain collectively and refuse unsafe work, and only then can inspectors do their job.
""As it stands, there are laws that give employers total control over workers so no worker will feel able to speak to a labour inspector.""
Human Rights Watch, the New York-based group which produced a June 2012 report that found ""pervasive employer exploitation and abuse of workers in Qatar's construction industry,"" welcomed the move but called for prosecutions to create a deterrent effect and ""end the culture of impunity"". ""This is an unprecedented acknowledgement of the problem from an official body in Qatar and I don't think we have heard anything like this from any labour ministry in the Gulf,"" said Nicholas McGeehan, Gulf researcher for HRW. ""They have to be prepared to criminally sanction Qatari employers and they must not scapegoat non-Qatari companies at the bottom of the food chain. An increase in inspections is necessary and a step forward, but there needs to be legal reforms to end the 'kafalah' system, which binds workers to one employer.""
India revealed over the weekend that 41 of its nationals in Qatar died over the summer, 27 of them in August, the hottest month of the year when daytime temperatures hovered in the mid to high 40s. The Indian embassy said on its website that more than 230 nationals had died in Qatar in each of the past three years, although it did not provide a complete breakdown of the causes of death. Some died of natural causes, others in road accidents.

Azfar Khan, the ILO's senior labour migration adviser in the Arab states, told the Guardian that despite pledges to do otherwise Qatar did not properly inspect workplace conditions and there was ""no coherence"" in the state's policies over the use of migrant labour.
""The onus is on the Qataris if they have ratified the convention to better implement it,"" he said. ""Many of the abuses that take place which can lead to forced labour are still happening.""
Qatar became a signatory to the ILO convention on the abolition of forced labour in 2007.
The ILO's criticism follows the Guardian's exposure of 44 deaths among Nepalese workers from 4 June to 8 August and warnings from unions that more than 4,000 migrant workers could die between now and 2022 unless punishing working schedules and squalid living conditions are radically overhauled.
There are already an estimated 1.2 million migrant workers in Qatar, mostly builders, and the country is expected to ship in at least 500,000 more as construction accelerates in preparation for the world's biggest sporting event.
On Friday, the international footballers' union, Fifpro, said it was ""deeply alarmed by reports of the brutal exploitation of migrant workers by construction companies in Qatar who are involved in building the stadia that Fifpro members will be expected to play in"".
The umbrella organisation for players' unions, which represents more than 50,000 footballers around the world from Lionel Messi to Wayne Rooney, called for independent workplace experts appointed by Fifa and the ILO to be given access to all sites and powers to make binding recommendations to ensure international labour standards are respected in Qatar.
""If these reports are true, then football must act,"" said Brendan Schwab, the chairman of the Asia division of Fifpro. ""It is inexcusable for workers' lives to be sacrificed. Fifa has previously acted to ensure international labour standards are respected when it worked with the ILO in the fight against child labour in the manufacture of footballs. A similar initiative is urgently needed in Qatar.""
The ILO has previously sent high-level missions to address workplace deaths, such as when the Rana garment factory collapsed in Dhaka in April claiming 1,127 lives.
As well as regular deaths from workplace accidents and heart failure, the Guardian reported that migrant workers in Qatar had been denied access to free drinking water in extreme heat, had been unpaid for months and had had their passports confiscated to prevent them from leaving the country  in effect enslaving them.
The ILO's criticism is significant as Khan has been working closely with the Qataris for the past two years and Qatar's 2022 organising committee has said it enjoys ""an open channel of dialogue with the ILO on these issues"".
The UN organisation was invited to assess the country's labour practices when it secured the 2022 World Cup. Khan found that while the written laws were largely adequate, in practice there was no proper schedule of building site inspections, no consistent paperwork containing criteria by which to assess conditions and inspectors were not properly trained.
The International Trade Union Confederation has calculated that about 400 Indian and Nepali migrant workers die in Qatar every year and the toll could rise to at least 600 a year as more migrants arrive to help build 12 football stadiums, additional hotels, new rail and subway networks, and a new city to house 200,000 residents, all at a cost expected to exceed $100bn.
The British law firm Leigh Day is taking steps to bring legal actions in the London courts against any UK firms found to be working on construction projects where labour laws are being breached.
""We are investigating a number of construction projects in Qatar where it is alleged abuses of migrant workers have taken place,"" said Nichola Marshall, a lawyer at the firm. ""A key concern is to what extent UK contractors and consultants are involved in those projects.""
Many leading British architects have produced stadium designs for Qatar that are yet to begin construction. Lord Foster's firm drew up concept plans for the 86,000-seat Lusail stadium, which will host the World Cup final. Zaha Hadid has been appointed to design the al-Wakrah stadium. Foster's firm declined to comment on labour conditions in the state while Hadid's office did not respond to questions.
A key reason for Qatar's alleged failure to meet its international obligations is the system of ""kafalah"" that requires foreign workers to be sponsored by an individual to work in Qatar, the ILO believes.
It translates as ""adoption"" or ""guardianship"" and historically referred to Arab principles of hospitality where foreign visitors would come under the protection of their hosts. In a globalised labour market it has come to mean a system where passports, and sometimes wages, are withheld by employers, making it impossible for workers to leave while workers are charged fees as high as $3,500 to obtain a visa from the ""kafeel"" or sponsor.
Sources who have investigated Qatar's labour markets told the Guardian hundreds of unlicensed labour agents were operating in the emirate supplying workers from their home countries  largely Nepal and India.
They interact with another layer of middlemen  the sponsors or kafeels who are able to supply work visas. It is understood that some labour agents pay kafeels as much as $500 per visa, in effect a kickback from the fee the labour agent charges the worker for their visa, which the worker raises by borrowing or selling assets in their home country.
""As far as the ILO is concerned, it is untenable in the context of modern labour standards,"" Khan said.
He added he was worried about a lack of ""coherence in terms of policy"" and ambiguity over whether the ministry of labour is overseeing work conditions on pre-World Cup projects or whether it is the supreme committee of Qatar."

In November 2010, when Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, it was clear that a failure to make basic reforms would result in the sort of brutal exploitation revealed in Pete Pattison's outstanding investigative report.
In June 2012, Human Rights Watch issued a damning report on human rights abuses, including forced labour, in Qatar's construction sector. Earlier this year, we concluded that the country risks becoming ""a crucible of exploitation and misery"" for migrant workers after the authorities chose to ignore the detailed recommendations in that report. Other rights groups and trade unions have been similarly critical.
The bad news is that we are looking at a serious and entirely predictable problem that could get significantly worse. Estimates of Qatar's total population run from 1.7 to 2 million, and hundreds of thousands of migrant workers continue to pour in annually to meet the demands of its booming construction industry. One need spend only a few hours in the industrial area of Salwa, in the western outskirts of Doha, home to many of its migrant workers, to appreciate that Qatar is not prepared for this influx.
The good news is that this problem can be fixed. Qatar needs to enforce its good laws, such as prohibiting employers from confiscating passports and banning illegal recruitment fees. It should reform or abolish its bad laws, such as the notorious kafala system of sponsorship-based employment and an exit visa system that gives employers unchecked power to stop workers from leaving the country.
The cumulative effect of these mutually reinforcing mechanisms facilitates forced labour and leads to the dreadful living and working conditions we see in Qatar today. The country is wealthy enough to solve problems many times as complex, and in any case, the issue is less about money than about the impulse to control a non-citizen workforce that today constitutes 90% of the population.
The difficult part lies in convincing Qatari opponents of labour reform that it is necessary. The powerful business community is not alone in opposing more rights for migrant workers. A recent survey from Qatar University's social and economic survey research institute found that 88% of Qataris sampled did not want the kafala system reformed, and 30% wanted it strengthened.
Of equal concern is the responsible authorities' refusal to acknowledge the gravity of the problem. The ministry of labour told Human Rights Watch in 2012 that it was ""inconceivable"" that forced labour existed in Qatar, despite compelling evidence to the contrary.
In this context, the positive response of Qatar's 2022 supreme committee to the Guardian's findings  its members said they were appalled in a statement  offers some hope. Hassan al-Thawadi, the committee's secretary general, has made repeated commitments to labour reform, but his powers and remit are limited. The supreme committee's plans to address the migrant worker problem by issuing a code of conduct for building work related to the World Cup won't address the overarching structural problems.
This issue requires bold leadership right from the top. Sheikh Tamim, Qatar's new emir, has much to gain from taking a strong line on labour rights and empowering Qatar's reformers to take the steps required to end forced labour in the country. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out what will happen if he doesn't."

The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) said at least half a million extra workers from countries including Nepal, India and Sri Lanka were expected to flood in to Qatar to complete stadiums, hotels and infrastructure. Unless the Doha government made urgent reforms to working conditions the death toll among migrant builders could reach 600 a year, or almost a dozen a week, the ITUC said.
The stark warning came after a Guardian investigation revealed that 44 Nepalese workers died from 4 June to 8 August this year, about half from heart failure or workplace accidents. Workers described being forced to work in 50C heat without a supply of drinking water by employers who withhold salaries for several months and retain their passports to prevent them leaving the country. The investigation found sickness is endemic among workers living in overcrowded and insanitary conditions, and hunger has been reported.
A representative on the board of Fifa, which controversially awarded the world's biggest sporting event to Qatar in 2010, called for an urgent inquiry by the world governing body. Fifa announced it will discuss the issue at a meeting of its executive committee in Zurich next week and a spokesman said it was ""very concerned about the reports presented by the media regarding labour rights' abuses and the conditions for construction workers"".
A spokesman for Qatar's World Cup organisers said they were ""appalled"" by the Guardian revelations and said there was ""no excuse"" for the maltreatment of workers. In London, Tory MP Damian Collins said England and other major footballing nations should consider boycotting the World Cup if Fifa does not show it is taking concerns surrounding the Qatar 2022 tournament seriously.
The problem of workers' deaths is not confined to Nepalese migrants who make up 16% of Qatar's 1.2 million migrant labour force. The Indian ambassador in Qatar said 82 Indian workers died in the first five months of this year and 1,460 complained to the embassy about labour conditions and consular problems. More than 700 Indian workers died in Qatar between 2010 and 2012.
""Nothing of any substance is being done by the Qatar authorities on this issue,"" said Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the Brussels-based ITUC. It has met the Qatari labour minister in Geneva and officials at the Qatar 2022 supreme committee. ""The evidence-based assessment of the mortality rate of migrant workers in Qatar shows that at least one worker on average per day is dying. In the absence of real measures to tackle that and an increase in 50% of the migrant workforce, there will be a concominant increase in deaths.""
The ITUC has based the estimate on current mortality figures for Nepalese and Indian workers who form a large part of Qatar's migrant workforce, the majority of whom are builders. While it admits that the cause of death is not clear for many of the deceased  with autopsies often not being conducted and routine attribution to heart failure  it believes harsh and dangerous conditions at work and cramped and squalid living quarters are to blame.
""We are absolutely convinced they are dying because of conditions of work and life,"" said Burrow. ""Everything the Guardian has found out accords with the information we have gathered from visits to Qatar and Nepal  The 2022 World Cup is a very high-profile event and should be implemented with the very highest standards and that is clearly not the case.""
The Nepalese government on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Qatar after she caused a series of diplomatic incidents, which drew complaints from both the Nepali and Qatari authorities.
In an interview with the BBC earlier this year, ambassador Maya Kumari Sharma said Qatar was an ""open jail"" for Nepalese migrants. Her post had been under threat for some time. According to local media reports, earlier this week a senior Nepali politician called for her dismissal, following a request from the Qatari ambassador to Nepal.
There were wider calls in Kathmandu for Nepal's government to do more to defend its people working in the Gulf.
""What we now want to see is an increase in human capacity at Nepal's embassy in Qatar to deal with the huge numbers of workers seeking help, and an increase in resources so that the embassy can provide shelter, food and, if necessary, air tickets back to Nepal,"" said Rameshwar Nepal, director of Amnesty International Nepal.
Last month 30 migrant workers took refuge in the embassy."

'appalled and disturbed',"A representative on Fifa's ruling executive committee has said he is appalled and disturbed by the findings of a Guardian investigation into the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar before the 2022 World Cup and vowed to push for immediate action by football's governing body.
Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, a Fifa vice-president, called for an immediate investigation into the deaths of dozens of Nepalese workers and the ill-treatment of thousands of others working in Qatar in an £85bn construction frenzy as the country prepares to host the tournament.
""I was appalled and very disturbed after reading the allegations in the newspaper this morning. Fifa must investigate this information immediately and report the full findings at the earliest opportunity to the Fifa executive committee,"" he said.
Boyce, who reiterated that he was ""absolutely appalled"", took over from the former Football Association chairman Geoff Thompson as the representative of the home nations on the 24-strong Fifa executive committee immediately after the vote that controversially awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in December 2010.
The executive committee is convening in Zurich next Thursday for a two-day meeting that will include a debate about the timing of the 2022 tournament. There is growing demand to move it from summer to winter in order to avoid the 50C heat, but this has outraged defeated rival bidders, such as the US and Australia, and European leagues that play in winter.
It is understood that discussion of the findings of the Guardian investigation, which included evidence of forced labour on the huge Lusail City project that will have the World Cup final stadium as its centrepiece, could be added to the agenda.
The Qatar 2022 supreme committee, responsible for the ambitious project to host the world's biggest sporting event in a country smaller than the Falkland Islands and in scorching summer temperatures, said it too was appalled by the details contained in the report and an accompanying film.
""Like everyone viewing the video and images, and reading the accompanying texts, we are appalled by the findings presented in the Guardian's report. There is no excuse for any worker in Qatar, or anywhere else, to be treated in this manner,"" said a spokesman.
""The health, safety, wellbeing and dignity of every worker that contributes to staging the 2022 Fifa World Cup is of the utmost importance to our committee and we are committed to ensuring that the event serves as a catalyst toward creating sustainable improvements to the lives of all workers in Qatar.""
The World Cup organisers have promised to hold all contractors due to work on the construction of the actual stadiums to a new code of conduct.
But critics of a system that has been likened to modern-day slavery point out that Qatar already has more robust labour laws than many other countries in the region, but they are often not adhered to by the web of contractors and subcontractors in a huge construction boom with tens of thousands of migrant labourers who are tied to their employer by law.
Meanwhile, the British government has offered to assist Qatar and other hosts of large sporting events to share the lessons of ensuring the ""safety and security"" of the construction of the venues and infrastructure for the 2012 Olympics.
""London 2012 had an outstanding record on safety and security both during the construction phase and when the Games were on,"" said the sports minister, Hugh Robertson.
""We stand ready to help with lessons learned and share best practice with future host cities and countries of major international sporting events. It's also vital that international sports organisations remain vigilant and ensure that their selected hosts' safety and security plans are completely robust.""
The International Trade Union Confederation this week wrote to the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, to revisit the bid conditions for the 2022 World Cup to protect migrant workers.
It pointed out that in 2011 the Fifa secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, issued a statement in which he said: ""Fifa upholds the respect for human rights and the application of international norms of behaviour as a principle and part of all our activities.""
Tory MP Damian Collins, who has long campaigned for reform of Fifa, has said England and other nations should consider boycotting the World Cup if Fifa does not show it is taking concerns surrounding the Qatar tournament seriously.
He said Fifa should take a ""very active interest"" in preparations in Qatar, including ""any construction work linked to the infrastructure and stadia"".
In light of grave concerns about the treatment of migrant workers, and the debate about when the tournament should be played given the summer heat, he said football authorities should consider withdrawing from Fifa tournaments.
""I do wonder whether the FA should seriously consider whether the questions over it being moved, over human rights and over the huge disruption to the sporting calendar are so great that we should consider not playing,"" said Collins, who sought to form an international coalition of politicians to campaign for the reform of Fifa in the wake of corruption allegations that engulfed the organisation in 2011.
""Fifa only understands and respects money, so the only power the FAs have is to withhold from Fifa tournaments. If there are outstanding concerns over the calendar and human rights there should be a very serious debate about whether to play in the World Cup.""
Collins said he was also concerned that the voice of Uefa, the European football governing body, was ""not as strong as it should be"" on the issue. Its president, Michel Platini, was one of those who voted for Qatar to host the 2022 tournament.
""These are serious issues. The Qataris have said they take this very seriously and so should we. Fifa should look like it is busting a gut to make sure it is protecting the rights of the workers who are providing the stage for its tournament,"" he said.
The English FA and Uefa declined to comment.
Fifa said it would contact the organisers in Qatar before addressing the issue at its next executive committee meeting in Zurich on Thursday and Friday next week.
""Fifa is very concerned about the reports presented by the media regarding labour rights abuses and the conditions for construction workers in projects at Lusail City, Qatar,"" it said in a statement.
The room KK sleeps in every night, which measures about three metres by four, would be small enough if he slept in it alone. In fact he shares it with 11 other men, and because of Qatar's searing temperatures, whenever they are not at work, the room is packed with bodies.
""The air conditioner doesn't even work properly,"" said KK, pointing to the rattling machine in the corner.
His room is part of a rundown compound filled with migrant workers from across the region. Next door is a room full of Sri Lankans on one side and on another a group of Egyptians. It is not what KK imagined when he left his home in Nepal to earn enough to feed his extended family.
He had been promised a job as a carpenter earning 1200 rials a month with 300 rials for food, but instead he was being paid just 900 rials and had been put to work as a plumber.
Every day KK gets up before dawn to go to work, but even at this hour the humidity is draining.
In order to pay the recruitment brokers to get this job in Qatar, KK had taken out a loan but that loan which gave him the freedom to leave Nepal, was now binding him to Qatar.
""I'm upset, but what can I do? I have so many expenses, I have a wife and a whole family to look after,"" he said. ""I've got no choice, I have to stay here to pay off my debt.""
At the end of an eight-hour shift, KK returns to his room dripping in sweat, but there are no bathrooms to wash in, just a bucket of water over an open latrine. And with the searing heat there is nothing to do but return to his cramped room.
""Those in Nepal who want to come here need to confirm everything in their contract before they leave,"" warned KK. ""I confirmed everything but when I arrived here I found it hadn't been confirmed here. That recruitment broker had lied to me. This is the reality.""
Pete Pattisson
In 1980, Qatar was a country of 200,000 people, making it one of the smallest in the world, but it has changed rapidly, largely because of immigration.
In terms of rights, migrants might not be powerful  but they are great in number. Figures show the number of Qataris in work is 71,076, and there are 1,199,107 non-Qatari workers, so immigrants make up 94% of Qatar's workforce, and 70% of its total population.
The website Peoplemovin, which pulls together data from the World Bank, estimates that in 2011, 22% of migrants came from India, 22% from Pakistan, 16% from Nepal and 13% from Iran. Only a handful of those migrants make it into skilled jobs, the Qatari census data shows. The vast majority have moved into urban areas, reducing the percentage of the population in rural areas from 10.6% in 1980 to 4.2% now.
Most of those migrants are men, which goes some way to explain why three out of every four residents in Qatar are male. This has had a big effect on the age and gender of Qatar's population, as these classic population pyramids demonstrate. Qatar's demography was quite gender-balanced back in the 1950s. By 2010, there was a bulge in the number of 25- to 35-year-olds and far more men than women. Mona Chalabi"

The group has been scrutinising builders' deaths in the Gulf emirate for the past two years and said that at least half a million extra workers from countries including Nepal, India and Sri Lanka are expected to flood in to complete stadiums, hotels and infrastructure in time for the World Cup kickoff.
The annual death toll among those working on building sites could rise to 600 a year  almost a dozen a week  unless the Doha government makes urgent reforms, it says.
The ITUC has based the estimate on current mortality figures for Nepalese and Indian workers who form the bulk of Qatar's 1.2 million-strong migrant workforce, the large majority of whom are builders.
While it admits that the cause of death is not clear for many of the deceased  with autopsies often not being conducted and routine attribution to heart failure  it believes harsh and dangerous conditions at work and cramped and squalid living quarters are to blame.
The stark warning came after a Guardian investigation revealed that 44 Nepalese workers died from 4 June-8 August this year, about half from heart failure or workplace accidents.
Workers described forced labour in 50C heat, employers who retain salaries for several months and passports making it impossible for them to leave and being denied free drinking water. The investigation found sickness is endemic among workers living in overcrowded and insanitary conditions and hunger has been reported. Thirty Nepalese construction workers took refuge in the their country's embassy and subsequently left the country, after they claimed they received no pay.
The Indian ambassador in Qatar said 82 Indian workers died in the first five months of this year and 1,460 complained to the embassy about labour conditions and consular problems. More than 700 Indian workers died in Qatar between 2010 and 2012.
Without changes to working practices, more workers will die building the infrastructure in the runup to the World Cup than players will take to the field, the ITUC has warned. ""Nothing of any substance is being done by the Qatar authorities on this issue,"" said Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the Brussels-based organisation that has met the Qatari labour minister in Geneva and officials at the Qatar 2022 supreme committee, which is preparing the country for the World Cup.
""The evidence-based assessment of the mortality rate of migrant workers in Qatar shows that at least one worker on average per day is dying. In the absence of real measures to tackle that and an increase in 50% of the migrant workforce, there will be a concominant increase in deaths.
""We are absolutely convinced they are dying because of conditions of work and life. Everything the Guardian has found out accords with the information we have gathered from visits to Qatar and Nepal. There are harrowing testimonies from the workers in the system there. The 2022 World Cup is a very high profile event and should be implemented with the very highest standards and that is clearly not the case.""
It is estimated that Qatar, the world's richest country by income per capita, is spending the equivalent of £62bn from its gas and oil wealth on building transport infrastructure, hotels, stadiums and other facilities ahead of the World Cup.
The ITUC has estimated the number of migrant workers already in Qatar at over 1.2 million and says possibly as many as 1 million more will be needed to get the country ready for the world's biggest sporting event. ""Fifa needs to send a very strong and clear message to Qatar that it will not allow the World Cup to be delivered on the back of a system of modern slavery that is the reality for hundreds of thousands of migrant workers there today,"" said Burrow.
The ITUC's own analysis of deaths this summer appears to tally with the Guardian's investigation. It found that 32 Nepalese workers died in July, many of them young men in their 20s. ""Nepal accounts for less than half the migrant workers in Qatar, and reports from other countries-of-origin indicate that similar numbers of workers from these countries are losing their lives in Qatar,"" Burrow said.
Asked to comment on the prediction of thousands of deaths, a spokesman for the Qatar 2022 supreme committee said on Thursday that organisers were ""appalled"" by the the Guardian's revelations about the deaths of Nepalese workers who travelled to the Gulf state to work.
""Like everyone viewing the video and images, and reading the accompanying texts, we are appalled by the findings presented in the Guardian's report,"" the spokesman said. ""There is no excuse for any worker in Qatar, or anywhere else, to be treated in this manner.
""The health, safety, wellbeing and dignity of every worker that contributes to staging the 2022 Fifa World Cup is of the utmost importance to our committee and we are committed to ensuring that the event serves as a catalyst toward creating sustainable improvements to the lives of all workers in Qatar.""
A leading expert in labour migration to the Gulf from south Asia warned Qatar that ill-treatment of workers would backfire because the labour forces they rely on to build their economies will start resisting.
Prof S Irudaya Rajan, chairman of the research unit on international migration at the centre for development studies in Kerala, India, said: ""They need people from India and Nepal to give their hard work and they need better treatment because they are the ones building their whole economy.
""The Qataris have made them invisible in their economy but they have to make them visible. In the 21st century, labour should be treated equally to capital.""
Rajan said he believed Indian workers were better treated than some others because the relatively long history of the country sending workers to the Gulf means support networks are already in place for them.
This article was amended on 26 September 2013. The name of the International Trade Union Confederation was given wrongly as the International Trade Union Congress. This has been corrected."

That workers should be so abused in preparation for the Gulf state's 2022 World Cup is sad, yet comes as no surprise. That they are dying at a rate of almost one a day  more than half of them from heart attacks, heart failure and workplace accidents  in the construction binge, in temperatures of up to 50C, is terrible. But what really shocks is the thought that the whole sordid system of debt bondage and forced labour is legal.
Under the kafala sponsorship system which requires all unskilled labourers to have a sponsor, migrant workers are unable to enter the country, leave it or change jobs without their company's permission. The Nepalese working at Lusail City are double-locked into bondage. Unable to pay the debts to the middlemen who recruited them, they are forced to work without pay. But once in Qatar, their fate is sealed by subcontractors who confiscate their passports, refuse to issue them with ID cards, and hold back their pay for months to stop them fleeing. If they do, they are reduced to the status of illegal aliens, sheltering in their embassy, demanding protection.
Qatar is not the only outpost of Dante's Inferno, try as it might to hide behind its image of a glitzy, hyper-wealthy, postmodern, liberal state. Forced labour is a recurrent issue in the world of globalised business: 21m people across the globe toil in these conditions. Where you have no rule of law, institutional discrimination and a vulnerable workforce, you have modern-day slavery. While there are UN principles  those developed by the special rapporteur John Ruggie are as good as any  there is no international law holding companies responsible for labour conditions offered by their subcontractors. The principle of extraterritorial legislation is contained in the UK's Bribery Act, but there is a hesitancy about applying to the same rules to slavery. Theresa May's promise to introduce a modern slavery bill tightening the laws on human trafficking in the current session of parliament is welcome. So is the creation of a commissioner to ensure that government and law enforcement agencies work together. But no British company working abroad that finds its supply chain polluted by forced labour will be subject to any legal sanction. The same presumably goes for our footballers.
Britain has a long history of fighting slavery, but all bets are off when it comes to a government department, aid agency or company operating abroad. Why else would the UK give Uzbekistan, which forces thousands of adults and children to pick cotton, favoured trading status?"

Two months later he was dead","Amid the urgent bustle of Kathmandu airport, you can see one of globalisation's most bitter sights. At the departure gate, hopeful parents bid tearful farewells to their garlanded sons as they join the hundreds of thousands of Nepalese heading overseas for work. At the other end of the terminal, among the stream of passengers emerging through arrivals, the coffins of migrant workers are wheeled out on luggage trolleys to be collected by families. Some relatives are stoic, others wail and writhe on the floor. On average, three or four bodies arrive home every day.
These are the big losers of scandalous abuse and exploitation of some of the poorest, most disenfranchised people on the planet: the workers who leave Nepal for the Middle East every year.
Ganesh Bishwakarma was one such worker. For Ganesh, Qatar was an oasis in the desert, a promised land where he could work his way out of the acute poverty that had trapped his family in Nepal's rural Dang district for generations. Like many others in his village he had met the recruitment agents who promised well paid work and the opportunity to provide for his family. He left pledging to come back and build his mother a beautiful house.
He did return  after only two months and in a coffin. He was 16.
""We didn't think he would die like this,"" said his grandmother, Motikala. ""We didn't think we would be crying like this.""
It was late at night when the ambulance carrying Ganesh's body pulled up outside his family's small mud house. The wailing of his friends and neighbours started long before his coffin was unloaded and carried back home by his shocked and grieving family. All night his family crouched around the child's coffin. As dawn broke, they said their final farewells and lit his funeral pyre.
At 16, Ganesh was too young to have legally migrated for work, but that did not stop a local recruitment broker arranging a fake passport stating he was 20. The broker charged an extortionate fee for a cleaning job in Qatar  far in excess of the legal limit set by the Nepalese government  leaving the boy and his family with a 150,000-rupee (£940) recruitment debt that he promised to pay back at an interest rate of 36%.
Every year, almost 400,000 Nepalese men and women leave their towns and villages for jobs overseas. More than 100,000 head to Qatar, where a booming construction industry and insatiable appetite for cheap labour has been fuelled by its successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup, celebrated by the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani and his wife, pictured below. Yet instead of the salaries and prospects they have been promised, many of these workers are led into a web of exploitation, corruption and deceit and, increasingly, slavery and death.
For many of these migrants, their fate is sealed before they have left Nepal. ""[Nepalese migrant workers] go without asking questions,"" said Nilambar Badal, director of the Migrants' Centre in Nepal, which advises migrants of the risks of working overseas. ""And so every penny is extracted from them.""
While construction of the stadiums is yet to start, Qatar is already a giant building site as it prepares for the World Cup. Construction sites can range from vast chasms crawling with thousands of workers, to a handful of men building a villa. What doesn't change is the relentless heat and humidity. Workers on most sites toil away in pale blue boilersuits stained dark by their sweat. They wrap themselves up, even draping their faces in cloth to shield them from the sun. Often only their eyes are visible.
Ten miles from the centre of Doha, workers are toiling under a searing sun on the Lusail City development. By 2022, this huge building site will be Qatar's gleaming new metropolis and a centrepiece of Qatar's World Cup tournament. Yet there is mounting evidence to suggest it is being built in part on the forced labour of men who find themselves powerless to leave  their wages retained to stop them running away, their passports confiscated and deprived of the ID cards they need to move around freely without fear of arrest.
Some workers at Lusail City say they have not been paid for months and can only watch as the interest mounts on their debts in Nepal. One group finally took strike action to demand their wages, a drastic step given that the authorities can simply expel them to penury and shame back at home for the most minor infraction.
""The situation has become so bad that we have had to go on strike three or four times to demand our salary,"" said SBD, a Nepalese migrant who works on Lusail's marina. ""Once we stole the keys from the buses which take us to work so they could not force us to go. We've gone to the police, but they refused to help us.""
An hour's drive away, a vast dusty industrial zone west of Doha is home to tens of thousands of migrant workers. Temperatures can reach up to 50C, with labourers working up to 12 hours a day, yet the men who have been put to work for a sub-contractor claim they are not supplied with drinking water.
At night they return to filthy and overcrowded accommodation in the Sanaya industrial centre, where the stench of raw sewage is overpowering and workers allege 600 men share two kitchens. ""The kitchens are infested with mosquitoes, cockroaches and bugs,"" said KBB, one of the camp's residents. ""Flies are sitting on the food. People are getting sick.""
The appalling toll on migrant labourers building the infrastructure for the World Cup is reflected right across Qatar's construction sector.
In a tiny room behind the Nepalese embassy, the Guardian found dozens of migrant workers seeking rescue and redress from their employers. ""When my two-year contract finished, I asked my employer to let me go home. He kept promising to issue me with an exit permit and send me home, but he never did,"" said Bir Bahadur Lama, 25, who has been trying to return to Nepal for a year. ""Last year my employer sold me to another man, but when he realised I was an undocumented worker, he fired me. My only option now is to turn myself in to the police, and hope that they'll deport me.""
One large group sought refuge after their employer had allegedly paid no wages for months at a time. They said he was now refusing to issue the exit permits they needed to return home.
""We do not want to leave our money behind, but we are risking our lives by staying here. It is not worth it,"" said Ramesh Kumar Bishwakarma, 32, who has not been paid for 10 months. ""Just give us a ticket and our passports. We want to leave as fast as possible.""
For an increasing number of migrants, their only way out of Qatar is in a coffin. Mortality rates among Nepalese workers have risen over the past few years. Nepal's foreign employment promotion board (FEPB) estimates that 726 migrants died overseas in 2012, an 11% increase on the previous year.
Migrant rights group Pravasi Nepali Co-ordination Committee (PNCC) said the real number of deaths was likely to be double this as the FEPB's figures include only those where a relative claimed compensation or insurance money. It put the death toll closer to 1,300. ""The number of deaths among Nepalese migrants is much higher than other south Asian countries,"" said Mahendra Pandey, the chair of PNCC. ""Most Nepalese work in construction, but they are not experienced at this type of work, which is much more risky than other jobs. They also often find they are not being paid a good salary which led some to commit suicide.""
The most common cause of death given on forms is some form of heart failure. There is confusion over why so many apparently healthy young men are dying of cardiac arrest  so much so that these deaths are now commonly referred to as ""sudden death syndrome"".
""These workers who are dying are young, but heart attacks are not a common cause of death among young people,"" said Dr Prakash Raj Regmi, president of the Nepal Heart Foundation, who points to the appalling working and living conditions these workers endure as a possible cause, saying: ""These men have poor eating habits, high levels of mental stress and work long hours in extreme conditions.""
Ganesh's family was told the boy died of a cardiac arrest weeks after he arrived in Qatar. It is something the family finds hard to accept. ""This son of mine was strong. He didn't even have a cough,"" said his father, Tilak Bahadur. ""He went abroad and died unexpectedly. Was it the climate or something else?""
The Nepalese government seems unwilling to act against mounting evidence of the labour abuses faced by thousands of its citizens. It blames the recruitment agencies, which it accuses of conning vulnerable workers into bogus contracts and inflated recruitment fees.
""We know about these problems, and we have taken certain measures against the responsible agencies,"" said Divas Acharya, director of the department of foreign employment in Nepal. ""We are trying to do more, but we are short of staff and resources.""
For Ganesh's family, the hope they felt two months ago as their boy left for Qatar has turned into uncertainty and despair. As the flames from the funeral pyre started to die down, his father's thoughts turned to the debt that Ganesh had left behind. Despite his son's hopes of returning home a rich man, the family never received a rupee from Qatar.
""I don't know how I am going to pay back the loan we took out to pay for my son's job. It is on my mind the whole time. I know the lender won't spare me,"" he said. ""I don't ever want to hear the name of Qatar again.""
For most of the thousands of migrant workers who flock to the Middle East, their problems originate at home, with unscrupulous recruitment agents who often impose high fees for finding them a job and make false promises about salaries and contract terms.
The more ruthless will fake documents, including health certificates, to make their ""clients"" seem fitter for work than they really are. The poorer migrants will usually have to borrow money  often at steep rates  from moneylenders or other people in their village to pay their way.
Once in Qatar, the kafala system binds the worker to a single employer. Workers have little scope to complain about malpractice, such as confiscation of passport, late payment of wages and failure to issue ID cards, because the employer knows his labourers depend on him. Kafala requires employers to report workers who quit without permission for ""absconding"", an offence leading to their detention and deportation. It also requires workers to secure exit permits from their employer before they can go abroad.
""We can't run away and we can't change company,"" said an electrician working at the new international airport. ""If we run away the police may catch us  we are afraid of them. We will become illegal.""
According to the International Labour Organisation, forced labour is ""all work which is exacted from someone under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily"".
The ILO's checklist specifies a range of conditions that are the hallmarks of forced labour. The Nepalese allegations tick many of these boxes, including physical violence, exclusion from community, removal of rights and privileges, worsening of working conditions, the withholding of wages, retention of identity documents, and induced indebtedness.
Human Rights Watch said: ""The sponsorship law prohibits migrant workers from changing jobs without their employer's consent; even when employers fail to pay competitive wages, provide decent conditions, or meet the conditions of the employment contract, workers cannot simply change jobs."""

thousands more are enduring appalling labour abuses, a Guardian investigation has found, raising serious questions about Qatars preparations to host the 2022 World Cup.
This summer, Nepalese workers died at a rate of almost one a day in Qatar, many of them young men who had sudden heart attacks. The investigation found evidence to suggest that thousands of Nepalese, who make up the single largest group of labourers in Qatar, face exploitation and abuses that amount to modern-day slavery, as defined by the International Labour Organisation, during a building binge paving the way for 2022.
According to documents obtained from the Nepalese embassy in Doha, at least 44 workers died between 4 June and 8 August. More than half died of heart attacks, heart failure or workplace accidents.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
The investigation also reveals:
Evidence of forced labour on a huge World Cup infrastructure project.
Some Nepalese men have alleged that they have not been paid for months and have had their salaries retained to stop them running away.
Some workers on other sites say employers routinely confiscate passports and refuse to issue ID cards, in effect reducing them to the status of illegal aliens.
Some labourers say they have been denied access to free drinking water in the desert heat.
About 30 Nepalese sought refuge at their embassy in Doha to escape the brutal conditions of their employment.
The allegations suggest a chain of exploitation leading from poor Nepalese villages to Qatari leaders. The overall picture is of one of the richest nations exploiting one of the poorest to get ready for the worlds most popular sporting tournament.
Wed like to leave, but the company wont let us, said one Nepalese migrant employed at Lusail City development, a $45bn (£28bn) city being built from scratch which will include the 90,000-seater stadium that will host the World Cup final. Im angry about how this company is treating us, but were helpless. I regret coming here, but what to do? We were compelled to come just to make a living, but weve had no luck.
The body tasked with organising the World Cup, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, told the Guardian that work had yet to begin on projects directly related to the World Cup. However, it said it was deeply concerned with the allegations that have been made against certain contractors/sub-contractors working on Lusail Citys construction site and considers this issue to be of the utmost seriousness. It added: We have been informed that the relevant government authorities are conducting an investigation into the allegations.
The Guardians investigation also found men throughout the wider Qatari construction industry sleeping 12 to a room in places and getting sick through repulsive conditions in filthy hostels. Some say they have been forced to work without pay and left begging for food.
We were working on an empty stomach for 24 hours; 12 hours work and then no food all night, said Ram Kumar Mahara, 27. When I complained, my manager assaulted me, kicked me out of the labour camp I lived in and refused to pay me anything. I had to beg for food from other workers.
Almost all migrant workers have huge debts from Nepal, accrued in order to pay recruitment agents for their jobs. The obligation to repay these debts, combined with the non-payment of wages, confiscation of documents and inability of workers to leave their place of work, constitute forced labour, a form of modern-day slavery estimated to affect up to 21 million people across the globe. So entrenched is this exploitation that the Nepalese ambassador to Qatar, Maya Kumari Sharma, recently described the emirate as an open jail.
The evidence uncovered by the Guardian is clear proof of the use of systematic forced labour in Qatar, said Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, which was founded in 1839. In fact, these working conditions and the astonishing number of deaths of vulnerable workers go beyond forced labour to the slavery of old where human beings were treated as objects. There is no longer a risk that the World Cup might be built on forced labour. It is already happening.
Qatar has the highest ratio of migrant workers to domestic population in the world: more than 90% of the workforce are immigrants and the country is expected to recruit up to 1.5 million more labourers to build the stadiums, roads, ports and hotels needed for the tournament. Nepalese account for about 40% of migrant labourers in Qatar. More than 100,000 Nepalese left for the emirate last year.
The murky system of recruitment brokers in Asia and labour contractors in Qatar leaves them vulnerable to exploitation. The supreme committee has insisted that decent labour standards will be set for all World Cup contracts, but underneath it a complex web of project managers, construction firms and labour suppliers, employment contractors and recruitment agents operate.
According to some estimates, Qatar will spend $100bn on infrastructure projects to support the World Cup. As well as nine state-of-the-art stadiums, the country has committed to $20bn worth of new roads, $4bn for a causeway connecting Qatar to Bahrain, $24bn for a high-speed rail network, and 55,000 hotel rooms to accommodate visiting fans and has almost completed a new airport.
The World Cup is part of an even bigger programme of construction in Qatar designed to remake the tiny desert kingdom over the next two decades. Qatar has yet to start building stadiums for 2022, but has embarked on the big infrastructure projects likesuch as Lusail City that, according to the US project managers, Parsons, will play a major role during the 2022 Fifa World Cup. The British engineering company Halcrow, part of the CH2M Hill group, is a lead consultant on the Lusail project responsible for infrastructure design and construction supervision. CH2M Hill was recently appointed the official programme management consultant to the supreme committee. It says it has a zero tolerance policy for the use of forced labour and other human trafficking practices.
Halcrow said: Our supervision role of specific construction packages ensures adherence to site contract regulation for health, safety and environment. The terms of employment of a contractors labour force is not under our direct purview.
Some Nepalese working at Lusail City tell desperate stories. They are saddled with huge debts they are paying back at interest rates of up to 36%, yet say they are forced to work without pay.
The company has kept two months salary from each of us to stop us running away, said one man who gave his name as SBD and who works at the Lusail City marina. SBD said he was employed by a subcontractor that supplies labourers for the project. Some workers say their subcontrator has confiscated their passports and refused to issue the ID cards they are entitled to under Qatari law. Our manager always promises hell issue [our cards] next week, added a scaffolder who said he had worked in Qatar for two years without being given an ID card.
Without official documentation, migrant workers are in effect reduced to the status of illegal aliens, often unable to leave their place of work without fear of arrest and not entitled to any legal protection. Under the state-run kafala sponsorship system, workers are also unable to change jobs or leave the country without their sponsor companys permission.
A third worker, who was equally reluctant to give his name for fear of reprisal, added: Wed like to leave, but the company wont let us. If we run away, we become illegal and that makes it hard to find another job. The police could catch us at any time and send us back home. We cant get a resident permit if we leave.
Other workers said they were forced to work long hours in temperatures of up to 50C (122F) without access to drinking water.
The Qatari labour ministry said it had strict rules governing working in the heat, the provision of labour and the prompt payment of salaries.
The ministry enforces this law through periodic inspections to ensure that workers have in fact received their wages in time. If a company does not comply with the law, the ministry applies penalties and refers the case to the judicial authorities.
Lusail Real Estate Company said: Lusail City will not tolerate breaches of labour or health and safety law. We continually instruct our contractors and their subcontractors of our expectations and their contractual obligations to both us and individual employees. The Guardian have highlighted potentially illegal activities employed by one subcontractor. We take these allegations very seriously and have referred the allegations to the appropriate authorities for investigation. Based on this investigation, we will take appropriate action against any individual or company who has found to have broken the law or contract with us.
The workers plight makes a mockery of concerns for the 2022 footballers.
Everyone is talking about the effect of Qatars extreme heat on a few hundred footballers, said Umesh Upadhyaya, general secretary of the General Federation of Nepalese Trade Unions. But they are ignoring the hardships, blood and sweat of thousands of migrant workers, who will be building the World Cup stadiums in shifts that can last eight times the length of a football match.

In its World Report 2013, HRW is expected to say workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal and other south Asian countries suffer forced labour, low pay, insanitary and overcrowded living conditions and other violations of their human rights when they arrive to work in Qatar, one of the world's richest countries.
HRW says the Qatar government has not fulfilled pledges made when Fifa awarded the World Cup to the country, to improve the conditions for workers who will build nine new stadiums and massive infrastructure projects for the tournament. Although there are concerns within the football establishment about players and supporters enduring the heat of Qatar if the tournament is played in the summer of 2022, HRW argues no similar care is being taken for the workers labouring in that summer heat every year.
HRW, which published an extensive report into workers' human rights in Qatar in June, found that some workers have to live in ""overcrowded and unsanitary labour camps"", which lacked clean water, ventilation or air-conditioning, ""crucial elements for adequately minimising the risk of heat stroke"".
Many of the 1.2 million migrant workers, who form 88% of the country's population, suffer the kafala sponsorship system, which ties them to a single employer. That means they cannot change jobs without the consent of that employer, other than in exceptional cases, and to leave Qatar they need the sponsoring employer to grant an exit visa, which can be refused. Employers ""routinely"" confiscate workers' passports, HRW says.
""Qatar has some of the most restrictive sponsorship laws in the Gulf region and forced labour and human trafficking are serious problems,"" the HRW World Report will state. ""The government has failed to address shortcomings in the legal and regulatory framework despite the initiation of many large-scale projects for Qatar's 2022 World Cup.""
Qatar's bid included commitments that the situation of workers in the country would be improved but HRW argues little progress has been made. There remains no legal right to form or join a trade union and no minimum wage. Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said that, combined with the kafala system, workers are suffering ""forced labour"" in Qatar.
""The World Cup in 2022 was awarded by Fifa to a country which treats workers as modern-day slaves,"" Burrow said. Calling on Qatar to improve its labour laws and practices, including outlawing recruitment fees charged to workers, she cited figures from the Nepal government that 200 Nepali migrant workers died last year working in Qatar. ""More workers will die building World Cup infrastructure than players will take to the field,"" Burrows predicted.
The Qatar 2022 supreme committee told the Guardian it has nearly finalised a ""migrant worker charter"" for all World Cup-related projects, that it will include labour requirements in its tender documents and work with HRW and other stakeholders to seek ""the highest health and safety and worker welfare standards to the benefit of all major projects in Qatar"".
The Qatari government, contacted via the embassy in London, did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment on the issues raised by Human Rights Watch."

cynically minded it puts a new spin on the old Mrs Merton gag. So, captains of the global sports industry, what first attracted you to the tiny oil-rich state of Qatar?
The capital, Doha, is a city of contrasts. Queues of SUVs sit gridlocked on newly built highways even as it promises to invest billions in green technology. They carry Qataris with the highest per capita earnings in the world past immigrant workers whose treatment is concerning human rights groups and fuelling a huge construction boom that is poised to accelerate towards the 2022 World Cup. It has styled itself as the most modern and progressive of the Gulf states, yet faces a struggle to forge a new identity.
Twenty minutes' drive from the capital, past endless construction sites, one can view a scale model of a whole city, Lusail, that is yet to be built and by the time of the 2022 World Cup will be home to 400,000. The government-owned company behind it, Qatari Diar, already owns the London Shard, Chelsea Barracks and the Athletes' Village at London's Olympic Park. Stop on a busy nearby roundabout and one can gaze across the sand to the point where the stadium due to host the World Cup final in less than a decade in front of 86,250 fans will stand.
Construction of the 12 stadiums required, nine of them brand new, will begin in 2014 or 2015. ""The heavy lifting is not the stadiums; it is the rest of the infrastructure. I don't see it as a challenge  I see it as a significant amount of work,"" says Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the Qatar 2022 supreme committee from his 37th floor office amid the towers of the West Bay district.
Two years on from Fifa's jaw-dropping decision to award the 2022 World Cup to a country where the furthest distance between stadiums is 70km and the temperature hits 41 degrees in the summer months, some of the cast involved on that heady day in Zürich were among those invited to the modestly titled Gathering Of All Leaders in Sport (Goals) conference in Doha. Part of an attempt to sell the strategy beneath the bling, as Qatar continues to engage in a trolley dash around world sport while simultaneously investing billions in building sports palaces at home, the two-day event was designed to demonstrate the social and economic value of its vision.
While much of the words from stage were platitudes, the hosting of an event that has pretensions to be the sporting equivalent of the Davos World Economic Forum was a statement in itself. As with the recent climate conference and its position as a go-between in delicate political negotiations, it is also part of an attempt to position Qatar as the diplomatic hub of the region. On the orders of the Emir, al-Jazeera broadcast live from the conference, while his paen to the development and educational potential of sport was on the front of every newspaper the next day.
Two of the men tightly woven into the narrative of this emirate's attempt to vault on to the world stage and position itself for a future without oil and gas were among those giving the opening speeches. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president at the centre of rumours (strenuously denied) that he encouraged the Uefa president, Michel Platini, to vote for Qatar due to France's important trade links with the country, was there. So, too, was the Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who did not vote for Qatar in Zurich but now has to make the great gamble work.
As Sarkozy claimed that Qatar sat at the nexus of many of the global challenges of the 21st century, Blatter again acclaimed the shift in the pendulum of sport away from the old European and American order. ""There are big opportunities here, elevating ones presence in terms of seats at global tables and external image, but there are also risks. I would cite the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games,"" said Harvard professor Stephen Greyser from the platform.
The World Cup is just for starters. Doha twice failed at the shortlisting stage with recent bids to host the summer Olympics. Most recently, the International Olympic Committee sprung a surprise by agreeing to a proposal to stage the Games later than usual before dropping Doha from the shortlist anyway following lobbying by TV companies over scheduling concerns. It will try again for 2024. Meanwhile members of the Royal Family or state investment arms have bought Paris St-Germain and Málaga and deepened links with Barcelona that led first to Qatar Foundation and (from next season) Qatar Air being emblazoned on the front of previously unadorned shirts.
Like South Africa, Brazil and indeed London, Qatar has embraced the idea that hosting major sporting events can turbocharge and give a focal point to infrastructure development  except that in Qatar the figures are bigger and the stakes higher. ""Qatar has a firm conviction about the importance of sport in stimulating various types of development that has led them to invest in building huge structures and sports facilities,"" said Emir Sheikh bin Khalifa al-Thani, opening the conference. He said it was ""an important element in the development drive, knowledge building and job creation, not only at a local level but due to its benefits at the regional level"".
It will spend up to £31bn on hotels, leisure, tourism, sports, recreation and other projects in the run-up to the World Cup. Reliable sources put the total figure to be invested in infrastructure over the next decade at £137bn. An entire rail network, a metro system, a new network of roads and that new city north of Doha are to be constructed over the next eight years.
Lord Coe, still on his London 2012 victory lap, met with the Emir, al-Thawadi and others involved in the Qatar's grand experiment to pass on his London experiences and bang the drum for British business. ""They have genuine motives,"" said Coe. ""It is easy to look at what you see here, the access to resources they have and the infrastructure they have. But they have looked at this and if you speak to the Emir he will tell you why they do it. It's about nation building, he sees sport as a means to inspire young people in his country and he looks at sport as something that introduces a completely different dimension. This is not year zero. It might appear like that to a lot of people.""
The Qataris do not suffer from self-doubt. That new stadium is called, without irony, the Lusail Iconic Stadium. The pace of construction is breathtaking, endlessly accelerating over the past decade.
Showing off the indoor sporting facilities beneath the Aspire Dome, and on the endless manicured football pitches outside, they explain how they run programmes to train aspiring players from African nations and their own Qatari hopefuls. They outline the school programmes that hope to find Olympic medallists and they claim that the country, despite its relative youth, has a deep love of sport and is progressing quickly on the international stage.
But by vaulting on to that stage Qatar has invited scrutiny and suspicion. It likes to project itself as one of the most moderate and progressive nations in the region. But human rights groups have warned of issues surrounding low pay, poor conditions in labour camps and the fall-out from a sponsorship system that ties migrant workers to their employers. Al-Thawadi, left, says that the World Cup, far from exacerbating the problem, will act as an agent for change. ""The World Cup is a catalyst. It will be addressed. We're making that commitment,"" he told the Guardian.
Qatar's successful World Cup campaign also sparked fevered speculation about the manner in which it was secured. All allegations of bribery and votes being linked to trade deals have been strenuously and repeatedly denied by the bidding team. But it is not in doubt that the Qataris spent unprecedented sums on a campaign that was bound by ill-focused rules with so many grey areas they were next to useless.
Al-Thawadi, who leads a fast growing multinational team, insists that he can't go on fighting battles of the past. There was bemusement from the Qataris at the allegations that came their way, claiming they stayed within the rules, had to spend big to announce their presence and put the most barbed allegations down to a disaffected ex-employee.
There are other things money alone will not solve. Qatar won the World Cup on the basis that it would be able to deal with the searing summer heat through innovative air-cooled stadiums but doubts have been cast on whether they will work on a large scale. Meanwhile a campaign started by Platini and stoked this week by Sarkozy for the tournament to move to winter, vigorously opposed by the European leagues, continues to gather pace. The Qatar 2022 organisers have consistently said they bid on the basis of hosting a summer tournament and are proceeding on that basis, but will move it if Fifa asks them to.
Ask how investments in PSG and Málaga and regular rumours about buying English clubs fit into Qatar's vision and al-Thawadi says it is a mistake to believe that there is an over-arching plan. ""Everything has different pieces and everyone has different goals. In the end some things are interconnected and other things aren't. It's a complicated map. Some aspects are holistic and fit the national vision. Others are private initiatives,"" he says, sidestepping the fact that the line between state investment and individual initiative is inevitably blurred in a feudal monarchy.
Standing in front of a huge wall displaying a flurry of plans and diagrams headed ""Programme Wide Masterplan: Stage One Draft"", al-Thawadi talks a good game. He paints a picture of a compact tournament that will allow fans from across the world to experience a new kind of World Cup. Then you remember the taxi drivers who say it is impossible to go outside in July.
Three days in this fast-growing, disorienting city go some way to convincing that the deep-pocketed Qataris might just pull off the mission impossible of building the infrastructure to host a World Cup in oppressive heat from scratch. Whether it should have ever been there in the first place is a question that will not go away until the first visitors step into their cooled ""fan zones"".

Al Jazeera reported: ""Thousands of ticket-holding fans were turned away as police imposed a lockout."" The gates were closed early to ensure a security blanket around the royals as they were ushered in, said Jassim al-Rumaihi, the tournament's operations director. Al Jazeera described how fans were confronted by riot police at the gates. ""The guy went mental on me,"" one said. ""There was blood all down my hands.""
To add insult to injury, a volunteer told the broadcaster that immigrant workers had earlier been bussed in to avoid the embarrassment of a half-empty stadium. ""The people outside the ground had tickets  they were waving them in the air. The people who were brought in were being handed balloons and flags to make them look like real fans,"" he said.
For Japan, who won 1-0, it was a victory to be celebrated, and as Asahi Shimbun noted, it ""finally healed the trauma of 'Doha no higeki'""  the tragedy of Doha, when a draw with Iraq in the city prevented the Blue Samurai from reaching the 1994 World Cup.
But it remained a disaster for Qatar, where, despite offers of refunds, Arabian Business quoted a Saudi visitor saying: ""How do they expect to organise the 2022 World Cup? They can't even organise this."" Another said: ""It was chaos. A sad experience."" But the final word, damningly, belonged to the broadcaster set up by the Emir of Qatar. ""There was confrontation for no reason,"" commented Al Jazeera. ""If they did that with slightly aggravated football fans at the World Cup there would be a riot.""
Commentators in the US were vexed last week after the comedian Bill Maher dared suggest, ahead of tonight's Super Bowl, that: ""Americans must realise what makes NFL football so great: socialism."" As he argued that its system of revenue sharing ""put all of it in a big commie pot and split it 32 ways "" was not only instructive but entertaining as well. ""You have to laugh  the same angry white males who hate Obama because he's 'redistributing wealth' just love football, a sport that succeeds economically because it does exactly that.""
""Suffice to say, anyone who finds this illuminating either hasn't thought it through or has the brains God gave trout,"" says the Washington Examiner. Maher was ""misrepresenting the truth to advance his liberal agenda,"" argues Newsbusters.org (dedicated to ""exposing and combating liberal media bias""). The Tea Party's Walter Hudson talks of ""the kind of rhetorical titty-twister Maher regards as legitimate intellectual combat"".
Maher's use of the ""S"" word seems to have riled just about everyone, the AmericanThinker.com noting: ""Bill Maher, the Hollywood Jesus-hater"" had a grasp of the NFL ""so trite that one wonders who's higher, him or Snoop Dogg"". Although the author's bio suggests his own agenda: ""Greg Halvorson is an island of conservative clarity in the liberal cesspool that is Portland, Oregon.""
... is Sports Illustrated's Peter King, who in their 2010 NFL season preview correctly picked Green Bay and Pittsburgh to meet in the Super Bowl. An extraordinary prediction, given a full season and knockout eliminators were needed to reach the game. He called the exact score as Steelers 33 Packers 27 and is sticking with the forecast."

is good, obviously,"" an eminent Qatari tells me. Obviously. ""But to be cultured, well, that's something else"" He's talking less about individuals than states, in particular his own which is now  on a per-capita basis  the richest country in the world, a status chiefly explained by Qatar possessing plenty of what the world most wants: oil and gas.
It also now has the World Cup  or will have in 2022, after Fifa's decision late last year to award the tournament to the Gulf state. The decision provoked plenty of commentary, little of it entirely complimentary.
A common response was ""Where is it?"" As for those critics who did know how to find Qatar on a map but were still not happy, they had a choice of targets from the practical (the country's extreme heat, its lack of adequate infrastructure) to the ethical (its chequered human-rights record, limited expression of opinion, indentured foreign workers).
The response within Qatar, however, was interesting. Yes, there was jubilation, but also a sense of, if not quite entitlement, then at least expectation. There was no exuberant joy and gratitude from the emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, more the contentment of someone who's getting used to winning. The Economist led a recent analysis of Qatari acquisitions and triumphs with the bald headline: ""What Cash Can Do"".
To arrive in Qatar, then, especially from a deflated west, is to feel yourself immersed in a place that wants to Go Somewhere or Be Something, and to do so very quickly. When Qatar's sovereign wealth fund goes shopping, it is apt to land the iconic likes of Harrods and Sainsbury's; it also owns large parts of a series of banks  Credit Suisse, Barclays and Santander  plus the London Stock Exchange.
But it's also to arrive in a place obsessed about being known for something beyond its untold wealth  a place that recognises that while money has its huge merits, it doesn't, as the song has it, buy you love.
Culture, however, might. And it is in this context that winning the World Cup should be viewed: against a backdrop of film festivals and new museums, of landmark architecture and its aim to be a global hub of the art market.
To become a cultural capital is the way to the world's heart, or so runs the idea. This is not a novel notion in the Gulf, where emirates bid to be taste makers; Abu Dhabi, for one, has its own versions of the Louvre and the Guggenheim.
However Qatar  mostly because of its tiny size and the speed with which it prosecutes its intentions  can make you feel that you're at the centre of a perpetual whirl of power and money.
""They are keen to have a signature that's not just the Rich Gas and Oil People. It's much more interesting to be the Culture People,"" says Amanda Palmer, an Australian broadcaster who has become something of a player in Qatar. She is the executive director of the Doha Tribeca film festival, an offshoot of the Robert De Niro-backed New York event, whose presence in Doha reflects savvy arts connections at play in Qatar.
So it is that I find myself bumping into De Niro and Kevin Spacey and Salma Hayek, lending commercial clout and glamour to the film festival. But also bumping into brilliant, if hardly mainstream, British musician Nitin Sawhney performing (alongside the Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra) his live accompaniment to the silent Indian classic A Throw of Dice. It quickly becomes clear, then, that Doha Tribeca is not just a ""trophy"" festival. There's thought and imagination at work in the programming.
Naturally, driving such events is Qatar's desire to show that it can attract world stars and their films, that it can put itself on the ""world entertainment circuit"". But it also turns out that people in prominent positions within the cultural elite, people with access to power, know, for instance who Nitin Sawney is and understand, say, the charms of TED (a non-profit worldwide cultural organisation) and they often turn out to be smart women, largely from the region.
The week I'm in Qatar, Doha also plays host to a TEDx conference, dedicated to disseminating ""ideas worth spreading"". That Doha now gives a berth to the very embodiment of high-end cultural chat is a mark of the ways in which Qatari power wants to nudge outsiders' perceptions.
So while the Qatari sovereign fund is busy pursuing establishment jewels (auction house Christie's is on the shopping list), the ruling family is also open to advice on the wisdom of hooking up with more left-field collaborators: Sheikha Mozah, one of the emir's wives, was instrumental in establishing the Doha Tribeca film festival.
Perceptions are being nudged elsewhere in town  in Education City, no less, where it is announced that University College London is to open a campus (joining several American institutions, including Georgetown University, which operate franchises in Doha). The UCL tie-up ticks two local priorities  buying in academic expertise and developing skills in the arts (archaeology, conservation and museum studies will be offered on campus).
This concerted expansion and huge investment in culture and in education provides a stark contrast with the mood back home in Britain. But the questions we have been asking ourselves (from a cash-strapped perspective in our case) are also the key questions in Doha, if for different reasons: what's an education for? What are the arts for?
Consider human rights and Qatar. In Gulf terms, Qatar is judged to have a reasonable record, though last year Amnesty International called on it to strengthen guarantees of freedom of expression and to end discrimination against women; homosexuality is illegal and sentences of flogging are still imposed. Then there are the less-than-benign conditions enjoyed by many of its foreign workers. Only 300,000 of the population are natives  the rest of the 1.7m residents are foreigners, many Asian construction workers.
Against this background, what value education, what value culture? Should those whose talents are hired, or given a forum at a film festival or educational establishment, say, consider themselves involved in a progressive act? Or are they helping Qatar look good and appear liberal?
""Well, the first thing you do is to not come and lecture,"" says Scandar Copti, film programmer at Doha Tribeca. ""You have a look around, see what can be done, learn; see if you can do some good work."" Copti, an Arab Israeli, is a figure with some clout and an impressive record. He co-directed the feature film Ajami, which was nominated for a Foreign Language Oscar in 2009; he also provoked a deal of controversy within Israel when the film began making waves by asserting that he did not ""represent"" Israel (because Israel, he said, did not ""represent"" him).
The relationship between art and society is more than a theoretical one for Copti. Two separate if parallel phenomena are in play in Qatar, he suggests. Qatar is staking its claim to be a hugely powerful cultural capital, one that gains status points by attracting notable foreigners to its blue-chip events. But remember, he counters, that in other ways this is just the beginning: as producers of culture, Qataris are, in many regards, just starting. For instance, the very first Qatari film, Clockwise  a horror film shot in the desert  was only completed last year.
To that end, in his other, educative, role at the film institute, Copti says he has visited every school in Qatar to plant the idea of filmmaking in young children's minds. They workshop aggressively, and many from the immigrant community have become regulars at the institute. (At the film festival, one of the most engaging sessions consists of a series of one-minute films from debutants, inspired by the workshops.)
Copti is also keen to set Qatar in a wider Arab context. For him, the Doha Film Institute, which hosts the film festival, is less of a national than a pan-Arabic resource. Qatar has plenty of money, but much of the Arab world has not, he explains. Just as America is the hub for English-speaking film talent, why not Doha for the Arab-speaking variety? In this scenario, Qatar becomes a place where Arab creators, in film and beyond, can find money and training.
As for restrictions on the work at the Film Institute or on the programme at the festival, this is less of a top-down affair, suggests Copti, it's more about trying to judge what will work with the locals.
Another prominent figure working in the arts points out that the ruling al-Thani family are, if anything, ahead of their population in terms of liberalising Qatar: ""The 300,000 Qataris are very comfortable, very well off and conservative; to be born Qatari is to win the lottery, at least in material terms, and there is hardly a great clamour from them for change."" This analysis casts the emir and Sheikha Mozar as involved in a sort of experiment to see what works.
""There's certainly a spirit of enquiry in the air,"" says a Qatari entrepreneur with a taste for the arts whom I meet at a fringe film event. ""And much of this comes from the top."" He adds: ""Of course, we know that these big events are designed for Qatar to make an impression on the outside world. But they also become a focus for ideas and for new thinking.""
The entrepreneur tells me that just a few years ago there was nowhere to go if you were interested in film, in performance, in discussion. ""You had private conversations, not public forums."" He sketches out for me a sort of emerging intelligentsia, not huge in numbers but who run into each other at arts-related events. ""If you're talking about how a film works, or what is and isn't funny, for instance, by extension you're perhaps extending the range of what seems possible in society,"" he says.
Later during my trip, I meet 21-year-old business student Mohammed Fahad Kamal, Qatar's leading (and quite possibly only) stand-up comedian. What do you draw on for your on-stage material, I ask him. Politics? No, he says. Religion? That'll be no, too. Sex? No again. So the essential themes of comedy across the world are verboten on a Qatari stage? Yes, but there is other stuff, promises Mohammed.
I catch up with his act later. Imagine a neurotic, impotent, railing against power; the comedy of a nebbish. And then imagine the opposite  the opposite is Mohammed's act. It's a comedy of power  his material includes a riff about driving in Doha and how native Qataris like himself, when they are seized by road rage, shout out to the other (presumed non-native) driver, ""I cancel your visa!"", a reference to the indentured-worker status of the majority of Qatar's inhabitants.
It's a comedy that's premised on how wealthy and powerful Qataris are, but delivered with charm and a sense that he knows how arrogant, absurd even, the power and wealth might seem. It's an act that's very much open to being chastised, corrected. And that's a little bit how Qatar feels at the moment. Wealthy, powerful, but in need of reassurance and correction.
Back at the film festival, Nitin Sawhney is unsure about the extent to which culture is ""opening up"" Qatar. He's still doing his research, he says, ""But there seems very little that's complacent about this place. And there's plenty to be said for that.""

This isn't an original proposition although proof of it sometimes comes in the most unexpected ways. Take the newly-minted revelation, courtesy of the Wall Street Journal, that Qatar set aside £26.5m for PR and marketing last year as it sought to persuade Fifa that the 2022 World Cup should be staged in a desert nation the size of Glasgow.
With oil heading towards $100-a-barrel and 15 billion barrels still underground waiting to be welled, that sum of money probably sounds like armchair shrapnel to a member of the Qatari ruling elite. But it's not. It is, for instance, four times the amount spent by United States on its competing bid. Australia spent a reported £25m chasing the 2022 dream  again, on its entire bid. Meanwhile, back in the cheap seats, England's two-year long, headless-chicken themed effort clocked in at £15m.
The corollary is obvious, or at least it is to the cynics and the losers who have spent the weeks since the 2022 decision complaining the competition was not judged entirely on merit. Naivety is always welcome in the corridors of power but, really  it was a Fifa bidding process. What else did they expect?
Likewise, confirmation of Qatar's outlandish spending has also been seized upon as proof that the World Cup was ""bought"" when in fact all it proves is Qatar got terrible value for its £26.5m.
Marketing and PR campaigns are supposed to persuade and convince a broad audience. They are supposed to build momentum, to turn ""why?"" into ""why not?"". On the eve of Fifa's decision there were murmurings Qatar might be coming up on the rails. It is the measure how little impact its money had made that even then no one outside the black-hearted bubble of Fifa politics took the idea of a desert World Cup seriously.
It is this dissonance between broader expectation and the eventual outcome of the Zurich vote that has fuelled the worldwide cynicism now engulfing Fifa's showcase event, and has Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini scuttling around trying to restore its credibility. How about a January World Cup? How about a ""Gulf-wide"" World Cup?
Qatar will have none of it, dismissing both ideas in recent days, and why should they? Under the terms and conditions of Fifa's bidding rules (such that they are) they won. Case closed.
As for the money they spent trying, and failing, to persuade a broader audience (as opposed to a narrow Fifa electorate), at least it is being put to use now as an army of marketing and PR men attempts to explain away revelations contained in Qatar's own bid documents.
Is it really true that when the Emirate invested heavily in academies sited in the home nations of Fifa executive committee members via its Football Dream initiative  six of the 15 countries singled out for help by Qatar (40%) were countries of Fifa execs, when executive committee members account for fewer than 12% of Fifa's 208 member associations?
""Inevitably some are in countries which are the home of committee members and many are not,"" a Qatar spokesman told the WSJ. ""At no time were they established to secure votes.""
And what of the minutes showing how Qatari officials discussed circumventing a Fifa directive telling bid countries they should not stage lobbying events during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa? ""An expression of strategic thought,"" said a spokesman. ""It did not happen.""
As for an offer to finance the relocation of the Asian Football Confederation to Qatar, lock, stock and, in the words of the documents, ""a large-sized BMW"" for the AFC president: ""We understand the AFC discussed the possibility of a move of its headquarters to Doha but this was rejected.""
It is also suggested the Qatari-owned television network Al Jazeera could bail out the financially-stricken Argentinian Football Association by buying television rights. ""It is true that our client carried out detailed due diligence on the Asociación del Fútbol Argentino, however, our client did not adopt or proceed with any steps to intervene in or assist with the financial position of it,"" lawyers for the Qatar bid told the Telegraph.
And so on, and on, and on until we return inevitably to the formulation that seems destined to echo down the years. ""The Qatar bid played within the rules laid down by Fifa at all times,"" a spokesman for the bid said.
Maybe so but until someone explains how the 2022 World Cup ended up in the desert when the case against it was, and continues to be, so lacking in credibility and public support, then all in the oil money in Qatar won't make the cynicism and the suspicion disappear.
It is convoluted case  one for the trainspotters  with an uncertain outcome, but it offers this one insight for a wider audience: golf's reputation as the most ""honourable"" sport isn't quite as straightforward as golf likes to think it is."

The fact that it prefers to deport rather than lash homosexuals was provided as evidence of its progress, as was the fact that Qatari women have more rights than women in Saudi Arabia. Quotes proving the country's commitment to education were lifted directly from the website of the Qatar Foundation, an organisation set up by its emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani.
Criticism of Qatar's victory is not just correct, it is highly necessary. Unfortunately, it has been misdirected. While concerns over women's rights and attitudes to homosexuality (not to mention the irresponsible lunacy of air-conditioning the desert) are entirely valid, there has been no meaningful criticism of what is by far the most problematic aspect of Qatar 2022: the systematic exploitation of the country's migrant workforce and the possible enslavement of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of impoverished south Asian migrant workers, who will be imported to meet the demands of a construction sector expected to swell twentyfold from $5bn to $100bn over the next 12 years.
Migrant workers constitute approximately 70% of Qatar's population of 1.4 million and a significant number of these are unskilled and semi-skilled workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The treatment of workers in the construction sector in Qatar is as exploitative as the well-publicised abuse of migrant workers in its glitzy neighbour, the United Arab Emirates.
Workers arrive in the country heavily indebted, having borrowed from moneylenders or mortgaged their land to finance inflated travel and visa costs. Their passports are immediately and customarily confiscated and they are typically forced to sign a revised contract that pays them a significantly lower rate than was originally agreed.
Strikes and trade unions are expressly banned, and the labour and immigration status of migrants is regulated by the kafala system, which ties each worker to one employer in a highly dependent relationship. The results are depressingly familiar: unpaid wages, inhumane living conditions, unsafe working conditions and suicides.
Qatar, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has been referred to as a ""death trap for hundreds of thousands of construction workers"" from some of the poorest countries in the world. Female domestic workers, meanwhile, are not covered by national labour law  an omission which, as Amnesty International rightly pointed out, ""allows employers to exploit, enslave, abuse, assault and injure their domestic workers with virtual impunity"". There is a strong argument for saying that in the worst cases of abuse, the treatment of migrant workers constitutes slavery in international law.
To scholars of slavery, an assertion that the institution is alive and well in Gulf states such as Qatar should come as no surprise. Slavery has always flourished in societies with an overly developed sense of honour such as ancient Rome and Greece, and the southern states of the US. Recent highly publicised cases involving members of the royal families of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provide clear evidence of the attitudes of the regions' ruling elites to servitude.
The massive boom in Qatar's construction sector will bring hundreds of thousands of south Asian migrant workers into a culturally, politically and socially homogenous region in which slavery's moral repugnance has not yet been fully recognised, and a country whose labour market was designed to grant employers absolute control over their workers.
Qatar is far from backward: Doha-based al-Jazeera's boldness in criticising its neighbours is testament to that, even accounting for recent WikiLeaks revelations. But its treatment of its migrant workforce is, in stark contrast to the lavish treatment of its nationals, crude and brutal. Allowing women to drive and not whipping homosexuals does not a progressive state make, and morally relativist defences of the country play into the hands of those who seek to delay reform.
Qatar 2022 represents an opportunity for the country to take the lead on workers' rights in the region. As the International Labour Organisation urged this week, it should abolish the kafala system, introduce a national minimum wage and make provision for the introduction of trade unions. If it does not do so, Qatar 2022 will be constructed on the sort of brutality we naively associate with a bygone era."

bin Khalifa Al-Thani: Ambitious emir's World Cup win,"Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani is a big man, whether wearing a business suit or the flowing robes of a traditional Gulf ruler, and he wore his very broadest smile in Zurich on Thursday when Qatar won its quest for the 2022 World Cup  a crowning achievement for one of the world's smallest, richest and hottest countries.
TV footage of the big moment captured the emir's delight  and his warm hug with his son Sheikh Mohammed, who headed the Qatari bid. On hand too, equally pleased, was his consort Sheikha Mozah, elegant and stylish in purple silk, who embraced her son and husband before mounting the podium with them to accept the golden trophy.
Qatar, it is widely agreed, tackled its two-year campaign to persuade Fifa of its merits with the same flair and determination it has shown in translating its enormous wealth into a unique brand  an Arab statelet in one of the world's most volatile regions but one with global ambitions and a hard-headed sense of political and economic realities.
Football is certainly a genuine passion for Sheikh Hamad  a sporty youngster and a devoted Arsenal fan since his days as a Sandhurst cadet in the 1970s. Now 58, he still also enjoys diving and falconry and is known in private for a joshing and self-deprecating sense of humour.
Money is definitely not a problem. The emir's personal worth is around $2.4bn though since the country has neither political parties nor national elections he also effectively controls its $100bn sovereign wealth fund. But he was still chuffed to be presented with a signed Gunners strip during a state visit to Britain in October  and flattered by being hosted by the Queen at Windsor rather than over the shop at Buckingham Palace.
""If he is relaxing in private the chances are that he will have several TV screens up showing different matches, Qatari and international  even when he is in the desert,"" says a friend. To be the first Arab or Muslim country to host the World Cup is a personal and patriotic dream come true.
Qataris and foreigners alike argue that the key to understanding Sheikh Hamad's focus on the 2022 bid is his vision  the word is used often and without irony  of how to develop the tiny and then nearly bankrupt country he took over from his father in a palace coup in 1995. Sport and youth are key elements. ""Qatar is already extremely rich and it's going to get richer and richer,"" predicts Simon Collis, a former British ambassador to Doha. ""Sheikh Hamad recognises the self-evident pitfall of cradle-to-grave social security and an overall lack of 'oomph' in the system. He knows that whatever motivates Qataris it's not going to be money.""
Ordinary Qatari kids compete in athletics, tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, karate, gymnastics and judo. The Asian Games in 2006 were a sensational success  with real verve and risk-taking in the organisation. Sheikh Mohammed carried the torch on a horse in a sudden rare rain shower that was taken as a sign of good fortune.
The disappointment was real when Doha failed to make even the short list for the 2016 Olympics. So joy at the World Cup win last week was unconfined. ""Everyone is happy to see that we have been recognised,"" said an ecstatic Hassan Al Ansari, editor-in-chief of the Qatar Tribune. ""We are still absorbing the news.""
Absolute rulers do tend to attract praise, at least from those seeking their patronage, or from their subjects not willing to offend. But there seems to be genuine recognition of the emir's lobbying  and above all his leadership. ""He is a motivator, but he also delegates,"" says the Algerian lawyer Sa'ad Jabbar. ""He is a good listener who knows how to use expertise. He knows what he wants. He rolls up his sleeves and keeps pushing.""
The decision to give the tournament to Qatar did, however, provoke plenty of criticism from those concerned about what can most gently be described its ""chequered"" human rights record. This was neatly captured in a report by Amnesty International, detailing issues ranging from routine discrimination against women, the illegality of homosexuality, and sentences of flogging. Amnesty also called on Qatar to ""lift restrictions on the rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to take steps to promote freedom of the press"".
Then there is the less than benign conditions enjoyed by many of its foreign workers. There's a population of around 800,000  the rest of the 1.7 million residents are foreigners, many Asian construction workers.
The country certainly gets things built. The capital's tallest building is the aptly named Aspire Tower in Sports City. Then there is the beautiful Islamic Museum designed by IM Pei. Other eye-catching achievements include the al-Jazeera satellite TV network, still the freest media outlet in the Arab world  even if it does not focus too closely on Qatar's internal affairs.
Surplus revenues from the world's third largest deposits of natural gas have gone a long way. The Qatar Investment Authority has invested in German car maker VW/Porsche and the Brazilian unit of Spanish bank Santander. Trophy acquisitions include Harrods, the US embassy building in Grosvenor Square and other chunks of prime London property.
Admirers see a clear link between Sheikh Hamad's independent position, Qatar's business acumen, and his ability to get his way on other fronts. Politically, he manages to maintain good relations with the US  hosting the US Fifth Fleet  and with Iran. Still, Tehran is unlikely to be surprised by WikiLeaks's cables revealing that he told an American senator in February: ""Based on 30 years of experience with the Iranians, they will give you 100 words. Trust only one of the 100.""
Qatar has also maintained discreet contact with Israel  though more openly than its Gulf neighbours  inviting then foreign minister Tzipi Livni to one of Doha's many international conferences. Qatari mediation has become a staple of the region's many conflicts  in Sudan, Yemen, Lebanon and between rival Palestinian factions. Qatari cash helped re-build south Lebanon after the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war. The emir also offered to pay for reconstruction in Gaza if Israel agreed to lift its siege.
Conservative  and poorer  Arab states bridle at Qatar's role. Jordan and Qatar have been embroiled in a furious row since it was revealed that al-Jazeera  which had a monopoly on last summer's World Cup TV rights  had its broadcasts from South Africa jammed from Jordanian territory. The Saudis and others ban the channel or regularly close down its offices. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak privately called the Qataris ""sycophants""  another WikiLeaks gem.
Football is a far less serious business than politics, but the World Cup carries a big political message too. Qatar's bid was carefully pitched in an attempt to improve the atmosphere and image of change in a region overshadowed for so long by rivalries, injustice and hatred. Prince Mohammed's winning speech in Zurich contained this Obama-style message: ""Thank you for believing in change, for believing in expanding the game, for giving Qatar a chance."" Israel is unlikely to qualify  but Israeli fans will be able to attend.
Securing the World Cup was billed by the communications strategists as a national mission. ""This was truly a bid that involved an entire nation,"" said John Watts, of Brown Lloyd James, consultants for Qatar 2022. ""The royal family, the organisation, the general public. Part of what made the bid so compelling was that you had this sense of unanimous political, financial and moral support. A groundswell really.""
Yet victory was no foregone conclusion. ""It was written off as a joke at the beginning,"" Watts added, ""but they believed in it. They really believed that 700 million people needed the power of the World Cup to bring them together.""
Qataris did wonder whether this was a dream too far. But the country's track record of delivery and its huge cash reserves proved a winning combination. ""True, there's a lot to do, and even the Qataris can't change the climate,"" laughs Collis. But if anyone can solve the problem of playing football in 45-50 degree heat, they can. And the generosity of building and then dismantling staggeringly expensive air-conditioned stadiums to send to developing countries was a novel and powerful legacy argument.
""People do ask sometimes why the emir does certain things  whether it's his diplomacy in the Middle East or having al-Jazeera here,"" admitted Hassan Al Ansari.

If those words still seem a little incongruous two days after Fifa's vote awarded hosting rights for the world's biggest football tournament to a desert state, the origin of the story is stranger still.
Two years ago Qatari leaders were grappling with a fundamental problem. Their nation's hydrocarbon output is set to peak in 2012, creating a pressing need to diversify an economy that will soon be growing at 20% a year. Tourism, as most fast?maturing economies discover, is a good way of going about it but, in a highly competitive market, pushing the Qatari brand would always be a challenge.
Dubai's rise to become the Arabic-speaking tourism destination of choice had turned into a vast vanity project, ultimately consuming the emirate in a gulf of debt. By contrast Qatar's genius was to alight on a cost-effective plan for getting their nation's name out there: joining a competition to host the World Cup, a race that would grab the attention of sections of the world's media throughout. If by some quirk it won, the prize would be immense.
""Although that might have been the case at the start,"" Qatar 2022's campaign strategist, the Englishman Mike Lee, said this year, ""now there's a real feeling we can win this thing.""
Lee would be proved right but few shared his instincts. The candidacy of Qatar's capital, Doha, for the 2016 summer Olympic Games had fallen flat. Success for Doha's bid would have shifted the event to late October, outside the International Olympic Committee's stipulated date range, since only those dates would have avoided the worst of the summer heat and humidity. Temperatures in Qatar can push mercury beyond 50C in June and July.
Yet Fifa, which has previously taken its tournament to Mexico and to US cities where summer temperatures can peak at similar heights, does not share the IOC's concerns. The Olympics' organiser has the health of marathon runners, road cyclists and 50km race-walkers to consider.
Nonetheless, although the game's 24 remote rulers in the executive committee, which made the decision to award the tournament to Qatar on Thursday, are nonchalant about the heat, it is not a view widely shared in football. ""Who knows if the big football nations in Europe will even go to Qatar in 2022,"" one senior football figure told the Guardian. ""I could see some clubs saying they don't want their players to go there because it is too dangerous healthwise.""
That would be a serious problem for the game as a whole, since it is the big European clubs alone who pay the wages of most World Cup players. The son of Qatar's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, whose central and multilingual involvement in the bid campaign proved so persuasive for Fifa, must now persuade the world that the heat is manageable. ""We can guarantee 27 degrees on the pitch,"" he has said. ""A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well.""
The 2022 bid team made much play of the 15,000-seat Al Sadd stadium, with its gas-powered air-cooling system. It intends the second-generation versions, with 70,000 seats, to be solar powered  as is one currently under construction in another Gulf state.
Qatar has the advantage of hosting the Asian Games next year but there have been doubts about the construction schedule for that event. ""With the Asian Games, it became a last-minute panic to get everything ready and in place,"" one Doha resident told Reuters. ""The biggest thing is that there is so much to be done. It's a monumental task and you need to finish it a few years early.""
However, perhaps the biggest challenge for a country with sports-tourism ambitions is whether the supporters will decamp to the desert for the tournament. Fans' appetite for alcohol during a World Cup is voracious. During the 2006 World Cup in Germany more than a million litres of beer were sold in the stadiums alone, with the four-week World Cup finals contributing to a 190.4m-litre increase in Germany's annual beer consumption.
Qatar will have to work hard to counteract the perception that as an Islamic state the World Cup will come into conflict with local alcohol laws: it will not. One advantage of the Thanis' absolutism is that they can alter legislation at a whim.
""These plans show just how serious, innovative and focused we are about hosting a Fifa World Cup that will deliver a fantastic experience for players, fans and the media,"" Thani has said, and Fifa was convinced.
Elsewhere, however, doubts linger. And those who fear Qatar's infrastructure might strain in accommodating the tournament in 12 years had fuel for their suspicions yesterday. At the first sign of genuine global interest, the bid's website server collapsed.
This article was amended on 6 December 2010. The original referred to Qatar's ruler as Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Thani. This has been corrected."

It's all down to Qatar's oil dollars and Fifa's corruption, according to some of the comments posted in a Guardian discussion thread.
Worse still for soccer fans, drinking alcohol in Qatar is supposedly a crime, and any gay fans will be beaten up and flogged. That's before we come to readers' phobias about Islam and the terrorism threat: according to one commenter, ""the Taliban probably can't believe their luck"".
Most of this is nonsense, but let's start with a bit of background. Qatar is actually quite a nice place to visit: it's clean with lots of modern buildings, including a faked-ancient souk. It's also rather boring. Don't go and live there unless you happen to be a workaholic and/or a golfaholic.
Qatar is ludicrously wealthy. Apart from substantial amounts of oil, it's the world's largest supplier of liquefied natural gas and has the world's third-largest natural gas reserves  all for a population of only 1.5 million.
Since money is no problem, one thing we can be reasonably sure of is that when 2022 arrives, Qatar's World Cup infrastructure will meet the highest standards and there won't be a last-minute cliffhanger over facilities as happened with the Commonwealth Games in India.
Among the nouveaux riches Gulf states, Qatar has used its wealth more wisely than most. Not by constructing ski slopes in the desert or man-made islands in fancy shapes (a la Dubai), but by investing in its people. Any Qatari citizen who wishes to study abroad can do so at the state's expense and Education City, established by the Qatar Foundation on the outskirts of Doha, is an impressive place. With tie-ups to various American universities, it aims to provide world-class teaching and ""bring knowledge to the people of Qatar and the region"".
This is not to suggest there aren't things wrong with Qatar. It isn't a democracy and it doesn't allow political parties. Women have more rights and opportunities than in Saudi Arabia but the society as a whole is still deeply conservative. If you're going to fall foul of the authorities, though, there are far worse places. It's now nine years since anyone was executed in Qatar.
Since seizing power from his father in a bloodless coup in 1995, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani (the current ruler) has made strenuous efforts to put his tiny country on the map  most notably by founding al-Jazeera, the Middle East's most-watched TV network. He also turned Qatar into an international conference centre  often by paying the expenses of the people attending them.
Qatar also punches above its weight in international diplomacy. It hosted Centcom during the US-led invasion of Iraq and had diplomatic relations with Israel (thinly disguised as a ""trade mission"") until they were suspended in 2008 over the Gaza war. Meanwhile, it has few qualms about talking to Hezbollah and Hamas, and it is currently mediating in Yemen between the government and the Houthi rebels.
Whether it was through diplomacy or bribery that Qatar got to host the World Cup, I have no idea. But it's worth pointing out that Qatar is regarded as the least corrupt Arab state and in Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index it was ranked 19th worldwide  one place ahead of the UK and four places ahead of the US.
Alcohol is not actually illegal in Qatar, though it's an offence to drink or be drunk in public. The bigger hotels sell alcohol and foreigners living in Qatar can buy it under a permit system. I'm baffled as to why some people think this should disqualify Qatar from hosting the World Cup. Considering the problems that can arise with drunken fans, Qatar's restrictions don't seem unreasonable.
Gay sex is illegal in Qatar, though the authorities don't normally go out of their way to track gay people down. The speculation about gay soccer fans being flogged seems to be based on a case in 1995 when a US citizen received 90 lashes for homosexual activity. The authorities had offered to expel him so as to avoid a trial, but he decided to stay.
Apart from that, and the deportation of 36 allegedly gay Filipinos working in fashion and hairdressing in 1997, very few gay-related cases have been reported in Qatar. Expulsion rather than punishment seems to be the authorities' preferred option when foreigners get into trouble.
That said, I once found a copy of Annie Proulx's story, Brokeback Mountain, on sale at a bookstall in Doha airport and teachers at a college in Education City told me (on the basis of checking browser history in the internet area) that gay websites were among their students' favourites. The odd thing there was that it was a women-only college, and it seemed the female students had discovered gay websites were the best place to look for pictures of naked or scantily-clad men.
Finally, I think it will be some time  longer, even, than 2022  before the Taliban hordes arrive in Qatar. Compared with some parts of the Middle East, the country has had very little trouble with jihadist militants.
But Qatar does have a few worrying religious connections, apart from Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the controversial Islamic scholar who is based there. Under the guise of inter-faith dialogue and promoting ""family values"" it has occasionally made common cause with Mormons and the more extreme elements in the Roman Catholic church."

As terms such as photovoltaic, solar fractions and low-e layers suffused the balmy Middle Eastern air, memories of remorseless boredom relieved only by an unfortunate incident with a Bunsen burner flooded back.
Fortunately this latest lecture swiftly proved much more fun. Delivered inside a miniature football ground, it detailed how Qatar will harness carbon neutral solar energy to air-conditioned stadiums if it wins the race to host the 2022 World Cup.
The technological wizardry is already virtually foolproof but, to a scientific dunce, the really exciting thing about such innovation is its potential geopolitical and historical impact.
If the 40C June heat no longer presents an insurmountable barrier, a key excuse for failing to award the Middle East a World Cup is removed. And, as everyone I spoke to said: ""Qatar winning this would be about far more than just football.""
An unprecedented opportunity awaits to forge fresh, enhanced understanding with the Arab world. This chance to deconstruct some tired preconceptions about Muslim mindsets should not be shunned lightly. With a successful tournament serving as a highly effective slap in the face of extremism, Islamic fundamentalists could even be in for some overdue marginalisation.Admittedly passports bearing Israeli stamps do not exactly go down a storm in the Gulf but Qataris are adamant that, were Israel to qualify, they and their supporters would receive warm welcomes.
It is surely not impossible that greater regional rapprochement could be achieved through impromptu political talking shops convened alongside the football fields of Doha than during countless conventional conferences in Washington, Jerusalem or Sharm el-Sheikh.
Not that the game's international showpiece would be a sideshow. Whether wearing sparkling white dishdashas, the hijab or the latest, tightest, western fashions, the Qataris who packed the Khalifa Stadium to 50,000 capacity for last Wednesday's Brazil v Argentina friendly certainly thrilled to Lionel Messi's brilliant late winner.
If their enthusiasm served as a reminder that no Arab country has staged a World Cup, the number of Anglo-Saxon footballers who take regular June holidays in Dubai suggests Qatar's scorching summer heat is far from a deal breaker. Particularly as not only stadiums but training grounds and fan facilities would be air-conditioned and the security and convenience peerless.
Liberated from the hassle of constantly changing hotel rooms and draining cross country travel, those attending a largely Doha-centric tournament featuring all 12 stadiums within close proximity could attend three matches a day.
In-between games, fabulous beach-front hotels, ancient souks, modern shopping malls and the capital's excellent Museum of Islamic Arts should provide high calibre relaxation. Slightly more adventurous types might visit the Al Maha sanctuary, home of the rare Arabian oryx, before camping among desert dunes.
With crime nearly nonexistent, Qatar is also very safe, which mattered to a lone woman traversing Doha during the early hours following an overnight flight last week that mattered. Many football fans appreciate similar reassurance.
Most northern European supporters also seek alcohol. Although alcohol is rarely available outside hotels  addressing a partly indigenous audience in the Gulf last week Sir Alex Ferguson received distinctly puzzled looks when he blithely reflected: ""You'll have all played for Sunday pub teams""  restrictions on its consumption would, crucially, be lifted inside all-singing, all-dancing, FanZones.
If Manchester United's manager should have known that Friday is the Islamic Sunday, at least Ferguson grasped the bigger picture. Describing Qatar 2022's potential legacy as ""a winner"" he predicted the World Cup magic would endure long after the last empties had been recycled and the final departing fan had carried their toy camel safely through customs.
Thanks to an inspired piece of Qatari altruism, an entire air-conditioned stadium would be dismantled and exported to a poor, hot country, for reconstruction, with further chunks of other grounds, most notably seats, distributed to other needy developing nations. At a moment when several of this country's leading commentators are seriously suggesting that the late, eye-catching, introduction of a fresh pair of legs  belonging to brand new royal fiancee Kate Middleton  could somehow revitalise England's 2018 bid such long term strategic thinking looks enviably innovative.
With Fifa obsessive about legacy Ferguson believes it is also eminently capable of sparking pan-Arab celebrations on 2 December when the 2018 and 2022 venues are revealed.
""Qatar have got the finances and the purpose,"" he said. ""But, above all, they've got the vision.""
A little earlier the Scot had explained how his initially eyebrow-raising importation of Eric Cantona's on-field prescience sparked the modern day Old Trafford glory era while also securing personal immortality in United's managerial pantheon.
Mustering the bravery to hand Qatar 2022 might yet enable Fifa to gift the world a Cantona moment."

Only a few years ago the first part of that conversation might have seemed entirely incongruous but this tiny desert peninsula is now home to a modern, wealthy, efficient and, above all, geopolitically ambitious nation. Suddenly the game's leading lights are starting to take Qatar extremely seriously. Scores of football's most famous faces have convened in the Arabian Gulf this week. They are here not only for Argentina's friendly with Brazil at the Khalifa Stadium tomorrow night but to endorse Qatar's increasingly convincing endeavours to bring football's international showpiece to the Middle East.
Carlos Alberto is rubbing shoulders with the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson, Ossie Ardiles and Niall Quinn but, more than 40 years on from his ""moment"", the 1970 World Cup winner  and scorer of one of the most iconic goals in the tournament's history  he turns more heads than most as he spreads the message that Doha is an ideal place to play and watch football. ""Qatar have all the right conditions to host a World Cup,"" Carlos Alberto says. ""They have a good airport, good roads, good stadiums, good hotels and good weather. I like this region, 10 years ago I was national coach to Oman, which is also a very nice place, so I know a bit about the area.""
A decade ago the idea of a World Cup played in a Qatari June in temperatures in excess of 40C (104F) would have been laughable but the country's carbon?neutral, fully air?conditioned stadiums and training arenas are proving criticism confounding. The country's geopolitical strategic standing as both a hub offering easy links to east and west and a proudly Muslim country in which numerous nationalities and religions happily coexist suggests that the latest cooling technologies and a close to nonexistent crime rate are far from the only reasons why it should win the 2022 vote in Zurich on 2 December.
As locals celebrated the Muslim feast of Eid al Adha, the bid's organisers explained that the fan?friendly proximity of the Doha?centric stadia would turn their mooted tournament into a true football festival. Unlike most venues it is an ""all in one destination"" liberating visiting supporters from costly and tiring internal travel.
Neymar, expected to start alongside Ronaldinho here against Lionel Messi et al, will still be only 30 in 2022. Carlos Alberto believes the Santos forward, whom Chelsea are monitoring, should have, by then, long since established himself as the globe's foremost player. ""Neymar is the best Brazilian player in the last five years,"" he says. ""He's already ready to be a big star in Europe. ""Sometimes he can be a bit crazy but Neymar can be the best in the world, in two or three years time he can be there.""
While Ferguson and Quinn will surely cast interested eyes in the 18-year-old's direction tomorrow night, South American interest may be focused on the dug-outs where both Brazil and Argentina have changed coaches since the World Cup. While, in the latter's case, Sergio Batista has replaced Diego Maradona, Mano Menezes occupies Dunga's old shoes. Football's international guard is changing and, like Batista and Menezes, Qatar aims to be a big part of the game's new world order.
Carlos Alberto was speaking at the 2010 Aspire4Sport Conference and Expo in Doha"
