hoping to cash-in on World Cup fever, but when it comes to taking host Qatar to task over its human rights record protest marketing has taken a back seat to sales targets.
In the run-up to kick off of the football tournament in Qatar criticism of the gulf state was akin to shooting at an open goal.
The singer Robbie Williams took flak for performing at the opening ceremony while former England captain David Beckham, who has historically supported gay fans and players, faced a brand backlash over a £150m deal to be an ambassador for Qatar 2022.
Among the teams participating, Australia struck first, posting a video featuring 16 players raising concerns over the treatment of migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people. England and Wales made much of a plan to defy footballs world governing body Fifa by wearing the rainbow OneLove armband, a symbol of equality and LGBTQ+ rights, before backing down just before their first match after warnings players could be yellow carded for doing so.
The stage was set for UK brands to use the marketing amplification provided by the worlds biggest sporting event to weigh in and affirm their ethical credentials. But it didnt happen. Ad agencies estimate between £85m and £100m will be spent on advertising around the World Cup across all UK media during the tournament, but, like the England players, brands have shied away from confrontation with Qatar.
Their silence is all the more surprising given many World Cup sponsors are usually only too keen to show their support for gay rights. Coca-Cola was an official sponsor of London and Brighton Pride 2022, Adidas has launched a range of Pride-themed products, McDonalds and Budweiser have branded buns and beer bottles, while Hyundai released an ad earlier this year boasting the carmakers support for the LGBTQ+ community not just during Pride month, but 365 days a year.
At this years Cannes Lions, the worlds biggest and most prestigious advertising awards, a record 27 of the 31 top prizes went to campaigns that had a social cause or injustice at its heart.
The hypocrisy is ridiculous, says one ad industry executive. Whether it be organic farming, saving the oceans, womens or gay rights, mental health, knife crime etc these sorts of campaigns are everywhere. Many of the brands advertising during the World Cup are super-progressive, they have strong environmental, social and governance policies  but none of it applies when it comes to associating with, or highlighting, Qatar.
Advertising experts had certainly expected an anti-Qatar marketing drive. There were precedents  during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, some brands did make a stand. Paddy Power, for example, donated £10,000 to an LGBT-focused charity for every goal scored by Russia.
While a survey carried out by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising found that half of consumers would respect brands more for addressing issues around the World Cup being hosted in Qatar, we have seen surprisingly few brands take the opportunity to do so, said Nick Breen, a partner at the law firm Reed Smith. Brands want to avoid perpetuating an anti-World Cup association no matter how honourable the intentions may be. It can be difficult for brands to walk the line between standing up for their values publicly and being perceived as being the morality police by their audience.
On the field, as the goals and excitement have mounted, with the tournament offering the hope of England making a semi-final, Qatar has transitioned from being embroiled in a human rights storm to destination football, leaving advertisers to focus on selling beer, soft drinks, clothing, cars and financial services.
The reality is that fans and brands alike will acquiesce, because they always do, says James Kirkham. There is a certain suspended state and the world comes together. Ad agencies would struggle to fight this sentiment. To recommend a contrary purpose-driven approach to their clients is beyond bold because it is swimming against such a tide. The strength of the swell of opinion would immediately risk ridicule or at least mean you get lost in the noisy euphoria.
The only major brand to break ranks has been BrewDog, which launched an anti-sponsor campaign questioning whether Qatar passes muster then North Korea could be considered as a World Cup host, prompting immediate criticism and ridicule given well-publicised allegations of poor treatment of brewers own staff.
A total of 64 games will be played to decide the winner of this years World Cup, making television the biggest medium for reaching huge audiences. Fifa estimates the tournament will attract more than 5 billion viewers globally, up from 3.57 billion for Russia 2018.
Brands are free to piggy back on the event with alternative messages to the official sponsors.

Nike and Pepsi are both running global campaigns, the usual quadrennial gatecrash of advertising designed to undermine official sponsors Adidas and Coca-Cola. But their ads, feature global stars Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé, have steered away from any overtly ethical messaging.
A spokesperson for ITV, which is jointly broadcasting the World Cup with the ad-free BBC, says that it would run TV ads critical of Qatar as long as they pass muster with the clearance body Clearcast and the UK watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority.
Under the Communications Act 2003 policed by the regulator Ofcom, political advertising is banned from broadcast media, such as TV and radio, although it is allowed on nonbroadcast sites, which is why Brewdogs posters were allowed to stay up.
And UK broadcasters are free to promote upcoming shows in advertising slots, as it is deemed to be editorial content rather than commercial space.
In 2014, Channel 4, which held the TV broadcast rights to the Winter Paralympics in Sochi rebranded its on-screen logo with rainbow colours and launched a TV ad campaign called Gay Mountain in protest at Russias anti-gay laws.
Channel 4s remit is to challenge, represent and champion minorities, says David Abraham, its chief executive at the time. It felt as an organisation that it was the right thing for us to do independently.
However, such a bite the hand that feeds you tactic is not one that management at ITV is likely to have entertained when it developed its own World Cup promotion, with its rights relationship with Fifa likely to be worth as much as £70m in advertising across the tournament, according to a media agency estimate. But Fifa is a different organisation to the International Paralympic Committee.
The Paralympic committee and organisation were supportive, says Abraham. They were promoting a progressive agenda towards minorities and had an agenda around expanding accessibility and changing attitudes in society generally. It was an editorial decision we took with the full support of our board."

Griezmann has been vocal in his support for LGBTQ+ people and said he was proud when the A-League player Josh Cavallo became the first active openly gay male footballer in the world last year. In May, the Blackpool teenager Jake Daniels became the first male footballer in the UK to come out as gay since 1990.
In 2019 the Atlético Madrid forward was the cover star of Têtu, a gay magazine, telling the French publication: Homophobia isnt an idea, its a crime. At the time he added: If a gay footballer wants to come out, he may not have all the players on his side, but he will have me! It is up to us, parents, to educate our children so that they grow up in a less homophobic and less sexist world.
Griezmann previously said he sympathised with players who do not come out of the closet because they are afraid. On Friday Griezmann was asked whether he was embarrassed playing in Qatar after being outspoken on LGBTQ+ rights. Embarrassed? Yes and no, he replied. It doesnt matter where I am, that community will always have my support. Im a footballer, thats my job. Im paid for playing football and I do it with pride. All my respect is there for [the LGBTQ+ community].
Griezmann had earlier joked that Kylian Mbappé was irreproachable after his glittering start to the tournament and insisted the 23-year-old has immersed himself into the France squad since they were crowned world champions in Russia four years ago. Mbappé is a contender for the Golden Boot after scoring three of Frances six goals before they face Poland on Sunday, hoping to advance to the quarter-finals and avoid a repeat of their last-16 exit at Euro 2020.

Kylian is not the same player or the same personality right now, Griezmann said when asked about the differences between Mbappé at this World Cup and the last. On top of that we see him a lot more in the group, in the training hes a lot more present, he talks a lot, he is very important for us. Every gesture that he does on or off pitch is going to be closely watched by the journalists, by the fans, and by his teammates too. He is irreproachable, he added, smiling.

Griezmann said France need to guard against complacency after coming unstuck against Switzerland on penalties last year. I think maybe we were a bit too relaxed against Switzerland, he said. We were leading 3-1 and we thought we had won. But in big competitions like that it is difficult, there is no easy opponent. Against Poland it is going to be the same. It is going to be complicated. We have to prepare well and nothing is guaranteed. I think were on the right path now."

The man, who waved a rainbow flag and wore a shirt saying Save Ukraine on one side and Respect for Iranian woman [sic] on the other, has also had his Hayya card taken from him. The card doubles as a permit for international fans to enter Qatar and allows them to attend games and travel for free on the metro.
A Supreme Committee spokesperson told the Guardian: Following the pitch invasion that took place during last nights Portugal v Uruguay match, we can confirm that the individual involved was released shortly after being removed from the pitch. His embassy has been informed.

As a consequence of his actions, and as is standard practice, his Hayya card has been cancelled and he has been banned from attending future matches at this tournament. Security staff quickly intervened and moved away the protester, who was supported afterwards by Portugals Rúben Neves.
We know what has happened around this World Cup, said Neves. Its a normal thing to happen. Of course, we are all with them as well. Iran as well, because I saw his shirt. I hope nothing happens to the boy because we understand his message and I think all the world understood it as well.
The tournament has been surrounded by controversy that started with Qatars treatment of migrant workers and its LGBTQ+ community. Since the World Cup began issues have also included Wales fans having rainbow hats confiscated or removed by security guards and some Iran supporters being told not to wear T-shirts backing anti-government protests in their country. The head of the organising committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, described the rainbow flag as divisive in an interview on Monday."

Wales were among the nations to U-turn on wearing the rainbow-coloured OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights after Fifa threatened sporting sanctions.
Fifa and the Qatari authorities have been in dialogue after the FAW sought urgent clarity over the circumstances that led to supporters being ordered to remove rainbow-coloured clothing if they were to enter the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.

That is not what I have seen, I have to say. To have our fans having their bucket hats taken off them is just appalling. Their voice was taken away, the players voices were taken away by the armband. For that we are deeply disappointed.
Before receiving assurances from Fifa on Thursday, Wales made a point of reiterating their inclusive message to fans by displaying rainbow-coloured flags at their Al Sadd Sports Club training base. A large rainbow flag is draped from a pitch-side tent and corner flags decorated with the Welsh dragon were changed in support of the LGBTQ+ community.

He referred to the host nation Qatar as a desert country with an oppressive regime and a terrible human rights record where homosexuality is illegal, in other words its like if Ron Desantis had oil.
To protest this, seven countries saw their captains trying to wear rainbow armbands that said one love. In response, Fifa said it would give a yellow card to anyone doing this as well as ordering Belgium to remove the word love from their shirts.
Theyre banning love and rainbows, Colbert said. Basically Fifa is the bad guy in a Care Bears movie.
This week also saw the Iranian team stay silent during the national anthem to protest the countrys violent and misogynist regime. Colbert said it was incredibly brave or they forgot the words.
After years of attempts, we may finally get to see Donald Trumps taxes after the supreme court voted against another attempt to suppress them, a case that has been going on since 2019, a year when N95 was just a bingo number and Pete Davidson was dating Kate Beckinsale.
This Thanksgiving has been renamed danksgiving by some as so many states have now legalised weed but Colbert warned that it could be a gateway to harder holidays like Crackmas, Rosh Hashanah and St Patricks Day.
The first licences for recreational marijuana have also finally been produced in New York. New Yorkers are gonna be so excited to finally try marijuana, Colbert joked.
On Late Night, Seth Meyers spoke about Joe Bidens annual turkey pardoning quoting a joke he made: The only red wave this season would be if his dog knocked over the cranberry sauce.
He responded with a groan: Too bad his dog didnt have the presence of mind to knock over the microphone.
Meyers also added that it would be the slowest wave ever before revealing the true meaning of Thanksgiving: Getting high with your weird cousins when things get too tense inside.
Biden has said that he will make a decision about running for 2024 in the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Whatever you think of him, its impressive that an 80-year-old man is planning that far ahead, he said. If I was 80 I dont think Id plan on bingeing a show that had more than one season.
Maxwell Frost, the first Gen Z member of Congress, has said that he believes that Biden does adequately represent the values of his generation. Meyers agreed as he also knows what its like to live in a house youll never own.
On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host also spoke about Trumps taxes. We may actually finally maybe get to see what Darth Tax Evader has been hiding from us, he joked.
He said that Trump was very upset and played a montage of the times he has promised to release his taxes which is more times than he promised to release Melania.
This week also saw a report that Trumps team is requesting that the FBI return personal items that were seized from Mar-a-Lago, including golf shirts and multiple pictures of Celine Dion. Is it possible hes even weirder than we thought he was? Kimmel asked
Trump is also reportedly pissed that Republicans dont want him to help the controversial Georgian candidate Herschel Walker as he prepares for a runoff as it could hurt his chances.
Herschel Walker doesnt need Donald Trump out there to make him look bad, hes doing a very good job of that himself, he joked.
This week also saw the annual arrival of the Christmas tree to the White House, a presidential tradition since Joe Biden was a teenager in 1889."

Those confronted included the former Wales footballer Prof Laura McAllister, a trustee of the FAW Trust and a past Fifa council candidate, who said it was a small moral victory that she managed to eventually get the hat into the stadium.
I pointed out that Fifa had made lots of comments about supporting LGBT rights in this tournament and said to them that coming from a nation where were very passionate about equality for all people, I wasnt going to take my hat off, said McAllister, a professor of public policy at Cardiff University. They were insistent that unless I took the hat off we werent actually allowed to come into the stadium.
Others had to surrender their hats. The Rainbow Wall, a Welsh LGBTQ+ fans group, said on Twitter: Not the men, just women. @FIFAcom ARE YOU SERIOUS!!
Earlier the US journalist Grant Wahl said he was detained by security staff after he wore a rainbow shirt to the match. One security guard told him they were protecting him from fans inside who might have attacked him for wearing it.
It was also reported that a US supporter was threatened on the metro travelling to the stadium for carrying a small rainbow flag  with the aggressor threatening to kill the man because that flag is banned in this country.

Last week Gerdine Lindhout, Fifas head of experiential marketing and promotion, had promised that LGBTQ+ fans would be safe. Asked what her message would be to those wanting to bring rainbow flags into the fan festival, she smiled. Go for it, she said. This event is all about celebration.
Meanwhile, problems with Fifas ticketing app, which led to hundreds of England fans missing the start of their 6-2 victory over Iran, are yet to be fixed.
Some fans queued for paper tickets at a convention centre in Doha after realising that, having logged out of their app in the previous 24 hours, they could no longer gain access. It is understood these issues were still being worked on on Tuesday."

Captains from seven European teams intended to wear the OneLove rainbow armband at the tournament in Qatar, but ditched the plan before the first round of group matches amid fears they would receive an immediate booking for the show of solidarity.
The England captain, Harry Kane, said the decision had been taken out of his hands and was instead forced to wear Fifas anti-discrimination armband in his teams opening win over Iran.
In a scathing social media post addressing Fifa, Cavallo said the lack of support for the inclusivity push meant he had lost all respect for the games world governing body.
I love my identity, the Adelaide United player wrote. Seeing you have banned all teams to wear the One Love armband to actively support LGBTQ+ at the World Cup. You have lost my respect.
All the work my fellow allies and the LGBTQ+ community are doing to make football inclusive, you have shown that football isnt a place for everyone.
Kane would have been joined by the Netherlands captain, Virgil van Dijk, and the Wales skipper, Gareth Bale, in wearing the OneLove armbands on Monday, with Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Denmark expected to follow suit in their openers.
But in a joint statement following Fifas edict  which was described by the German federation president, Bernd Neuendorf, as an outrageous demonstration of power from Fifa  the seven national federations confirmed they would not wear the rainbow armbands.
As national federations we cant put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions, including bookings, the statement said.
The Australian captain, Mat Ryan, who appeared in a video with Socceroos teammates before the tournament to raise concerns over human rights issues including the treatment of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, said he had been told if he wore a rainbow armband, he would receive a yellow card.
Ryan said the joint statement released with his teammates a month ago had been an attempt to try to influence positive change in the world.
Asked about Fifas latest directions on armbands, Ryan said: I have got no comment. We made our statement with our players union. Thats all we can control.
Cavallo became the only known male top-flight professional footballer in the world to come out as gay in October last year, prompting an outpouring of support from across the globe. He has since been outspoken on gay rights issues and advocated for inclusivity in football.
Its not the first time weve heard stick to football, he wrote. The attacks on the LGBTQ+ community from World Cup leaders affects so many who live in silence because of your draconian ways. To be a great leader in sport, one must never give up trying to bring all people together."

McAllister, a past Fifa council candidate, said it was a small moral victory that she managed to eventually get the hat into the stadium after being informed that unless she took the hat off, she would not be allowed in.
I pointed out that Fifa had made lots of comments about supporting LGBT rights in this tournament and said to them that coming from a nation where were very passionate about equality for all people, I wasnt going to take my hat off, she said. I think weve had plenty of warning that this wasnt going to be a tournament where human rights, LGBT rights and womens rights were going to be well respected, but coming from a nation like Wales, we were very keen that we still took a stand coming here.
They were insistent that unless I took the hat off we werent actually allowed to come into the stadium.
The Wales manager, Rob Page, said he was not aware fans were ordered to remove their hats. Its a shame they werent allowed to bring them in, he said.

Wahl, who works for CBS Sports and writes a popular Substack column, wore the shirt as a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community to the game at Qatars Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar.
However, he said a security guard told him the shirt was not allowed. Wahl said his phone was forcibly ripped from his hands by a guard as he tweeted about the incident. He said he was then detained for 25 minutes and told to remove his shirt, which a member of security staff said was political. He was also asked if he was from the UK.
Im OK, but that was an unnecessary ordeal. Am in the media center, still wearing my shirt. Was detained for nearly half an hour. Go gays ?? https://t.co/S3INBoCz89
Wahl says he told a New York Times journalist who was passing by what had happened and he was detained too before being let go shortly afterwards.
Then a security commander approached me, Wahl wrote in his Substack column. He said they were letting me through and apologized. We shook hands. One of the security guards told me they were just trying to protect me from fans inside who could harm me for wearing the shirt  A Fifa rep later apologized to me as well.
But the entire episode left me wondering: Whats it like for ordinary Qataris who might wear a rainbow shirt when the world isnt watching here? Whats that like?
Wahl said he was subsequently allowed to wear the shirt in the stadium.
A Wales LGBTQ+ supporters group said some of its members were forbidden from wearing rainbow hats at the same game.

Fifa has said everyone is welcome at this years World Cup but LGBTQ+ rights activists and campaigners had earlier on Monday criticized soccers world governing body after it threatened to impose sanctions on players who wear OneLove armbands at the tournament.
England, Wales and five other European nations have confirmed their players will not wear the armband, saying Fifa had made it clear their captains could be booked or forced to leave the pitch if they did so.
Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, said on Twitter: By threatening sporting sanctions & stopping players from wearing #OneLove armbands, Fifa are brushing criticism of human rights abuses under the carpet.
LGBTQ+ people are criminalised in Qatar just for being themselves. No country which abuses the human rights of its people in this way should have been awarded with the honour of hosting a major sporting tournament in the first place.

Countries, teams and players are happy to defend LGBTQ+ people until they themselves are at risk. LGBTQ+ Qataris face a bigger punishment than just a yellow card. The gestures and the activism ended quite easily at the thought of reprimand.
It added: This World Cup is not for all, it has never been for all, and until it ends will not be for all.
The group noted the murders of five people at a gay bar in Colorado Springs over the weekend, adding: Now was the perfect opportunity for people with a massive platform  that of the World Cup  to stand in solidarity with the community. But its fallen apart. Actions speak louder than words, and these actions suggest the risk of a yellow card is more important than the rights of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar.
Peter Tatchell, the director of the human rights organisation Peter Tatchell Foundation, said: The OneLove armband was the tiniest of gestures. It did not even specifically mention LGBTQ+ people. It was a weak campaign but even that was too much for Fifa, who have bullied the England team to not wear it.
Two days ago Fifas president spoke of inclusivity but this ruling shows his true colours. I urge the team captains at their post-match press conferences to spend just 30 seconds to speak out for the rights of women, LGBTs and migrant workers. That would have a huge impact, reaching a global audience of hundreds of millions of people.
A joint statement from 3 Lions Pride and The Rainbow Wall, LGBTQ+ supporters groups for their respective nations, England and Wales, said: All of us at 3 Lions Pride and The Rainbow Wall stand together in condemning the actions of Fifa today.
In seeking to censor European FAs and players by forcing them to abandon using the OneLove armband aimed at tackling all forms of discrimination, Fifa are guilty of crushing the basic human rights to freedom of speech and of expression that every single one of us should have without question.
In doing so, Fifa are also guilty of silencing anti-discrimination work within the game and of giving a platform to hatred. This abuse of power by those who have chosen to remain silent for so long is a gross betrayal of trust and cannot be allowed to stand. We have no faith in Fifa, no trust in this World Cup, there is #NoPrideWithoutAll #WeBelong.
Meanwhile, the comedian Joe Lycett has revealed that the £10,000 cash he appeared to shred as part of a protest against the treatment of LGBTQ+ peoples in Qatar was in fact not destroyed.
Lycett threatened to destroy the money unless the former England player David Beckham cut ties with Qatar and the World Cup, due to the countrys laws banning homosexuality.
Beckham failed to respond, so Lycett appeared to follow through with the act. But on Monday he revealed while the cash going into the shredder was real, it was not destroyed and he had in fact donated the sum to LGBTQ+ charities in advance.
I would never destroy real money, I would never be so irresponsible, Lycett said on Twitter. It was an empty threat to get people talking. In many ways it was like your deal with Qatar, David. Total bullshit from the start."

Lycett had set the former England footballer a deadline of midday on Sunday to withdraw from his role at the tournament. If Beckham pulled out as a Qatar World Cup ambassador before the start of the event, Lycett was offering to donate £10,000 of his own money to gay charities. If Beckham did not, the plan was to shred it, along with what Lycett called the former England captains status as gay icon.
The eye-catching stunt highlighted concerns about the World Cup being hosted in a country where homosexuality can be punished by up to seven years in prison.
Beckham, who in 2002 posed for the cover of the gay magazine Attitude, saying he was honoured to have the tag of gay icon, has faced mounting criticism over his association with the Qatar tournament. The value of the deal is disputed but some say he was offered £150m by the Gulf state.
Lycett tweeted a video of the stunt just after midday, with the words A platform for progress, a Beckham quote about the Qatar tournament. Dressed in rainbow feathers, he put what appeared to be two bundles of cash into a shredder before curtseying to the camera.
A platform for progress pic.twitter.com/EeMelv01nu
Lycett first posted a video on 13 November asking the footballer to reconsider his deal with the Arab country. If you end your relationship with Qatar, I will donate ten grand of my own money (thats a grand for every million youre reportedly getting) to charities that support queer people in football, he said.
However, if you do not I will throw the money into a shredder at midday next Sunday, just before the opening ceremony of the World Cup and stream it right here. Not just the money, but also your status as gay icon will be shredded.
Beckham has not yet publicly acknowledged or responded to the comedian.

The stunt divided people online. Many showed support for Lycett under the hashtag #BendersLikeBeckham, but others were uncomfortable with destroying money during a cost of living crisis. Some questioned whether the money was real.
The former culture secretary Nadine Dorries had urged the comedian to rethink before the stunt went ahead, tweeting: Shredding 10k will earn Joe Lycett far more than it will cost him and is in effect a paid-for publicity stunt which has worked.
Job done. No one will think any worse of him now if he changes his mind at the last minute and donates it to a homeless shelter in time for Christmas."

The singer, 48, has been criticised on social media for agreeing to sing during the tournament, which begins on Sunday night, due to the countrys human rights record, stance on homosexuality and treatment of migrant workers.
Other musicians including Dua Lipa and Rod Stewart have recently stated that they will not perform there.
But in an excerpt from Williamss interview with Italian newspaper Il Venerdì di Repubblica, scheduled to be published next month, the former Take That member said: Of course, I dont condone any abuses of human rights anywhere.
But, that being said, if were not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldnt even be able to perform in my own kitchen.
He added: Anybody leaving messages saying no to Qatar are doing so on Chinese technology. It would be hypocritical of me to not go [to Qatar] because of the places that I do go to.
Williams is scheduled to perform at Doha Golf Club in Qatar on 8 December.
He said: You get this microscope that goes OK, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them. I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world.
Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere.
The singer added: What were saying is: You behave like us, or we will annex you from society. Behave like us, because weve got it right.
Amnesty International has called on Williams to use his concert to publicly address the accusations against Qatar.
Last weekend, Rod Stewart said he refused a substantial offer to perform in the country. He told the Sunday Times: I was actually offered a lot of money, over $1m, to play there [Qatar] 15 months ago. I turned it down. Its not right to go.
Last week, Dua Lipa denied reports that she will perform at the opening ceremony of the World Cup. The singer wrote on social media that she will look forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made when it became the tournaments host."

and criticise them,"I asked myself the question and my answer was that they cant kill my passion: I still love football, Thomas Hitzlsperger says, but he knows they have tried. It is nine years since he became the first Premier League footballer to reveal he is gay, a decision that improved his life and those of others too. Even today, he says, someone came up to me and said: Are you who I think you are? I said: Probably. He put his thumbs up, said: Good on you.
And thats so powerful, which is why I say to others: its not just your personal situation, which is of course the most important thing. And thats why I dont stop speaking up. Now when I reflect, my decision was all about what impact I can have on society, without overdoing it.
Youd be surprised how many people you can reach, the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder says, reflecting on the role of LGBTQ supporters groups, the increase in symbolism, a shift in attitudes at clubs embracing the gay community. He discusses how more athletes have stood up, how he would love to see a big, active player come out, and how there has been a big, big change. He says: The environment is constantly improving in football, at least in most parts.
And then on Sunday, the World Cup kicks off in a country where being gay is illegal. Only last week Khalid Salman, an ambassador for the competition, described homosexuality as a mental defect. Football enabled this, politicians and sports people have justified or normalised it. David Beckham has been paid to promote Qatar.
Its just wrong, Hitzlsperger says, and nor is the sickening situation for homosexuals in Qatar the only aspect that concerns him. Indeed his discussion now, and the focus of a documentary he has just filmed in Qatar and Nepal, begins instead with the widow describing her husband coming home in a coffin, the workers he met who go unpaid. Those are the stories that have left him wondering where the line is. Not just their line  that, he thinks, is all too clear  but his own.
The former player  who represented Germany 52 times, played in a World Cup and a European Championship and won the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart  has grappled with how he should engage with a tournament he will be watching from a studio in Mainz for German television.
Even doing that meant examining his conscience; while others, such as Gary Neville with beIN Sports, have chosen to go to the Gulf state, Hitzlsperger says: If I had the option, I wouldnt: it just doesnt feel right after what I have seen, the things I have said in public. You cant be paid by Qatar or Fifa and at the same time criticise them, it doesnt make sense.
You see the world we live in: how sick it is that we allowed Qatar to buy the right to send pictures to the world for four weeks, presenting themselves as something theyre not. Its not just sad, its sick.
A Nepali worker told me he saw people collapse in the heat, so theyre put in a room to cool down for an hour, then you have to work again. The paperwork says: Died in his sleep. Thats not the reason. The government says the Kafala system doesnt exist but it still does, in practice. There are so many things you think: this must not happen. But it does. And to me Fifa allowed it to happen.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
I spoke to a woman from Human Rights Watch who said Qatari officials have figures but dont publish them. I met a young woman there who tried to show me how open it was and when worker deaths came up, she said the criticism was not justified. She even used the phrase fake news. She doesnt get to see it: she thinks the west is against Qatar. So its difficult to judge how many deaths there have been, but its not three.
Three is the number the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, claimed.
People criticise Qatar, but we have to discuss Fifas role, those from the former executive committee who took the money, Hitzlsperger says. Because if no one would take it, if no one received it, Qatar would have a problem. But the greed in the football business is just immense.
Fifa has since acknowledged these wrongdoings and the need for reform, in the 2017 Garcia report.
There is so much money involved and some people have no morals and just take it. You find a PR agency, you pay them, and they give you a reason. I spoke to Fifas media department. Theyre incredibly nice, kind people but they make you believe theyre trying everything to get the conversation going and it never happens, so they are smart. It would have been easy for Infantino to explain the improvements, the changes, to say why it makes sense to give Qatar the World Cup. Hes smart enough, but he refuses to speak: why? Why arent you more transparent?
Instead, Infantino sent a letter to the 32 national federations telling them to focus purely on the football now. That shows how fed up they are, Hitzlsperger says. The Qatari organisers are too, some suggesting that racism lies beneath criticism.

Thats totally understandable, Hitzlsperger says. Put ourselves in their shoes: theres a point where you say: Look, weve had enough, weve changed. And there has been change, probably more than in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. We have to mention in their defence that theyve spent four years with the blockade as well. Theres probably fear. Hosting a tournament is a way of protecting themselves  as is investing in football clubs. I understand that.
But the price is that it costs lives. And if you bring race into it: prove it, name the people who are racist. We have to understand that they know they can buy whatever they want: you offer people money, they take it. But suddenly there are people saying: We dont want your money.
The question is what can be done now? Hitzlsperger understands that more was not said or done sooner when real change may have been possible  thats just human nature and Im not going to blame journalists as it wasnt on the agenda: why would you talk about Qatar five years ago?  and he has doubts about the efficacy of statements such as the One Love rainbow armband to be worn by 10 captains.
The original idea was to get together among the European federations and come up with the best idea, he says, but the end product is an armband that possibly means a lot but doesnt upset anybody. It becomes generic, people go: What does it mean? Then they move on. It doesnt start a debate. We know the rainbow flag symbol upsets people. People know what it stands for  and some in Qatar dont like it so much. Thats stronger.
There are broader conclusions. The question has been why dont teams boycott the tournament? They cant even agree on an armband, Hitzlsperger says. Besides, this goes beyond sport. Not long ago the German FA president and the interior minister said they had been reassured by the Qatari interior minister that everybody would be safe. And you think: what world are we living in?! That someone has to give a guarantee!
And the message may also be lost in the noise. When its every day even people who agree think: I cant hear this any more, Hitzlsperger concedes. Im trying to find a balance between saying it, refusing to be quiet, and not saying it every day. Its a shame: it destroys part of the game.
Ah, the game. Hitzlsperger talks eloquently about it. He discusses the evolution in the German side since 2008, laughing about how they needed to get rid of him first and recalling a European Championship final where he could not get near Spain. He talks of Jamal Musiala, a player he cant quite stop himself momentarily likening to Lionel Messi, concluding: He said he wants to become one of the best in the world: Id put money on that.
And theres a fondness for the England manager he first met at 18, recalling Gareth Southgate as a player who stood out, smarter, a kind man, a modern leader.
Yet thats the point: for now at least, the game is lost, used and abused, taken from those for whom it is everything. Hitzlsperger is trying to resist, unwilling to let go. I still love football but people come into it who dont know what it means to fans, to players.
Everything changes, money dictates everything. I dont know at what point I will give up, go and watch Sunday league. But I still love it. Its tiring: everything that has happened makes you not want to watch, but they havent managed to kill my passion for the game."

Dr Nasser Mohamed, who lives in the US but retains contact with hundreds of gay Qataris, said that some secret networks had been compromised after arrests by Qatars preventive security department.
A lot [of gay Qataris] dont know about each other, Mohamed said. And its safer that way because when the law enforcement finds one person, they actively try to find their entire network. But some of the people who were captured and physically abused were then recruited as agents.
Now there are agents in the gay community that were promised safety from physical torture in exchange for working for the preventive security department and helping them find groups of LGBTQ+ people.
Mohamed told the Guardian that foreign gay fans in Qatar would not be persecuted while at the World Cup finals tournament. However, he warned that local LGBTQ+ supporters faced a very different reality. What is it like to be an LGBT Qatari? You live in fear, you live in the shadows, youre actively persecuted. Youre subjected to state-sponsored physical and mental abuse. Its dangerous to be an LGBT person in Qatar.
Last month Human Rights Watch reported that Qatars preventive security department forces had arbitrarily arrested lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and subjected them to ill?treatment in detention. HRW also documented six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022.
Rasha Younes, a senior researcher with HRW, told the Guardian that some cases were more striking than most. There was one story of a transgender woman who was detained in solitary confinement for two months underground, lost her job as a result of being detained and was not able to give notice to her employer that she was gone, she said. They shaved her 17-inch long hair in detention, severely beat her until she bled, and denied her medical care.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
HRW is calling for the Qatari authorities to repeal article 285 and all other laws that criminalise consensual sexual relations outside of marriage and introduce legislation that protects against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, online and offline. It also wants freedom of expression and nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity to be guaranteed, permanently, for all residents of Qatar.
Younes also criticised Fifa for failing to do more. Weve been engaging with Fifa with other sports organisations and LGBT rights activists for years and they have not been paying attention, she said. They have not been at all responsive or listen to the accounts that we have shared. Now that we have all this evidence, its really time for Fifa to stop having its fingers in its ears and actually listen.
Fifa said it was committed to inclusivity and that it was confident that all necessary measures will be in place for LGBTIQ+ fans and allies to enjoy the tournament in a welcoming and safe environment, just as for everyone else.
In a statement, Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy promised the World Cup would be free of any discrimination. The SC is committed to delivering an inclusive and discrimination-free Fifa World Cup experience that is welcoming, safe and accessible to all participants, attendees and communities in Qatar and around the world, it said.
Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.
More than 600 international and regional sporting events have been held in Qatar since we were awarded the rights to host the tournament, welcoming thousands of fans from every corner of the world. While the tournament is the biggest event yet, there has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely.
Qatars government has also been invited to comment on the claims made by Mohammed and HRW. A Qatari official has said previously that HRWs allegations contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false, without specifying."

While Cleverly said he understood why some people were uncomfortable with Qatar holding the event, which begins on 20 November, he said it was my job to make sure those people who do visit stay safe.
Concerns have been raised over the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ fans who will travel to support England and Wales in the World Cup, given that same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar.
Tournament organisers have warned against public displays of affection, though have also claimed that everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome.
Cleverly said he had spoken to the Qataris about their legislation on homosexuality. He told MPs on the foreign affairs committee that while we would always promote not just tolerance, but a real embracement of diversity, the default setting for any Briton travelling overseas should be to respect the laws of their host countries.
Challenged over his own attendance by the Labour backbencher Chris Bryant, who is gay, Cleverly said he was going for a number of reasons. Because Im the foreign secretary and it is my job to ensure British visitors stay safe, he said.
Ive visited Qatar in the lead-up to the World Cup, and when I get to the World Cup I will be speaking to the security authorities to ensure that English and Welsh  or whatever other British fans might be going to the World Cup  remain safe.
Cleverly added: I understand there will be people uncomfortable with Qatar hosting the World Cup, I get that  but my job is to make sure those people who do visit stay safe.
Bryant said he did not think anyone should be attending the World Cup apart from the teams, and said gay men in Qatar had been entrapped by police and sent to prison.
Alicia Kearns, a Tory MP and the new chair of the foreign affairs committee, said Cleverly should be more robust about telling Fifa that we expect to see an end of the giving of World Cups to  countries where our people are fundamentally unsafe."

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar, and the host nation has been the subject of criticism for its LGBTQ policies as the World Cup approaches.
The design features seven rainbow-colored vertical stripes below USA in dark blue letters and is part of the Be The Change initiative the team adopted in 2020 with the goal of inspiring action on social justice issues.
When we are on the world stage and when we are in a venue like Qatar, it is important to bring awareness to these issues and that is what Be the Change is about, US coach Gregg Berhalter told a news conference on Monday. It is not just Stateside that we want to bring attention to social issues, it is also abroad. We recognise that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress but theres some work still to do.
Organisers of the World Cup, which is the first to be held in a Middle Eastern nation, say that everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome, while also warning against public displays of affection.
Some players have raised concerns over the rights of fans travelling to this years World Cup, especially LGBTQ individuals and women, whom rights groups say Qatari laws discriminate against.
We are a group who believes in inclusivity and we will continue to project that message going forward, said US goalkeeper Sean Johnson. We have chatted and continue to have discussions as we lead into the games. We have leaned on the message of Be the Change. That is something that we have been proud of and continue to work towards, be impactful with ourselves, our presence and our platform, and we will continue to be so here in Qatar.
The rainbow badge, which will not be worn by the team during World Cup games, has been routinely displayed by US Soccer as a way to promote a spirit of inclusivity.
Our rainbow badge has an important and consistent role in the identity of US Soccer, US Soccer spokesman Neil Buethe told Reuters. As part of our approach for any match or event, we include rainbow branding to support and embrace the LGBTQ community, as well as to promote a spirit of inclusiveness and welcoming to all fans across the globe.
As a result, locations that we will manage and operate at the Fifa World Cup, such as the team hotel, media areas and parties, will feature both traditional and rainbow US Soccer branding.
Meanwhile, Fulham defender Tim Ream and Arsenal goalkeeper Matt Turner are among the US players to receive well-wishes from fictional coach Ted Lasso.

Giant yellow banners began to appear in the home towns of the US players this week, each with a personalised message from Jason Sudeikis TV character.
Ted Lasso follows its eponymous protagonist, a former gridiron coach, as he takes over as coach of English football club AFC Richmond, despite having no experience in the game.

Reams message, placed on a billboard in St Louis, Missouri, reads: Tim, word at the fair is the lights arent shining any place but St Louis, so if you could mail me one of yalls lightbulbs, Id love to check that out.
You know what other shiny thing I cant wait to see? You playin in the big games. There should be a warning before the tournaments to load up on SPF and sunglasses to protect everyone from the Tim Ream beam, I know Ill be doubling up on my visors.
Your tootsie wootsie, Ted Lasso.
Lassos message to Arsenal goalkeeper Turner was hung up outside his alma mater, Saint Joseph Regional High School in New Jersey.

Premier League season on pause while the lower leagues keep chugging away. Knackered and injured players off to a country where its illegal to be gay, where women who are victims of sexual assault can be put in prison and where thousands of migrant workers have died since Qatar was awarded the tournament 12 years ago. Welcome to the World Cup.
Of course, we all know these things by now. In fact the impact of hearing about them again and again seems to numb you from the brutal facts. Its easier to just talk of migrant workers as a homogenous block rather than remembering that each life is a father, a son, a brother  most, but not all, of these are impoverished young men from Asia and Africa.
We have by now also worked out what our relationship is going to be with this World Cup. From a full boycott at one extreme to free flights and tickets in return for some positive tweets and keeping an eye on those around you. Fan by day, Stasi by night.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
This tournament is footballs equivalent of a dirty burger  you know its come from the power-washed off cuts of a cow following a life on death row bunched up with thousands of others before being slaughtered. But you just have to eat it.
Its instinctive to get excited by the World Cup  smiling at that picture of James Maddison with England face paint as kid, losing yourself in Dafydd Iwans Yma o Hyd, or watching the Uruguay squad announcement film and just thinking how much you love football. Theres a beautiful moment where the Australia midfielder Cam Devlin chokes up when he gets the call from his manager, Graham Arnold.
The Guardian Football Weekly podcast has recorded a number of special programmes that well release alongside previews of the tournament this week, specifically on the lives of the LGBTQ+ community, the rights of women and the treatment of migrant workers. The reality for these people has been written about extensively: gay dating apps populated by people masquerading as love interests to arrest or beat up genuine users. Meanwhile women rely on a male guardian for virtually all of their rights. And some of the migrant workforce  female domestic workers can experience a hidden life of abuse and violence, while men live in terrible conditions in insufferable heat  have paid the ultimate price. Whats most striking is how difficult it is to speak to anyone on the record, such is the fear of reprisals.
Unicef ambassador and LGBTQ+ ally David Beckham is being paid a reported £150m over the next 10 years to be an ambassador for Qatar. He has such power and influence that criticism has been thin on the ground from the football world. His support for this tournament legitimises it in the eyes of so many. Its such a grave disappointment, such hypocrisy  a legacy completely tarnished. How much money does he actually need?
Tim Cahill, Cafu, Samuel Etoo, Ronald de Boer and Xavi are all ambassadors, too. All with their name alongside a quote on the website. Its easy to believe in the legacy projects when you see for yourself all the good theyre doing, notes the Barcelona manager. Who to listen to? Xavi or Human Rights Watch? It is almost impossible to find unambiguous support for the tournament from anyone who isnt in some way paid by Fifa or the Qatari state.
Jürgen Klopp was, in part, right that it isnt a footballers responsibility to be a human rights activist, but footballers are humans too. They live in the world. They have the power to do more than just say: Im a football person, I can only talk about football. See the Socceroos powerful video and Jackson Irvines call for LGBTQ+ rights to see how it can be done.
And we are all hypocrites  I dont know the working conditions of whoever made the hard disc on this laptop. I didnt check whether my coffee was fair trade this morning. We can all do better. And there are of course human rights abuses in all countries. But the logical extent argument is that you cant criticise anything without criticising everything.
So can we watch with a clear conscience? Can we feel the agony of Englands defeat in pure footballing terms? Why did Gareth wait until the 115th minute to bring on James Maddison?

And what can we realistically do? How much, if any, lasting change will this World Cup create in Qatar is impossible to know. And we will move on quickly. Oh look, its the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.
But we can at least go into this competition with our eyes open. And focus on Fifa. The #PayUpFifa campaign is worth fighting for, despite Qatars labour minister calling it a publicity stunt. The secretary general of Amnesty, Agnés Callamard, has called on Gianni Infantino to break his silence on the creation of a workers compensation fund of $440m (£370m)  equal to the player prize-money pool. Neither Qatar or Fifa wants to accept responsibility. You fear they wouldnt budge even under a huge wave of pressure. But why not at least try to force their hand?
Fifa has insisted it remains in positive continuing dialogue with labour organisations and the Qatari authorities over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup. It has also said there had been a great response to Infantinos letter calling for teams to focus on the football, with various teams backing it. But that does not answer the question that remains for the rest of us: What should we all do?
Ive been a member of Juan Matas Common Goal for a few years, committed to donating 1% of my annual earnings to charity. For this World Cup Ill give the same again to the families Fifa wont compensate. Its not a huge gesture  perhaps Im just trying to make myself feel better. Some will say thats not enough, that you cant just offset human rights, moreover peoples lives, and they might be right. But its something."

Issuing the challenge, the comedian said he would donate the money to charity if Beckham agreed to cut ties with the World Cup host, but if not, the footballers status as a gay icon will be shredded along with the cash in a livestream next Sunday before the opening ceremony.
Beckham, who has historically supported gay fans and players, will earn as much as £150m as an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup, despite the country outlawing same-sex relationships and concerns over its record on human rights.
The charity Human Rights Watch found as recently as September this year, queer people were being detained without charge  in one case for two months in solitary confinement  and violently and sexually assaulted, under morality laws.

In a video posted on social media and the website benderslikebeckham.com, Lycett opens by saying: This is a message to David Beckham. I consider you, along with Kim Woodburn and Monty Don, to be a gay icon. You were the first premiership footballer to do shoots with gay magazines like Attitude, to speak openly about your gay fans, and you married a Spice Girl which is the gayest thing a human being can do.
He turned to Beckhams deal with Qatar  one of the worst places in the world to be gay  to promote the World Cup.
He said: If you end your relationship with Qatar I will donate 10 grand of my own money to charities that support queer people in football.
However, if you do not I will throw the money into a shredder at midday next Sunday, just before the opening ceremony of the World Cup and stream it right here. Not just the money, but also your status as a gay icon will be shredded.

Beckham has already been criticised by fans, including Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride, the England national teams biggest LGBTQ+ supporters group. She said: Im just so disappointed because we  the LGBTQ+ football family  have put David Beckham on a pedestal, as a great ally.
And then it turns out that hes taking a lot of money to be an ambassador for this World Cup, and thats incredibly disappointing."

Exchange as South Kesteven council embraced LGBT history month.
A year after voting against such a gesture the Lincolnshire local authority declared itself pleased to celebrate and recognise the [] rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, hoisting the flag outside its headquarters in 2019.
Across Britain, many other councils regularly follow suit, showing solidarity with their LGBT residents through their support of events such as Pride marches.
Yet, as a Guardian investigation reveals, at least 28 councils  including South Kesteven  have been quietly depositing more than £1bn of taxpayers money into accounts at Qatar National Bank (QNB), the state lender in a country where fans who display rainbow flags at next months World Cup may have them confiscated for their own protection.
The investments pose a moral dilemma for western institutions dealing with the tiny, gas-rich Gulf emirate  whether to prize financial returns over principles.
Some councils have pulled money out of QNB due to ethical concerns about Qatar, which has said it will welcome LGBT fans but where homosexuality is illegal, women are second-class citizens and migrant workers have died in their thousands.
But others have carried on with the investments, described by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell as shocking.
Investment firms, including Halifax and Hargreaves Lansdown, that flaunt their credentials on diversity, inclusion and labour rights, have also poured cash into accounts with the lender. Halifax does not appear to disclose this publicly.
The investments take the form of funds deposited with QNB, which is 50%-owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the $450bn sovereign wealth fund of the gas-rich emirate.
Amid mounting criticism of Qatars record on human rights, the World Cup offers an opportunity for the emirates ruling elite to secure their place at the top table of global culture, politics and business.
Qatar National Bank has played a key role in laying the groundwork for the sporting extravaganza.
During the event itself, QNB will be the sole provider of cash machines at games in stadiums. More importantly, QNB helped fund the estimated $220bn of the tournament. According to its annual reports, the bank financed the Education City stadium, where nine matches will be played, as well as infrastructure projects to ensure everything goes off without a hitch.
Few people in the UK will suspect that, in paying their council tax, they may have indirectly helped QNB bankroll these investments.
Yet freedom of information requests to every local authority in the UK show that at least 27 have invested more than a combined £1bn with QNB since 2017.
They do so as part of treasury management  effectively the storage of council tax money due to be spent on crucial public services.
Their deposits at QNB, which has just one branch in central London, reflect the search for yield that more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates has foisted on investors, from local authorities to high street banks.
QNB pays a healthy rate of interest  nearly 4% in some cases, according to council disclosures  a useful return for councils struggling with cuts to central funding.
Most told the Guardian that this was in line with their investment strategy. But not everyone in local government appears to agree that depositing cash with QNB is appropriate.
Spokespeople for Trafford and Blaby, both of which have invested in QNB in the past, told the Guardian that they had stopped doing so, citing their ethical investment policies.

Ryedale said it did not have an alternative at the time it did deposit cash with QNB but admitted that the investment had been a mistake and said it would not do so in the future for ethical reasons.
In Reading, the Green party councillor Josh Williams raised an objection to the councils investments in a country with a lamentable human rights record, warning that Reading citizens might draw the conclusion that the council was happy to invest millions of pounds in a country that would imprison homosexual men.
Readings last investment was in July 2022. It says QNBs sustainability policy means it meets the councils investment criteria but that it has suspended further investments.
Councils that still had millions invested with QNB as of October 2022 include South Kesteven, Argyll and Bute, Swindon and Portsmouth.
Its shocking to learn that local authorities are depositing council taxpayers money with a state-controlled bank in such a homophobic country as Qatar, said Tatchell.
Through these deposits, local authorities are supporting a bank that funds the World Cup and sustain a regime that stands accused of human rights abuses against LGBT people, women and migrant workers.
Anyone who invests in shares may also have unwittingly contributed to the volume of cash deposited at QNB.
The Financial Conduct Authoritys client assets sourcebook regime (Cass) requires stockbrokers to deposit customer money with a panel of major banks, to ensure that funds could be recovered if the brokerage went bust.
The banks receiving the deposits typically include well-known UK lenders but some share-dealing brands, including firms that publicly support LGBTQ+ rights, use QNB.
Earlier this year, Halifax won praise when it gave staff the option to display pronouns on their name badges and told customers who objected to the move that they should close their accounts. The bank also espouses its commitment to gender equality.
But the Guardian understands that the lenders share dealing arm, which manages £1.5bn of money on behalf of its clients, has more than £300m with QNB.
Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited under Qatars 2004 penal code, which criminalises acts of sodomy and sexual intercourse between people of the same sex. Women must obtain permission from a male guardian in order to make key decisions about their lives, such as reproductive healthcare or overseas travel, according to a 2021 report by Human Rights Watch.
By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown sponsors Bristol Pride and has won awards at the event thanks to its credentials as an LGBT employer.
Yet the company, which also boasts that it is a living wage employer, deposits up to 8% of clients cash  suggesting a maximum of £1.5bn  with QNB.
Fellow stockbroker AJ Bell also lists QNB among the banks it uses, with a maximum of 35% of client money helped there, implying up to £34m.
Not all stockbrokers publish the panel of banks they use to store clients cash, meaning many more may have deposited funds with QNB.
QNB did not answer requests for comment. Hargreaves Lansdown and Halifax declined to comment.
A spokesperson for AJ Bell said: We evaluate and monitor a number of factors when assessing which banks to use to hold cash, adding that this includes a banks independently assessed ESG or ethical rating."

Irvine has been outspoken on various off-field issues in the past and was instrumental in putting together the Socceroos groundbreaking statement last month that raised collective concerns over Qatars record on human rights.
The ongoing problem of homophobia in football is an issue close to Irvines heart, given he has family and friends who are part of the LGBTQ+ community.
Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, attracting punishments of up to seven years in prison. Last week, the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, insisted that everyone is welcome [at the World Cup] regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality, echoing comments made by the organisers in Qatar.
But Irvine wants clearer messages about inclusivity to come out of the tournament. He said in a new Fifpro global football players association series, #ShineALight, that he wanted to use the global spotlight on players at the tournament to raise awareness of non-football issues.
These few months provide a unique short window of time where the focus is so heavily on us, he said. Its an opportunity not to be wasted because, at the moment, theres a lack of clarity and a feeling the LGBTQIA+ community will be unwelcome at a global tournament.
Irvine spearheaded the Socceroos video statement released at the end of October that raised concerns about the suffering of migrant workers and the inability in Qatar of LGBTQ+ people to love the person that they choose. The video  the first collective statement made by a group of national team players  made headlines across the world.
We, as players, have a big role to play, he said. Education and making information available to those in football is going to play a massively important part, as is us speaking up.
Collective action can come from pressure from individuals to put the sport on that path. I hope to see that collective action at the World Cup. When you play on the biggest stage, in the biggest tournament in the sport, it raises the platform and the attention on individual players and footballers as a collective to speak about issues that matter.
Irvine is the co-captain of St Pauli  the German club known for its social activism and left-leaning political stance  and a member of Professional Footballers Australia, the players union which has been vocal in promoting gay rights.
He said he had noticed a huge change in recent years around the unacceptable and outdated language used in football.
Irvine pointed to his fellow Australian Josh Cavallo as being one of the drivers of that shift. Cavallo became in October last year the only known current male top-flight professional footballer in the world to come out as gay.
Despite education and information on the subject becoming more freely available, there was still a lot of progress to be made, Irvine said.
Were starting to see players come out and receive overwhelmingly supporting reactions from the football community, he said.
Its massively important for players to continue to speak up and use our voices for good  but to do it we need to feel comfortable and supported. Lets be clear here: homophobia in football is still a problem. There are a lot of issues facing sport and football in general  and I think any kind of toxic masculine atmosphere, which football unfortunately has sometimes, doesnt make people from the gay community feel welcome and part of the game. That has to change  and it has to change now."

Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group, said she was disappointed in Beckhams decision to accept a deal  reported to be worth £150m  given that Qatari law criminalises same-sex relationships.
Cunningham was one among those who travelled to Russia for the World Cup in 2018. However, she said that Three Lions Pride would not go to Qatar because there was no sign  as there was in Russia  of any appetite to relax or review the toxic environment there is for LGBTQ+ and other minority groups.
Speaking at a Sport & Rights Alliance press briefing on Wednesday, Cunningham also praised those players who had spoken out in favour of LGBT+ rights in Qatar, before turning her focus on to Beckham, a former England captain.
One of the difficulties is having people taking the money in order to promote Qatar and the World Cup, she said. Im just so disappointed because we  the LGBTQ+ football family  have put David Beckham on a pedestal, as a great ally.
And then it turns out that hes taking a lot of money to be an ambassador for this World Cup, and thats incredibly disappointing. So I really hope that the message has got through that people will be criticised for that.
Meanwhile, Minky Worden from Human Rights Watch urged Fifa to never again go to a country that does not uphold basic human rights. Athletes are effectively hostages, she warned. They are lashed to the ship of Fifa and they have to go wherever the World Cup or the Club World Cup goes. And I think for many fans, athletes and others, the last decade has been a very bitter lesson.
Worden also called for a human rights framework to be put in place for future bids before adding: There can never again be a World Cup that does not uphold basic human rights and puts athletes whose job is their place of work in the invidious position of having to fear for their identity.
We should never again have a World Cup that fails to respect basic human rights and has none of the expected assurances and protections."

For many opposite-sex couples, exploring the world together is one of their great bonding experiences, teeming with adventure and generating a lifetime of soppy memories. For LGBTQ couples, this experience is rather more fraught. There are, after all, 69 countries where homosexuality is prohibited altogether, 11 of which can enforce the death penalty for same-sex attraction.
In many other countries  take your pick: Indonesia, Russia, Madagascar  being gay may be legal, but that doesnt preclude widespread discrimination and stigma. Booking a shared hotel room for you and your partner, or worries about public behaviour outing you as a romantic item, may deter you from most countries borders. As for traveling solo to somewhere like Egypt  now hosting COP27  youd do so likely knowing that authorities there have used dating apps to entrap and persecute LGBTQ people.
Qatar is one of those 69 countries where same-sex relations are forbidden. And yet this did not deter Fifa from awarding the Middle Eastern monarchy this years mens World Cup back in 2010. Despite the regimes claims that LGBTQ fans are welcome, some hotels will refuse to accommodate LGBTQ couples, and the countrys ruling emir made it clear that officials expect and want people to respect our culture. This monarch has found an ally in the British government, as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded that LGBTQ fans be respectful of the host nation. Whether this meant avoiding public displays of affection, or excessively flamboyant twerking to Kylie in a tight white vest, was unclear.
That Qatar was granted this honour with no consideration for the rights of LGBTQ people speaks for itself. Its not as if its a great footballing nation  it clearly isnt  and its successful bid was mired in accusations of corruption. Despite its protestations, in a choice between LGBTQ rights and profit, Fifa is clearly more committed to the latter.
Regimes that brutalise their own people are enthusiastic about hosting great sporting events in large part because they believe it will shore up their reputations. If this was Qatars intention, it has failed: rarely has the run-up to a World Cup been so sapped of enthusiasm, and there has been unprecedented attention on the monarchys human rights abuses. This week, a traumatising story about a gay man who claims he was entrapped on an app and subsequently raped by Qatar police officers was widely reported. Perhaps it would be educational for David Beckham  reportedly to be paid £10m over the next decade to be an ambassador to Qatar so he can tell the world how warm and welcoming it is  to meet this victim.
But while the potential unease suffered by LGBTQ western tourists is important, the fact that thousands of migrant workers  some of whom will be LGBTQ, statistically speaking  have died in Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup deserves far more attention and fury. And while any attention being drawn to the plight of LGBTQ people in Qatar is welcome, should it really require a one-off global sports tournament for this to be the case? Qatar has been repressive while being a western ally for years. And nearby Saudi Arabia beheads people for being gay  as well as brutalising women, murdering dissidents, and slaughtering children in Yemen. Yet Britain and other western states back it to the hilt with arms and diplomatic support. Is the hosting of a sports tournament really the prerequisite for outrage?
Perhaps more controversial, too, is how the global north uses pinkwashing  that is, trumpeting their own records on LGBTQ rights in contrast to other countries  to establish an ill-deserved moral superiority. The most striking example, of course, is Israel: the existence of LGBTQ rights is used to portray the state as a beacon of human rights, helping to deflect attention from, or even justify, its brutal occupation of the Palestinian people, the victims of which are straight and queer alike. And the fact that many states have poor records on LGBTQ rights because of the legacy of the British empire in particular  many African states enforce colonial-era laws  is airbrushed from the discussion altogether.
Focusing solely on the presence or absence of LGBTQ rights can deflect our attention from the wider picture. Given that the United States is jointly hosting the mens World Cup in 2026, what if we expressed our outrage at the countrys use of mass incarceration, which leaves Black Americans nearly five times as likely to be behind bars as their white counterparts? Western states are also more likely to export their human rights abuses abroad, but does that make them less deserving of condemnation? When fans across the globe cheer on their teams in Bostons Gillette Stadium or Seattles Lumen Field in four years time, what if we remembered the hundreds of thousands slaughtered in the Iraq war, or the mass human rights abuses committed in the failed two-decade occupation of Afghanistan?
It seems far easier to express revulsion at the brutal injustices committed in foreign lands than our own homes. This itself is part of the rationale of western hegemony. If we see our own nations as paragons of decency, and the rest of the world as brutal backwaters, we are less likely to scrutinise how western power affects the world.
So yes, we should be clear: Fifas actions appear to show it doesnt care about LGBTQ people and their rights  or at the very least, that it considers them secondary to other cynical calculations. But this is no different from the west at large, whose authorities were only forced to grant queer people their rights because of struggle and sacrifice from below, and which happily ally themselves to murderous anti-LGBTQ regimes abroad. Qatars hosting of the World Cup 2022 deserves the derision it is receiving  but not at the expense of banishing consistency into exile.

Khalid Salman, a former Qatar international footballer, made the comments in an interview with the German broadcaster ZDF.
Asked about the fact that homosexuality is illegal in his country, Salman said: They have to accept our rules here. [Homosexuality] is haram. You know what haram means?
When asked why it was haram, or forbidden, Khalid Salman said: I am not a strict Muslim but why is it haram? Because it is damage in the mind.
Salman was speaking in his capacity as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, a role he shares with a number of football legends including Cafu and Xavi Hernández. Organisers described the role of ambassador as harnessing the power of football to create positive social change in Qatar, across the region and around the globe.
The Ecuador head coach, Gustavo Alfaro, has criticised the decision to bring the World Cup's opening match between his side and hosts Qatar forward by a day, and claimed they were not consulted about the move.
The 2022 World Cup was scheduled to begin with Senegal v Netherlands on 21 November, but organisers decided it would be better for the hosts to kick off the tournament, so the Group A game was moved to Sunday.
'I have one day less of preparation,' Alfaro told a news conference on Tuesday. 'We were overtaken. We were not consulted if there was any problem in bringing forward the match.' The coach also claimed Qatar's players have been able to train together for five months with their national championship suspended.
Ecuador's participation in the World Cup has been clouded by controversy after Chile and Peru accused them of fielding an ineligible player in qualifying. On Tuesday, the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) ruled that Byron Castillo is eligible to play for Ecuador.
The South American side, who finished third in Conmebol qualifying, will be deducted three points in qualifying for 2026. After Cas accepted Castillo was born in Colombia and that false information about his date and place of birth had been used to get an Ecuadorian passport. Reuters
Rasha Younes of the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch said: Salmans suggestion that same-sex attraction is damage in the mind is harmful and unacceptable. The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fuelling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices.
Last month HRW published a report documenting what it claimed was arbitrary police action against LGBTQ+ residents in Qatar, including six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022. A Qatari official said HRWs allegations contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false, without specifying.
Fans hoping to travel to the World Cup have also expressed concerns over safety in the country. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest police will be told not to take action against public displays of affection or those who protest for LGBTQ+ rights.
Last week the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, insisted that everyone is welcome [at the World Cup] regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality, echoing comments made by the organisers in Qatar. The statement came as part of a letter in which he pleaded with football associations and their players to put aside discussion of political and human rights issues surrounding the tournament and let the football take the stage.
Fifa, the World Cup organising Supreme Committee and the Qatari government have been approached for comment."

Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, attracting punishments of up to seven years in prison. Despite this and other serious human rights concerns, Fifa members voted in 2010 to award the 2022 tournament to the Gulf state.
A survey found that 62% of British people believe Qatars stance on gay rights alone should have been enough to bar it from hosting, with support for that position consistent across age, gender and political persuasion. Just 24% believe the countrys laws should not have been a factor, with 14% unsure.
In addition, only 43% of Britons think the England and Wales teams are right to participate in the tournament given Qatars anti-gay laws. Thirty-nine per cent of all those asked believe the teams should not take part, while 18% said they didnt know.
The World Cup, rescheduled for winter to avoid Qatars overwhelming summer heat, kicks off on 20 November with the hosts facing Ecuador.
The survey, conducted between 1 and 3 November by Public First for More in Common, also asked 2,030 adults whether Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, was right in planning to boycott the tournament over Qatars human rights record. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents said he was right, with 12% disagreeing.
Starmer was asked by LBC radio last month whether he planned to attend, and said neither he nor any party colleagues would be there, even if England got to the final. Id love to but the human rights record is such I wouldnt go. That would be the position of the Labour party, he said.
The campaign group Human Rights Watch said last month that Qatari residents risked persecution if they stood up for LGBTQ+ rights, while concerns have also been raised about the safety of foreign gay fans or others showing solidarity by carrying a rainbow flag, for example.
The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been criticised for urging gay fans to show respect to Qatar. He said last month: It is important when you are a visitor to a country that you respect the culture of your host nation. In response, the TV presenter and former footballer Gary Lineker tweeted: Whatever you do, dont do anything Gay. Is that the message?
Lucy Powell, the shadow sport secretary, called Cleverlys comments shockingly tone-deaf, adding: The government should be challenging Fifa on how theyve put fans in this position, and ensuring the full safety of all fans attending, not defending discriminatory values.

The gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell accused Cleverly of colluding with a homophobic, sexist and racist regime.
The poll found that 44% thought Cleverly was right to call on fans to be respectful and 34% felt he was wrong, with 24% undecided. Cleverly has said he intends to attend the tournament.
Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, said: The British public clearly thinks that Qatars position on LGBT rights was a reason not to award the World Cup to that country  The clear message from the public to Fifa is that in picking future tournament venues, human rights considerations should be front and centre.,"

Fans should be allowed to climb on tables, drape flags over statues and sing loud songs in public without facing interventions by police, according to a summary of the agreements seen by the Guardian. Essential areas of individual rights are also covered, with LGBTQ+ fans to be allowed to show displays of affection in the street and fly rainbow flags in public places, despite laws that mean homosexuality is illegal in the Gulf state.
With the opening match of the World Cup just over two weeks away, fans and football associations continue to face uncertainty over how supporters will be treated in Qatar. This is especially true of policing, much of which will be subcontracted by Qatar to Turkish and Pakistani law enforcement. This week British police said they would be taking 15 supporter engagement officers to the tournament to help avoid cultural misunderstandings. But unpublished results of discussions between Fifa and representatives of the Qatari Safety and Security Operations Committee (SSOC) shows there are a number of areas in which police will be expected to show leniency towards behaviours that do not threaten physical integrity or property.
In a section headlined fans, the document lays out instances in which police should not intervene in specific detail. Standing on a table/chair/bench and chanting a fan song in public: no action, no prosecution, reads one entry. Covering sculptures, etc. with fan flags and banners in public: no action, no prosecution, is another.
The document is understood to be a distillation of a lengthy meeting in which Fifa officials sought to obtain firm answers on how policing might be conducted during the tournament. Some elements emphasise the wide gap between western expectations of the law and the norms in Qatar.
One section, marked womens rights, states: Women will be able to receive medical care including related to pregnancy or reproductive health regardless of the circumstances and will not face any accusations. This statement is likely a response to laws that mean consenting sex outside of marriage remains illegal in Qatar. The document goes on to say: Women will not face any accusations if they report rape or sexual harassment/violence.
Qataris have come under intense pressure to ensure the safety of LGBTQ+ people travelling to the tournament. The document makes no mention of the possibility of amending the penal code, one demand made of the World Cup hosts, but under a section marked public norms it says: Visitors can stay in the same room regardless of marital status or gender.
On the issue of protest around LGBTQ+ rights, the document says: Persons displaying the rainbow or other sexual identity flags will neither be approached, detained nor prosecuted. It also confirms that people should be allowed to kiss and hold hands in public places or in stadiums without interference.

A lack of public commitment from the hosts to greater tolerance for the duration of the tournament has caused concerns to rise among supporters intending to travel as well as those in marginalised groups. The latest news comes after it was revealed that hundreds of fans will be travelling to the tournament at the expense of Qatari authorities who, in return, will ask that individuals do not make critical remarks in public about the tournament.
Fifa would not comment on the document when approached by the Guardian, and a statement provided by the Supreme Committee in charge of implementing the World Cup said: We are aware of a Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 document regarding fan behaviour circulating on social media. This document was not developed or approved by the SC or any other State of Qatar entity."

Federal minister for sport, Anika Wells, backed the mens national football team for raising their concerns, while Amnesty International and former Socceroos captain Craig Foster have also supported the video campaign.
The Socceroos have a powerful platform at the World Cup to positively impact the lives of others and create meaningful change, Wells said.
Qatar will host the World Cup between November and December. Controversy has surrounded the Middle Eastern nations preparations for the tournament, including the deaths and mistreatment of workers building stadiums, and attention on Qatars criminalisation of same-sex relationships.
The Australian mens national team released a video on Thursday morning with 16 players delivering their message line by line, raising concerns about the suffering of migrant workers and the inability for LGBTQ+ people in Qatar to love the person that they choose.
The Socceroos video was released alongside an open letter from the players union, Professional Footballers Australia (Pfa), and a statement from the governing body, Football Australia, addressing the same concerns.
There are universal values that should define football values such as respect, dignity, trust, and courage. When we represent our nation, we aspire to embody these values, the players said.
The video campaign was met with praise from politicians and sporting figures on Thursday. Wells, who has recently supported athletes raising concerns about sponsorship, backed the Socceroos.

It is important players in sporting organisations have a platform to raise their voice and share concerns about issues that impact them in the workplace, she said.
We agree wholeheartedly with their view that football is a game for everyone.
The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, described the players as gutsy.
I think theyre representing Australian values on the international stage. Im proud of them, she told Sky News.
The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, reportedly also told Sky: These guys make me proud to be an Australian.

We welcome this strong statement from the Socceroos and [the Pfa] alongside their commitment to listening and learning, and to standing up for human rights and for the LGBTQIA+ community and migrant workers in Qatar, Amnesty tweeted.
Pride Football Australia, a group promoting LGBTQ+ issues in the sport, tweeted: The first nation to speak out. But hopefully not the last.

Raising the rainbow flag, engaging in chants or even liking pro-LGBTQ+ content on social media may leave a trail of evidence that could be used to persecute individuals once the World Cup has ended, according to Rasha Younes of HRWs LGBT rights program.
She said: As Qatar advances its surveillance capabilities including inside football stadiums, the possibility of LGBT Qataris being persecuted for publicly supporting LGBT rights will remain long after the fans have gone. If an individual were even to retweet a post about affirmative LGBT rights this individual could be targeted long after the World Cup is over and in ways that we may not have access to.
Concerns have long been raised over the safety of LGBTQ+ visitors to Qatar during the World Cup. This week the campaigner Peter Tatchell claimed he had been arrested in the country for protesting for LGBTQ+ freedoms.
There have also been mixed messages from the UK government over how fans should approach any visit to the country for the tournament, with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, suggesting on Wednesday that they should modify their behaviour, with a little bit of flex and compromise. On Thursday, the Conservative party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, appeared to contradict Cleverly, saying: The policies of the government of Qatar are not our policies, nor would we condone them.
Residents have long faced discrimination from the state. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with punishments of up to seven years in jail possible. This week HRW published a report which documented what it claimed was arbitrary police action against LGBTQ+ residents, including six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022.
A Qatari official said HRWs allegations contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false, without specifying.
Younes said that those within football should listen to concerns from LGBTQ+ supporter groups but that the risk faced by locals was greater. LGBT residents of Qatar are the people we are most concerned about, she said. There needs to be an honouring of expression during the World Cup. But we also know that in any potential crackdown against individuals beyond the World Cup the people who are the most affected are going to be the LGBT residents of Qatar.
This needs to be factored into any policies, any concrete interventions that Fifa undertakes, or the Supreme Committee [the body in charge of organising the World Cup] or any coalitions, in terms of affording protections for the LGBT residents of Qatar who may face any grievances.

The Supreme Committee said: The Fifa World Cup will be a tournament for everyone  much like previous editions of the tournament.
Everyone will be welcome to Qatar in 2022, regardless of their race, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality.
We are a relatively conservative society  for example, public displays of affection are not a part of our culture. We believe in mutual respect and so whilst everyone is welcome, what we expect in return is for everyone to respect our culture and traditions."

Nadhim Zahawi told LBC Radio that no one should have to compromise on their identity if they wanted to attend the tournament. He said: I would say you should not compromise on your identity or your sexuality or your sexual preference in any way. Of course you are safe to go to the World Cup. No one should have to compromise at all in my view.
I am very proud of what we have done in the UK. We use every opportunity when we engage with the Qatari government to share with them how we do things here. They have had a different historical journey but football is a celebration of diversity. I am sure the Qataris completely understand this as well.
No one should need to compromise on their sexuality or their preference whatsoever.
Zahawis comments seemingly contradict those made by James Cleverly, his cabinet colleague, who on Wednesday said gay football fans should show respect to Qatar.
Cleverly had said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, saying: I have spoken to the Qatari authorities in the past about gay football fans going to watch the World Cup and how they will treat our fans and international fans.
He added: They want to make sure that football fans are safe, secure and enjoy themselves. And they know that that means they are going to have to make some compromises in terms of what is an Islamic country with a very different set of cultural norms to our own.
One of the things I would say for football fans is, you know, please do be respectful of the host nation. They are trying to ensure that people can be themselves and enjoy the football, and I think with a little bit of flex and compromise at both ends, it can be a safe, secure and exciting World Cup.
The tournament, which will be held in Qatar from 20 November, has faced criticism due to Qatars poor human rights record and its treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, with homosexuality illegal.

The Australian mens national team released a video on Thursday morning with 16 players delivering their message line by line, raising concerns about the suffering of migrant workers and the inability in Qatar of LGBTI+ people to love the person that they choose.
Ryan and teammate Jackson Irvine have previously aired their individual views on human rights issues in Qatar, but this is the first time a collective players voice has been heard in the buildup to the tournament.
There are universal values that should define football values such as respect, dignity, trust, and courage. When we represent our nation, we aspire to embody these values, the players said.
The Socceroos video was released alongside an open letter from the players union Professional Footballers Australia and a statement from the governing body Football Australia addressing the human rights and workers welfare concerns which have been raised around the host nation.
The 16 Australian players involved in the video are Ryan, Irvine, Bailey Wright, Jamie Maclaren, Nick DAgostino, Craig Goodwin, Danny Vukovic, Andrew Redmayne, Mathew Leckie, Mitchell Duke, Mitch Langerak, Denis Genreau, Cameron Devlin, Adam Taggart, Kye Rowles and Alex Wilkinson, the president of Professional Footballers Australia.
In the video, they said we have learned that progress has been made both on paper and in practice.
They highlighted that the kafala system (which enabled employers to take away workers passports and block them from leaving the country) has largely been dismantled, that working conditions have improved and a minimum wage has been established.
However, the players said while the reforms are an important and welcome step, their implementation remains inconsistent and requires improvement.
These migrant workers who have suffered are not just numbers. Like the migrants that have shaped our country and our football, they possess the same courage and determination to build a better life, they said.
Addressing these issues is not easy. And we do not have all the answers. We stand with Fifpro, the Building and Wood Workers International and the International Trade Union Confederation, seeking to embed reforms and establish a lasting legacy in Qatar.
This must include establishing a migrant resource centre, effective remedy for those who have been denied their rights, and the decriminalisation of all same-sex relationships.
These are the basic rights that should be afforded to all and will ensure continued progress in Qatar. This is how we can ensure a legacy that goes well beyond the final whistle of the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
PFA said its members views may not be universally popular, but acknowledged that they had been put in an unenviable position by decisions made by the games administrators.

Some will believe they have not gone far enough whilst others will call on them to stick to football and stay out of politics, despite this being a matter of human rights, a joint statement from PFA CEOs Kathryn Gill and Beau Busch read.
This polarity says much about the courage of the players and also the increasingly fractured nature of the world. As we near kick-off, the players of every nation will continue to be asked about their position on Qatar.
Acknowledging that the players did not award the World Cup host country is critical. They have no say in its delivery and operations. In the absence of leadership from administrators tasked with awarding hosting rights and managing the tournament, it has fallen to players, coaches and fans to provide moral leadership.
Football Australia, which had until Thursday remained silent on the issue of hosting the tournament in Qatar, also called for the establishment of a Migrant Workers Centre to continue to represent the rights of the workers beyond December 2022, as well as solidarity with LGBTI+ communities.
As the most multicultural, diverse, and inclusive sport in our country, we believe everyone should be able to feel safe and be their true authentic selves, the statement said.
Whilst we acknowledge the highest levels of assurances given by HH Amir of Qatar and the president of Fifa that LGBTI+ fans will be safely welcomed in Qatar, we hope that this openness can continue beyond the tournament.
Other teams plan protests in Qatar, with the Socceroos Group D opponents Denmark producing an all-black playing shirt to honour the workers who died during the construction of stadiums and infrastructure, while players from nine teams will wear One Love armbands."

Cleverly said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, which kicks off on 20 November. On Tuesday, the prominent British LGBTQ campaigner Peter Tatchell claimed he had been arrested in Qatar for highlighting the countrys stance.
Cleverly said: I have spoken to the Qatari authorities in the past about gay football fans going to watch the World Cup and how they will treat our fans and international fans. They want to make sure that football fans are safe, secure and enjoy themselves. And they know that that means they are going to have to make some compromises in terms of what is an Islamic country with a very different set of cultural norms to our own.

They are trying to ensure that people can be themselves and enjoy the football, and I think with a little bit of flex and compromise at both ends, it can be a safe, secure and exciting World Cup.
The broadcaster and former England footballer Gary Lineker asked: Whatever you do, dont do anything gay. Is that the message?
Lineker, whose 10 World Cup goals make him the joint-eighth goalscorer in tournaments history, said recently he hoped a Premier League player felt sufficiently comfortable to come out during this years competition to send a strong message to Qatar.
Lucy Powell, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, called Cleverlys comments shockingly tone-deaf.
She said: Sport should be open to all. Many fans will feel they cant attend this tournament to cheer on their team because of Qatars record on human rights, workers and LGBT+ rights. The government should be challenging Fifa on how theyve put fans in this position, and ensuring the full safety of all fans attending, not defending discriminatory values.
Cleverly said he had not spoken with the Qatari government about the case of Tatchell, who was stopped in the Qatari capital, Doha, on Tuesday while staging a protest over LGBTQ rights. Cleverly told LBC radio he understood that the campaigner had been questioned and was being supported by the Foreign Offices consular team.
He said he would attend the World Cup if his diary allowed, and he criticised the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for saying he would refuse to do so because of Qatars record on homosexuality and other human rights issues. The Labour Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, reportedly plans to attend the tournament.
Tatchell hit back at Cleverly, claiming that attending the tournament would amount to colluding with a homophobic, sexist and racist regime. He said: The UK government must use its public voice to condemn the appalling human rights abuses carried out daily by the Qatari regime.
Unless we all speak out, Qatar will have achieved its goal of sportswashing its appalling reputation during the World Cup. Cleverly has an opportunity to highlight the abuses being carried out by the regime. All fans, not just LGBTs, should boycott the World Cup and use their social media to amplify the shocking human rights abuses by the Qatari state.
The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: The World Cup should be a celebration of the beautiful game; instead its being used by countries like Qatar to sportswash their atrocious human rights records. Any UK officials who attend should be using their position to highlight human rights abuses, not endorsing the regime."

The former England striker Lineker told the Daily Mirror he knows of two gay Premier League players, saying they had been very close to coming out before now.
It would be great if one or two of them came out during the World Cup. It would be amazing, Lineker said. I know for a fact that some have been very close and contemplated it. Theres a couple I know, but obviously its not for me to say who they are.
Jake Daniels of Blackpool and the Australian Josh Cavallo of Adelaide United are the highest-profile current male players to have come out. Asked why more had not followed, Lineker said: Fear. Fear of the unknown, I imagine. Perhaps they are worried what their teammates might think, although they probably already know. It seems insane that it should even be a thing.
People say: Yeah, but the crowds. And I say: Well the crowds chant anyway. Youre always going to get a few idiots. But its easy for me to say as Im not in that position.
Lineker had hoped Cavallo and Daniels would prompt other players to come out, and suggested the first Premier League player to do so would make themselves more marketable.
I was hoping, because there are lots of players that are having to live a lie, he said. Im sure its very difficult. But I think what weve seen so far is that the feedback and the response, it will be incredibly positive.
If I were an agent of a big footballer, if I knew one of my players was gay, if he was a top player, Id say: Be the first big player. I mean, as an agent, thinking in terms of promotion and stuff, youre going to be huge.
The television presenter said the BBCs coverage of the World Cup would cover the controversy around Qatar as a host nation  including its record on human rights and the migrant workers who built the stadiums.
Im sure well do it on the first night, he said. Obviously, were not going to do it in every buildup to every game, but of course well talk about it and openly."

For once the PR hype is justified, and not only because the matches will be played during the lead-up to Christmas rather than in summer. The decision to stage the planets biggest sporting event in a country with a notoriously poor human rights record is provoking unprecedented queasiness among competing nations.
Last week, in conjunction with the kit manufacturer Hummel, the Danish football federation unveiled a plain all-black third kit for the tournament. It was designed, said Hummel, in memory of the many migrant workers who died during construction work in the years leading up to the finals. The captains of some European teams  including Englands Harry Kane  aim to wear rainbow One Love armbands, symbolising opposition to discrimination in a country where homosexual acts are illegal. The German federation invited a gay fan to use its platform at an event to address the Qatari ambassador on the subject of LGBT rights. Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani reportedly responded that human rights issues were distracting from the tournament.
To the extent that this is true, it is of course a good thing. High-profile gestures by companies such as Hummel are far better than nothing at all. But time is running out for the kind of action that could leave a lasting positive legacy from a World Cup that should never have been awarded to these hosts. Football is a global game and a tournament in the Middle East is desirable in principle, but this is not the way.
With justification, Qatari authorities claim they have responded to pressure to reform brutally exploitative conditions for migrant workers. The hated kafala system, for example  which tied a worker to a single employer  has gone, and attempts have been made to compensate for unpaid wages and introduce minimum pay. But the latest in a series of Guardian investigations, published last month, found that, despite high-level initiatives and reassurances, abusive practices were still rife on the ground. Migrant workers at the Al Bayt stadium, where England will play the USA on 25 November, had been obliged to pay huge illegal recruitment fees and lived for months in unfit, overcrowded accommodation, earning £1 an hour. Elsewhere, labourers spoke of 12-hour shifts, six days a week, without proper overtime pay. A climate of fear inhibited many from speaking out about conditions. Migrant workers who have returned home ahead of the World Cup say they were sent back before finishing their contracts or without receiving all they claim they were owed.
A recent YouGov poll, commissioned by Amnesty International, found huge support for a compensation fund for migrant workers who have been mistreated, and for the relatives of those who died. Amnesty, along with other human rights groups, are campaigning for Fifa, world footballs governing body, to set up such a fund using a fraction of anticipated profits of $7bn. The amount proposed is $440m  equivalent to World Cup prize money on offer. After prolonged hesitation, the English FA has now backed the principle of a fund, as have high-profile figures in football such as the Dutch national team manager, Louis van Gaal, and the Brazil coach, Tite. Fifa has said it is thinking about it. Its time to stop thinking and act."

The call from the Three Lions Pride group comes a day after the Football Association said it had sought, and received, reassurances that gay supporters who held hands and anyone who waved a rainbow flag would not be prosecuted.
While welcoming the FAs efforts, Three Lions Prides co-founder, Joe White, said that Qatars authorities needed to state publicly that gay fans would be completely protected because ultimately they are the ones who can enforce or suspend laws.
We appreciate the lengthy work the FA has done behind the scenes on engaging with the Supreme Committee, but there are still more assurances and details required for us to best support any fans attending who may wish to show solidarity with the LGBT+ community, White said.
As far as our membership is concerned, there are no LGBT+ people attending with the England Supporters Travel Club for the World Cup and members either didnt apply for the ballot or returned them due to feeling unsafe and uncertain given the lack of reassurances by Fifa and Qatars Supreme Committee.
When asked whether they knew of any gay England fans travelling to Qatar, White said: Im not aware of any going out for the tournament. I cant guarantee there arent some LGBT+ fans going, though I highly doubt it from the conversations Ive had.
Football has also been urged to do more by the LGB Alliances Kate Barker, who said that some of its campaigns to support gay rights at the World Cup, such as captains of national teams wearing a OneLove armband, risked appearing performative when there was still so much uncertainty over safety.
The fact homosexuality is illegal in Qatar means that it is a pretty precarious and dangerous to suggest that gay fans will definitely be safe without firm guarantees that is the case, she said.
A similar warning was conveyed by the gay Liverpool fan Paul Amann, who visited Qatar for the Club World Championship in 2019. The Qatari authorities have not delivered on anything that moves people towards a more inclusive World Cup, he said. In fact, the activities of the state since my visit have clearly indicated a very hard line that will see LGBT+ people in real jeopardy if they attend.
Liz Ward, director of programmes at Stonewall, said she was encouraged by the FAs stance. As we approach the 2022 mens World Cup, we must remember that Qatar is a country where LGBTQ+ people are persecuted simply for being themselves, she said. Sadly, this years tournament is not safe for everyone, which is why its so important to see Harry Kane, alongside many other captains, pledging to wear an anti-discrimination armband.
The German club Hoffenheim, who are fourth in the Bundesliga, have said they will not give any coverage to the World Cup because of the difficulty in providing what they describe as urgently required analytical commentary contextualising the sporting events in the country.

The FA has also been told that supporters with rainbow flags will not be arrested  as long as supporters do not disrespect the local culture and norms by draping them over mosques.
Qatars laws, which criminalise same-sex relationships, have raised considerable concern among LGBT+ fans who fear for their safety at the finals this winter.
Although those laws will stay in place during the tournament, the FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said he had been encouraged by talks with the Qataris  as well as the introduction of an enabling law for the World Cup, under which minor offences will not prosecuted.
On a day when it was announced that the England captain, Harry Kane, will wear an anti-discrimination armband in Qatar as part of the FAs plans to highlight human rights, Bullingham was asked what would happen if any England LGBT+ fans were arrested for holding hands at the finals tournament.
We absolutely have been asking those questions of the Qatari authorities over the last six months, Bullingham replied. But the laws youre referring to actually get suspended for a period of time before the World Cup, so the actions you are referring to arent illegal.
Bullingham also appeared to broadly praise the Qatari authorities for listening to the FAs concerns over LGBT+ issues, saying: Theyve absolutely told us all the right answers for anything weve talked about, even down to are our rainbow flags allowed?
Yes, absolutely, as long as someone doesnt go and drape them on the outside of a mosque  that was one example we were given  and were disrespectful in that way. They have absolutely been briefed to be very tolerant and act in the right way.
Despite Bullinghams upbeat tone it remains highly unclear where the bar for a minor offence will be set  whether that is kissing in public or even holding hands. Sources close to the Qatar authorities continue to maintain that fans will still have to respect the local culture, where public displays of affection are frowned upon, and have been opaque in confirming where the line will be drawn.
Bullingham also conceded he had met the Three Lions Pride supporters group, which advocates for Englands LGBT+ fans, and some were still worried about travelling to Qatar.
We understand their concerns, Bullingham said. We met with them and I understand quite a few of them wont be going out.
The message we have had from Qatar overall is that everyone is welcome and those communities are absolutely welcome. Where they have been a bit frustrated is that they have asked several follow-up questions and not got the answers.
I think a few of them feel they have timed out in terms of getting the information they need to know they are safe on the ground, he said. We have asked the question in lots of meetings with the security teams on the ground and they all give the right answers, but there is certainly more information needed.
The FA is also calling for Fifa and the World Cup organisers to ensure families of migrant workers who have lost their lives or have been injured in construction projects receive compensation.
Less than two months before the tournament starts, the issue of human rights in Qatar remains an ongoing concern. The Guardian has highlighted how workers employed on World Cup-related projects are earning a basic wage of 1,000 riyals (£225) a month, the equivalent of about £1 an hour.
Amnesty has also called on Fifa to set aside at least $440m for the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar who have suffered human rights abuses during preparations for the World Cup  the same as the prize money due to be handed out at the competition."

The Guardian this week presented the Supreme Committee, the body in charge of organising the World Cup, with a series of direct questions related to LGBTQ+ fans and their concerns, but received no specific answers.
The questions included whether:
LGBTQ+ people would be protected by Qatari authorities if threatened because of their sexuality.
Articles of the Qatari penal code, including those which outlaw leading, instigating or seducing a male in any way to commit sodomy, would be suspended during the tournament.
Fans carrying rainbow flags would be allowed to take them into stadiums.
The Supreme Committee would specifically welcome LGBTQ+ people as World Cup visitors.
A general reply said: Everyone will be welcome to Qatar in 2022, regardless of their race, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality. We are a relatively conservative society  for example, public displays of affection are not a part of our culture. We believe in mutual respect and so whilst everyone is welcome, what we expect in return is for everyone to respect our culture and traditions.
The Guardian approached a representative of Qatars government communications office with the first two of those questions and received no response.
Fears over safety have been rising among LGBTQ+ supporter groups as dialogue with organisers has stalled. Anne Lieberman, a founding member of the LGBTIQ Human Rights Sports Coalition, said the group had been in discussion with Qatari authorities for nearly two years but had yet to receive categorical safety assurances.
This quite clearly suggests to us that LGBTIQ people, whatever their role, will not be protected from the state and its repressive anti-LGBTIQ legislation, or from other potential risks to their safety, Lieberman said.
An unwillingness on the part of Qatari authorities to address concerns directly, or even to mention the term LGBTQ+, has led to a situation where groups are effectively recommending a boycott of the tournament.
Lou Englefield of the organisation Football v Homophobia said: I know of no European LGBTIQ supporters group, or individual supporters, who are currently planning to attend this World Cup. The position of the Supreme Committee is just not in keeping with the undertakings they must have given to Fifa. How can an international sporting event which expects millions of visitors not be open to reassuring a large minority group who have well-founded fears that they will be safe and welcome? We have never seen anything like this.
Fifa told the Guardian it believed it had received sufficient assurances from Qatari authorities regarding fan safety and the application of the law, although no specific details were shared.
In a letter to the Human Rights Sports Coalition seen by the Guardian, Fifas Joyce Cook, then the chief social responsibility and education officer and now a senior adviser, said the governing body had thoroughly assessed the named legal clauses and their implementation in practice, including in particular as they pertain to LGBTIQ+ persons.
She wrote: Based on our engagement with the relevant Qatari authorities, and following existing government guarantees, and the event-specific legislation, as well as our experience of hosting other events in Qatar, Fifa is confident that persons identifying as LGBTIQ+ will not face any repercussions based on the above mentioned legal provisions.
LGBTQ+ organisations say a lack of specifics and public communication has reinforced concerns. Even the issue of whether fans will be able to fly rainbow flags in Doha without repercussions remains unresolved.
According to Lieberman: Fifa has had a responsibility from the beginning to ensure the proper human rights due diligence was done, and a positive legacy for all is left, and now we are less than 150 days out still fighting for basic safety assurances.
Last Thursday Fifa published figures showing 1.8m tickets have been sold for the World Cup, which begins on 21 November. It is an increase of a million on the previous total and remaining tickets will be available on a first come, first served basis from Tuesday. Fans interested in an unforgettable trip of a lifetime to Qatar are being urged to act swiftly before the coveted seats are snapped up, Fifa said."

Fifa, the games world governing body, and FifPro, the global players union, published an independent report on Saturday to coincide with the United Nations International Day for Countering Hate Speech in which rising levels of discriminatory posts on social media surrounding international fixtures are highlighted.
As a result, they have teamed up to launch a dedicated in-tournament moderation service across mens and womens football that will scan recognised hate-speech terms and prevent offending messages from being seen by the intended recipient and their followers.
Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, said: Our duty is to protect football, and that starts with the players who bring so much joy and happiness to all of us by their exploits on the field of play.
Unfortunately, there is a trend developing where a percentage of posts on social media channels directed towards players, coaches, match officials and the teams themselves is not acceptable, and this form of discrimination  like any form of discrimination  has no place in football.
With the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 and Fifa World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023 on the horizon, Fifa and FifPro recognise it is important to make a stand and to include what is monitored on social media with what is already being monitored in the stadiums.
We want our actions to speak louder than our words and that is why we are taking concrete measures to tackle the problem directly.
The report, which used artificial intelligence to track more than 400,000 posts on social media platforms during the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020  England trio Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were abused after missing in the penalty shoot-out which decided the final  and this years Africa Cup of Nations, revealed more than half of the players involved were subjected to some form of discrimination.
Much of the abuse came from their respective home nation with 40% of it homophobic and 38% racist in nature, and the majority of it remains visible. The report also suggests the holders of 90% of the accounts responsible are identifiable and therefore their actions could be elevated to the social media platforms and police.
FifPro president David Aganzo said: Online abuse is a societal issue and as an industry, we cannot accept that this new form of abuse and discrimination affects so many people including our players.
Under the initiative, Fifa and FifPro will also provide educational support and mental-health advice to players during major tournaments."

A Scandinavian media survey showed that three of the 69 hotels on Fifas official list of recommended accommodation will deny entry to same-sex couples. Twenty other hotels said they would accommodate them as long as they did not publicly show that they were gay, and 33 hotels had no problem with booking same-sex couples.
Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, which will host the World Cup from 21 November to 18 December. Fifa said that, since being made aware of the report, it had been in touch with the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) and will ensure that the hotels mentioned are once again made aware of our strict requirements in relation to welcoming guests in a non-discriminatory manner.
Hotels, as well as any other service provider associated with the Fifa World Cup, who fail to comply with the high standards set by the organisers will have their contracts terminated.
On top of that, the said requirements will continue to be reinforced in awareness-raising sessions and subsequently monitored and evaluated through audits and inspections of hotels linked to the Fifa World Cup.
Qatar is fully aware of its responsibility to adhere to Fifas expectations and requirements on human rights, equality and non-discrimination. Qatar is committed to ensuring that everyone will be able to enjoy the tournament in a safe and welcoming environment, to building bridges of cultural understanding and to creating an inclusive experience for all participants, attendees and local communities, including from the LGBTQI+ community.
The SC said on Thursday that Qatar was a conservative country but was committed to delivering an inclusive Fifa World Cup experience that is welcoming, safe and accessible to all. Wyndham Grand Regency Doha, The Torch Doha and Magnum Hotel & Suites Westbay were the three hotels mentioned in the report.
While observing and respecting the law of Qatar, Wyndham Grand Regency Doha does not in any way discriminate against guests of any background and aspires to deliver the highest guest satisfaction, which will only be possible by treating everyone fairly and equally, the hotel told Reuters. The Torch referred to the SC statement when asked about their policy for same-sex couples, while Magnum Hotel & Suites did not respond immediately to a Reuters request for comment."

Same-sex relationships are directly criminalised under the laws of the Gulf state, leading to concerns over the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people visiting the country for the tournament and those from that community who reside there.
An international grouping of 16 organisations focused on LGBTQ+ rights has issued eight action points to the tournament organisers Fifa and the local organising committee.
These include repealing laws that target LGBTQ+ people, providing explicit safety guarantees to members of the community, guaranteed right of entry to Qatar, the communication of a clear welcome and of the right to free expression and ensuring there is no censorship or ban on the discussion of LGBTQ+ issues.
The group said in a letter sent to the PA news agency that Fifa had responded in writing but that Qatars Supreme Committee, in charge of World Cup delivery, had not yet.
Progress has been slow, reassurances about the safety of LGBTIQ+ people and the mechanisms in place to ensure safety have not been adequate, the letter stated. If acknowledgement of the issues facing LGBTIQ+ people in Qatar and reassurances of safety cannot be offered, we will be forced to question if the risk facing LGBTIQ+ people wanting to attend or work at the World Cup in Qatar is too high.
Further meetings are planned with both Fifa and the Supreme Committee in the coming weeks where it is hoped progress can be made.
The letter added that a failure to act in the run-up to the tournament could be viewed as an endorsement of the laws as they stand and make life for LGBTQ+ visitors and residents even tougher in the future.
The groups who co-signed the letter were Athlete Ally, Discover Football, the European Gay and Lesbian Sports Association, the Fare network, the Federation of Gay Games, Football v Homophobia, Hidayah, the International Supporters Council, ILGA World, ILGA Asia, Leap Sports, Pride House International, MantiQitna, Mosaic, Queer Khaleeji and You Can Play.
Nassar al-Khater, the Qatar World Cup chief executive, has previously said: I would like to assure any fan, of any gender, [sexual] orientation, religion, race to rest assured that Qatar is one of the most safe countries in the world  and theyll all be welcome here.
He talked then about a lot of training going into security personnel and said: Public displays of affection is frowned upon, its not part of our culture  but that goes across the board to everybody."

It seems certain that Gareth Southgates squad will issue a collective message challenging the stance taken by this years World Cup host country towards the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and the migrant workers responsible for building the stadiums on show at Qatar 2022 among much other infrastructure.
When we were given the briefing, which was really important, it was quite shocking and disappointing, said the Liverpool captain as he prepared for a role in Southgates midfield against Switzerland at Wembley on Saturday. Its horrendous really when you look at some of the issues that are currently happening and have been happening over there.
As a team were just sort of digesting that, coming up with ideas of what we want to do going forward because its an opportunity to maybe shine a light on the issues and use our platforms to make change for the better.
Southgate was joined by Mark Bullingham, the FAs chief executive, and Edleen John, its director of international relations, on Tuesday as they spent 30 minutes relaying detailed information from, among other sources, Amnesty to the squad at St Georges Park. Its provoked a lot of conversations among the players, Englands manager said. The FA have never stopped anybody speaking about these matters  And it would be dangerous for us to be telling them what to do on something like this; they have their own thoughts, their own minds, theyre bright people.
Despite his evident concerns about the human rights landscape in Doha and beyond, Southgate is adamant that boycotting the Middle Easts first World Cup would have been pointless. I dont really know what that achieves, he said. It would be a big story but the tournament would go ahead.
There are some things that are religious and cultural that are going to be very difficult to change but theres still an opportunity to use our voices and our platform in a positive way.
In contrast, an England boycott would have achieved nothing, he said. Unfortunately the biggest issue thats non-religious and non-cultural is what happened with the building of the stadiums, said Southgate. Theres nothing we can do about that either, sadly.
Globalisation and geopolitical reality also come into play. Is the stance against Qatar as a country? he queried. Should we protest against a country or a specific issue? If its Qatar as a country were intertwined. Are we going to stop shopping at Sainsburys [whose largest shareholder is Qatar Holdings LLC] as a protest? Then theres the Shard; theres all sorts of Qatari property investment here. Were in such a complex world of deals, as weve seen with Saudi Arabia.
On one hand people are questioning their investment in Newcastle and on the other hand were going to Saudi and asking them to reduce the oil prices so we can get our petrol cheaper. Its extremely complicated.
After pointing out that the time to talk potential boycotts was the moment Qatar was awarded the tournament in 2010, Southgate advocated the benefits of engagement. It [a boycott] is possible, he said. But thats not a decision the players and myself can make. I hear various versions of this but my understanding is the discussions the FA had with organisations like Amnesty is that they feel there would be more change if we go and these things are highlighted.
Englands manager knows he cannot please everybody. Whatever we do were going to be criticised, he said. But were going to do our best. Theres power in us being able to do something  and maybe even with other European nations. Conversations are going on all the time.
Henderson is at the heart of many such chats with teammates and international counterparts. As a senior player I do take a lot of responsibility and Ill speak to as many lads as I can, as will other senior members of the team, and come up with something we all thinks right, he said. And, as the gaffer said, theres the possibility of doing something with other European countries.
Whatever we decide to do will be criticised and will never be enough but we do it to try and make a difference in the world. I think everybody knows we stand for no discrimination. Footballs for everyone."

The Adelaide United player, who became the worlds only current openly gay top-flight professional footballer when he came out last month, told the Guardian at the time he would be scared to play in the Gulf state.
Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable by a penalties ranging from flogging to imprisonment and execution, but tournament organiser Nasser Al Khater assured gay fans they could feel safe there, as long as they act conservatively.
We welcome him [Cavallo] here in the state of Qatar, we welcome him to come and see, even prior to the World Cup, Al Khater told CNN. Nobody feels threatened here, nobody feels unsafe here.
I think, unfortunately, maybe hes getting this perception because of reading a lot of these accusations or reading a lot of these news stories that shine a negative light. Qatar is like any other society in this world. Everyone is welcome.
Listen, public display of affection is frowned upon, and that goes across the board  across the board. Qatar is a modest country. Thats all that needs to be respected. Other than that, everyone is free to live their life.
They [gay people] will be coming to Qatar as fans of a football tournament. They can do whatever any other human being would do. What Im saying is Qatar, from a public-display-of-affection factor, is conservative.
Homosexuality is potentially punishable by the death penalty for Muslims in the country under sharia law, although human rights reports have said there is no evidence any gay people have been executed for the offence.
Same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not recognised by the Qatari government and campaigning for LGBTQI+ rights in the country is outlawed. Al Khater accepted the World Cup could be used as a platform for protests to be made against Qatar but said that was not a concern for organisers.
All scenarios are open and all scenarios are on the table, he said. Are we worried about it? No, I wouldnt say were worried about it.
A danger index compiled in 2019 to guide LGBT travellers rated Qatar as the second most dangerous place to travel for queer people, but Al Khater claimed the negative perception of Qatar from outside the country was unfair.
Over the past few years, its probably gotten a little bit worse, he said. And no matter how much the state of Qatar puts forward, in terms of really accelerating progress, thats never captured, and thats never reflected and thats not ever something thats communicated.
Qatar, which will host the global showpiece event starting in November next year, has been criticised for its human rights record in the buildup to the tournament, including its treatment of migrant workers.
Cavallo, 21, received a wave of support from football fans and current and former players last month after opening up about his sexuality in a video posted to his club Adelaide Uniteds social media feeds. He told the Guardians Today in Focus podcast that the announcement had followed six anguished years of trying to hide his sexual identity from everyone he knew.
I read something along the lines of that [they] give the death penalty for gay people in Qatar, so its something Im very scared [of] and wouldnt really want to go to Qatar for that, he said.
And that saddens me. At the end of the day the World Cup is in Qatar and one of the greatest achievements as a professional footballer is to play for your country, and to know that this is in a country that doesnt support gay people and puts us at risk of our own life, that does scare me and makes me re-evaluate  is my life more important than doing something really good in my career?"

Mohamed Aboutrika, one of the stations best-known pundits, sparked fury after urging Muslim players to boycott the Premier Leagues Rainbow Laces campaign, which is designed to support the LGBTQ+ community, and saying that homosexuality is not compatible with Islam. The 43-year-old added that Muslim people have a role to play in eliminating homosexuality and described it as a dangerous ideology that is becoming nasty.
Aboutrikas comments were made live on beIN, which broadcasts live Premier League football in the Middle East and north Africa, less than a year before Qatar is due to host the World Cup. The country has been criticised by human rights groups for its treatment of the LGBTQ+ community.
Kick It Out, footballs anti-discrimination charity, criticised Aboutrika and hit out at beIN for allowing hate speech on its network.
Kick It Out condemns the incredibly homophobic comments of Mohamed Aboutrika, and our support and solidarity goes out to any members of the LGBTQ+ community that have been affected by them, Chris Paouros, a Kick It Out trustee, told the Guardian.
We are extremely disappointed and very concerned that beIN Sports decided it was appropriate to broadcast such hate speech in full on their network, and urge them to issue an apology to the LGBTQ+ community for doing so. As a Qatari broadcaster, beINs willingness to amplify homophobia in this way brings further into focus the safety of LGBTQ+ fans and players who may travel to Qatar for the World Cup, not to mention the freedoms of LGBTQ+ Qataris.
These are focuses of Kick It Outs newly formed Qatar 2022 Working Group, which alongside the likes of Stonewall, Football V Homophobia and Inside Inclusion will hope to drive inclusion and security for fans at next years tournament, as well as creating a lasting impact for the rights LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, and on the decision-making process for future tournaments.
Fare, an anti-discrimination network in football, questioned why Aboutrikas comments were not challenged during the programme. So disappointing to see Egyptian legend Mohamed Aboutrika dismissing the Premier Leagues Rainbow Laces campaign and using theological positions to do so, the organisation tweeted. No challenge from beIN Sports. He was given space to deny the rights and existence of a community.
It is understood beIn has reprimanded and sanctioned Abourtika for expressing views that it feels run contrary to its standpoint but has no plans to sack him. The broadcaster showed the Rainbow Laces campaign across the Arab world last weekend and will continue to do so across all its markets. A spokesperson said: As a global media group we represent, champion and support people, causes and interests of every single background, language and cultural heritage across 43 hugely diverse countries, as we show every day.
The Rainbow Laces campaign is designed to promote equality and diversity by showing support for all LGBT+ people in football and beyond, according to the leagues website. Players back the initiative by wearing rainbow-coloured laces.
The Premier League has contacted beIN about Aboutrikas comments. A spokesperson for the league said: We wholeheartedly disagree with the pundits views. The Premier League and its clubs are committed to supporting LGBTQ+ inclusion and making clear football is for everyone.
The chief executive of Qatar 2022 said on Tuesday that members of the LGBTQ+ community would be welcome at the World Cup. Everyone is welcome, Nasser al-Khater told CNN. Listen, public display of affection is frowned upon, and that goes across the board  across the board. Qatar is a modest country. Thats all that needs to be respected. Other than that, everyone is free to live their life."

Josh Cavallo, 21, who plays for Adelaide United in Australias A-League, received a wave of support from football fans and current and former players last month after opening up about his sexuality in a video posted to the clubs social media feeds.
Cavallo told the Guardians Today in Focus podcast on Monday that the announcement had followed six anguished years of trying to hide his sexual identity from everyone he knew. I didnt just hide it from my teammates, I hid it from my family, he said. I hid it from my friends, I hid it from everyone I hang around so it was only when I was by myself that I could genuinely relax and not worry and not stress.
The announcement made Cavallo the only out gay player in mens professional football, his isolation stark in a sport whose administrators have launched high-profile public campaigns in recent years embracing LGBT fans and culture.
Yet only a handful of male players have ever come out, in contrast to the womens game, which has easily blown past the same barrier: more than 40 lesbian or bisexual players took part in the 2019 womens World Cup in France, according to Fifa.
Critics have raised the fact that Fifa continues to award World Cups to countries such as Russia  where homophobia has been called a state?sponsored project  and Qatar, where same-sex acts are illegal, as evidence of the governing bodys patchy commitment to inclusion.
Asked if holding the tournament in a country with strict penalties for homosexuality sent the wrong message to gay footballers and fans, Cavallo, who has played for Australias under-20s international side, told the Guardians daily news podcast that he would be afraid for his safety if asked to participate in the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
I read something along the lines of that [they] give the death penalty for gay people in Qatar, so its something Im very scared [of] and wouldnt really want to go to Qatar for that, he said.
And that saddens me. At the end of the day the World Cup is in Qatar and one of the greatest achievements as a professional footballer is to play for your country, and to know that this is in a country that doesnt support gay people and puts us at risk of our own life, that does scare me and makes me re-evaluate  is my life more important than doing something really good in my career?
Homosexual acts are banned under several Qatari laws with penalties ranging from at least a year to a decade in prison. A danger index compiled in 2019 to guide LGBT travellers rated Qatar as the second most dangerous place to travel for queer people.
Muslims in the country can be subject to Sharia law that bans any sexual activity outside marriage with punishments ranging up to the death penalty, meaning homosexual acts can technically result in execution, though several human rights reports have said there is no evidence any gay people have been executed for the offence.
Cavallo said he had been contacted by several other professional footballers who were still in the closet and seeking his advice on coming out. There are people who have reached out to me in confidentiality and said: Im struggling with the same thing Josh, and theyre professional footballers too. And look, its something you cant rush. [I say] you want to be yourself, and at the end of the day I wasnt happy and now look at me, Im honestly on top of the world.
They like the sound of that and they say: Josh, I havent experienced that before and I want to, and I say: Its in your hands, its your journey and theres a light at the end of the tunnel. I didnt think there was but there definitely is.
Along with the appalling conditions for migrant workers building the infrastructure for the tournament, the prospect of gay fans or players being arrested in Qatar has dogged Fifa since the emirate was announced as host of the tournament in 2010. The organisations then president, Sepp Blatter, fuelled the controversy the same year when he was asked if he had any advice for gay people who wanted to travel to the Gulf state for the competition.
I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities, Blatter replied, grinning. He later apologised and said nobody would be prevented from attending a match on the basis of their sexuality.
Qatars royal leaders view the World Cup as a chance to spur the development of infrastructure such as stadiums, hotels and a metro network in the capital, Doha, as well as to attract tourists and build business and cultural links with the world. But they walk a fine line between accommodating what are now mainstream attitudes towards gay people in much of the world and the countrys own conservative religious values.
As the tournament has approached, Qatari officials have sought to reassure LGBT fans that they will be welcome in the country and can express themselves  within limits. Flying rainbow flags inside stadiums, for example, will be permitted. The tournament chief executive, Nasser al-Khater, said in 2019: I would like to assure any fan, of any gender, [sexual] orientation, religion, race to rest assured that Qatar is one of the most safe countries in the world  and theyll all be welcome here.
Pressed at the time over how Qataris would react to a gay couple holding hands, Khater said they would be treated the same as a heterosexual couple. A public display of affection is frowned upon. Its not part of our culture. But that goes across the board to everybody."

Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, while Russias president, Vladimir Putin, said gay people at the countrys Winter Olympics in 2014 should leave children alone.
Rogers made it clear he thought travelling to Russia or Qatar was a risk for gay fans and players. I would never pressure anyone into speaking about the issue but it is absolutely insane, he told Sky Sports. If you look at the next few World Cups, they are in places where, if I were to go, I would possibly be imprisoned or beat up ... It is pretty ridiculous.
Rogers added he thought footballs governing body should ensure gay players did not feel under threat. There is going to be number of gay fans that will go to watch the sport. Of course there is going to be another gay footballer there, Rogers said I think it is an issue that needs to be spoken about and discussed with Fifa because every player should feel safe when they go to a World Cup.
Fifas president, Sepp Blatter, was forced to apologise in 2010 after he said gay fans should refrain from sex if they attended the Qatar World Cup.
Rogers also denied that he returned to the US, where he plays for LA Galaxy, because he felt uncomfortable pursuing his career in Britain after coming out.
The support from my team-mates, guys that I heard things from who were very homophobic, they were the same guys that called me or sent me letters, Rogers, who played for Leeds United, said. There was that and then fans that reacted to the story in a very positive way made me believe that I needed to find courage to go back into the sport.
The Leeds fans have been very supportive as has the club and all of my team-mates here and in Holland and guys that I played with in the national team. It was more for me to go back to LA and be around my family and just be in an environment that I was comfortable with.
Rogers won the MLS Cup with LA Galaxy last season."
