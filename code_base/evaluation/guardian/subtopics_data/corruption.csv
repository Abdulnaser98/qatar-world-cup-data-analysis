Claridges for late-night business negotiations, helped engineer the downfall of the Libyan despot Muammar Gaddafi and orchestrated his tiny desert countrys successful bid to host the World Cup.
But until this year, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, Qatars former prime minister turned billionaire investor, might have escaped many peoples notice.
In June 2022, it was claimed that the Prince of Wales, now King Charles III, had accepted 3m in bags full of cash between 2011 and 2015  donations to his charity, from the man known variously as HBJ and the man who bought London.
The report, by the Sunday Times, threw a spotlight on a 63-year-old whose remarkable network of political and business connections is evidence of guile and staying power amid political turmoil.
He not only survived the 1995 bloodless coup against the regime he had served but remained at the heart of Qatari domestic and foreign policy, as the tiny emirate  whose citizen population is akin to that of Coventry  thrust itself on to the world stage.
His links to the UK go back decades and have not been without controversy. Thani was foreign minister in 1996, when Qatar signed a £500m arms contract with the British defence company BAE Systems. It later emerged that the deal involved the transfer of £7m into two Jersey trusts that he owned.
When the Jersey authorities launched an investigation into the payments, according to reports by the Observer, the British government warned them to back off or risk harming UK-Qatari relations.
Thani ended up paying the Jersey authorities £6m voluntarily, without admitting any wrongdoing. Blairs government denied reports that it put pressure on Jersey officials to drop the case.
Blair and Thani would go on to develop a close working relationship. Between 2004 and 2009, a period during which Thani graduated from foreign minister to prime minister, Qatars Al Udeid airbase became a staging post for US and UK military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
After Blair was succeeded by Gordon Brown in 2007, Thani would play a critical role in British financial stability too. Qatar invested in Barclays during the financial crisis in 2008, when Thani was prime minister, sparing the government the expense of bailing out the bank, as it had to with Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Halifax Bank of Scotland. Thanis personal investment vehicle, Challenger, took a stake in the bank too.
Three former Barclays executives were later accused of devising fraudulent advisory services agreements to disguise payments worth £322m to Qatar in exchange for the investment. They were found not guilty in February 2020 and there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Thani or Qatar. Barclays is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal.
With the globally influential Thani at the helm, the emirate became a pivotal player in political upheaval in the Gulf.
Qatar backed efforts to depose Gaddafi and supported the Arab spring uprisings, including through the state-owned news channel Al Jazeera.
Thani also allegedly conceded that under his premiership Qatar maybe financed the al- Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, without his knowledge.
Before leaving office, he was reunited with Blair in 2012, when a weary group of bankers and executives reached an impasse over the proposed £50bn merger of the mining firms Glencore and Xstrata.
The former British PM was called to late-night talks at Claridges hotel in Mayfair to help broker a deal with Thani, who controlled Qatars stake in Xstrata and was demanding improved terms on the deal.
Blair broke the deadlock and reportedly walked away with an advisory fee of up to $1m from the negotiating parties for a few hours work.
The incident epitomised what one person who has done business with Thani described as a relentless will to win, deploying his unrivalled connections to achieve his goals.
It also showed that he could pull strings in the highest places to leverage his countrys vast gas riches.

Not only did he preside over Qatars controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup, but he masterminded the purchase of prestige assets such as Harrods, the Shard and stakes in blue-chip companies such as the London Stock Exchange and the British Airways owner IAG.
Although he stepped down in 2013, his personal business dealings have run in parallel with those of the Qatari state. He has amassed a valuable portfolio of London property and hotels  useful for a man who reportedly has two wives and 15 children. The network of British business interests is run from 67 Brook Street, a Mayfair address that was once home to the Bee Gees.
The flagship of his portfolio is the Maybourne Hotel Group, including Claridges and the Connaught, which he owns in partnership with the former emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, his friend and ally. In 2021, he also bought a £200m stake in Richard Carings Caprice Holdings, which includes the Ivy and Sexy Fish restaurants, and the private members club Annabels.
His London residential property includes Forbes House, a mansion he is said to be developing into the capitals first £300m home and a triplex apartment at the One Hyde Park development that he financed in partnership with the Candy brothers. Both are owned via offshore companies, Land Registry records suggest.
His interests outside the UK include a stake in Deutsche Bank and extensive business interests in Qatar. Khalifa famously said that while he ran Qatar, Thani owned it.
At times, it has been unclear whether Thani is a businessman, a diplomat, or a mixture of the two.
In 2014, he bought an 80% stake in Heritage Oil, despite being listed as a counsellor at the Qatari embassy.
In theory, diplomats are prohibited from commercial dealings for personal profit but his lawyers argued the purchase did not constitute ongoing trade activity.
Two years later, the UK high court ruled he could not be sued in London over claims that agents acting on his behalf falsely imprisoned and tortured a British citizen who claimed that his land, in Qatar, had been wrongfully seized. Thani invoked diplomatic immunity but also denied the claims. Mr al-Attiyas extremely serious allegations are, without exception, a combination of distortion, exaggeration and wholesale fabrication, his lawyers said.
According to the Panama Papers leak of offshore secrets, Thani used a shell company to the 133-metre Al Mirqab yacht in 2002. The vessel, worth $300m, reportedly has a helicopter landing pad, Jacuzzi, cinema, gym and spa.
In May 2015, he bought Picassos Les Femmes dAlger (Version O) for $179.4m including fees, then a record price for a painting at auction.
The Guardian has approached him for comment."

The indictment, the latest in the long-running US prosecution of football officials for alleged corruption, accuses Nicolás Leoz, the Paraguayan then president of Conmebol, South American footballs governing body, and the former Brazil federation president Ricardo Teixeira of being paid bribes to vote for Qatar at the decisive Fifa executive committee (exco) meeting in December 2010. A third then very senior member of the exco under the former president Sepp Blatter, who is not named but is identifiable as Julio Grondona, the then president of Argentinas FA, is also accused of being paid to vote for Qatar, but Grondona, who died in 2014, was never criminally charged.
The indictment is also explosive for accusing the Russian authorities, for the first time, of paying bribes for votes in favour of their successful bid to host the 2018 World Cup, which was decided at the same fateful Fifa exco meeting. The document alleges in some detail that Jack Warner, then the long-serving president of the confederation for North and Central American and Caribbean football (Concacaf), was promised and received bribe payments totalling $5m to cast his vote for Russia.
Another then member of the Fifa exco, the former president of the Guatemala FA Rafael Salguero, is accused of being promised a $1m bribe to vote for Russia. Salguero pleaded guilty to multiple corruption charges in the US in 2016, and admitted then that he was offered a bribe to vote for a certain 2018 World Cup host, but the name of the country was redacted from his plea document and he said he never received the money. Warner, facing multiple corruption charges, has denied any wrongdoing and for years has been contesting extradition from his home island of Trinidad.
Alexei Sorokin, the chief executive of Russias 2018 World Cup, denied the allegations, as did Qatars supreme committee overseeing the major stadium construction and preparations to host the tournament due to start in November 2022. Led by the ruling Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Qatar remains determined to host the World Cup.
In a statement, the supreme committee said it would fight any accusation that it did not win the votes legitimately. Despite years of false claims, evidence has never been produced to demonstrate that Qatar won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup 2022 unethically or by means that contravened Fifas strict bidding rules, the statement said.
The supreme committee maintains that it strictly adhered to all rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process and any claim to the contrary is baseless and will be fiercely contested.
Under Gianni Infantino, voted president after Blatter was banned from football in December 2015 for breaches of Fifas ethics code, footballs world governing body has condemned all proven previous corruption and is itself pursuing a compensation claim against its accused former officials.
Fifa, pointing out that it had been accorded victim status in the US criminal proceedings, said in a statement that it supports all investigations into alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing regarding either domestic or international football competitions, and will continue to provide full cooperation to law enforcement officials investigating such matters.
Should any acts of criminal wrongdoing by football officials be established, the individuals in question should be subject to penal sanctions.
Senior officials say that Fifa will genuinely take the allegations against the organisations old guard very seriously and consider all the implications  but it can be inferred now that moving the tournament from Qatar is highly improbable. Two of those accused of receiving bribes, Leoz and Grondona, have died, so cannot be found guilty. Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the Fifa president before Blatter, João Havelange, has not been extradited to face any of the multiple corruption charges levelled against him by the Department of Justice, so any trial must be considered unlikely.
The indictment is also light on detail in relation to the alleged bribes for Qatar, an allegation first made in a Brooklyn court in late 2017 during the corruption trial of three other former South American football officials. Alejandro Burzaco, a TV executive who had pleaded guilty to paying bribes, testified that Grondona had once told him that he was owed $1m by Teixeira because he had voted for Qatar. Grondona also said, according to Burzaco, that it was not a private thing that he, Teixeira and Leoz, who was also accused of prodigious corruption by the US authorities, were voting for Qatar.
Two and a half years on, the indictment alleges nothing more than: The defendant Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolás Leoz and [Grondona, described as Co-Conspirator #1], were offered and received bribe payments in exchange for their votes in favour of Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
Even if this case were to reach trial, following an unpredictable delay in the court system owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, and even if Teixeira were found guilty  he has always denied corruption allegations  it would have to be shown that any bribes came from the official Qatar bid and were decisive in sending the tournament to Qatar. Qatar were more than three votes ahead in all four rounds of voting for the 2022 host country.
For more than nine years since, Qatar has spent billions building seven stadiums, reconfiguring another and constructing vast infrastructure to host the World Cup. Exceptionally solid, proven reasons would be needed, in good time, if the tournament were to be moved, and clearly the supreme committee denies any suggestion that it should."

An indictment unsealed on Monday in the US District Court in Brooklyn says Nicolás Leoz, the Paraguayan then president of the South American governing body, Conmebol, and the former Brazil federation president Ricardo Teixeira received bribes to vote for Qatar at the 2010 Fifa executive committee meeting.
Jack Warner, the former president of Concacaf, the governing body for North and Central America, is said to have received $5m in bribes to vote for Russia to host in 2018. The money allegedly came from 10 different shell companies, including entities in Anguilla, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.
The Guatemala federation president, Rafael Salguero, was also promised a $1m bribe to vote for Russia, according to the indictment. Leoz, who died last August, avoided extradition, as have Warner, from Trinidad & Tobago, and Teixeira. Salguero pleaded guilty in 2018 to two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, and one count each of racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.
Alejandro Burzaco, the Argentinian former head of the marketing company Torneos y Competencias, testified in 2017 that all three South Americans on the Fifa executive committee took million-dollar bribes to support Qatar, which beat the US in the final vote.
In a statement, William F Sweeney Jr., assistant director in charge of the FBIs New York field office, said: The profiteering and bribery in international soccer have been deep-seated and commonly known practices for decades.
He added: The defendants and their co-conspirators corrupted the governance and business of international soccer with bribes and kickbacks, and engaged in criminal fraudulent schemes that caused significant harm to the sport of soccer.
Since the first indictments were announced in May 2015, there have been 26 publicly announced guilty pleas, many from former soccer officials, including the American general secretary of Concacaf, Chuck Blazer. The Conmebol president, Juan Ángel Napout of Paraguay, and Brazil federation president José Maria Marin were convicted following trials.
The US Department of Justice also announced that two former 21st Century Fox executives, Hernan Lopez and Carlos Martinez, have been charged with making payments to Conmebol officials in order to obtain broadcast rights bidding information. Fox gained the broadcast rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in 2011, with Fifa later awarded Fox rights for 2026 without competitive bidding.
Lopez and Martinez are also accused of joining with a Uruguayan company, Full Play Group SA, to pay million of dollars in bribes to Conmebol executives in exchange for rights to the Copa Libertadores, South Americas annual club championship.
Gerard Romy, the Spanish former CEO of Imagina Media Audiovisual, is accused with joining his alleged co-conspirators to pay a $3m bribe to Jeffrey Webb, the former president of Concacaf, for media and marketing rights to home World Cup qualifiers in the Caribbean. Webb, from the Cayman Islands, pleaded guilty in November 2015 to several counts and awaits sentencing."

The US Department of Justice announced on Monday that Hernan Lopez, the former chief executive of Fox International Channels and Carlos Martinez, the former president of Fox Latin America, have been charged with wire fraud and money-laundering offenses, marking another series of indictments in the US governments sprawling investigation of corruption in world football.
The indictment alleges that Lopez and Martinez relied on loyalty secured through the payment of bribes to South American football officials in order to advance the business interest of Fox and obtain confidential bidding information to win US broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup.
21st Century Fox declined to comment on the indictments. The company was sold by Murdoch to Disney for $71bn in March 2019, years after the alleged bribery scheme is alleged to have occurred.
The pair of former executives are also accused of involvement in the payment of annual bribes to South American football federation (Conmebol) officials to secure broadcast rights to the Copa Libertadores, South Americas biggest club competition.
Over 40 people and entities have been charged as part of the US governments ongoing investigation of bribery in world football. The investigation was dramatically announced at a 2015 dawn raid in Zurich on the eve of a congress of the world footballs governing body, Fifa.
Two Conmebol officials, involved in the alleged scheme with Lopez and Martinez, the former heads of football in Brazil and Paraguay, were found guilty of accepting millions in bribes during a 2017 trial. Prosecutors have secured at least 23 guilty pleas as part of the investigation.
Lopez and Martinez were the subject of a Guardian investigation in 2017, which revealed that the US justice department believed the two had provided agreement and support for bribes to football officials. The US governments star witness during the 2017 trial, the former marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco, who has pleaded guilty to corruption charges, also implicated the pair in the scheme during evidence.
Lopez and Martinez are scheduled for arraignment in federal court in Brooklyn on 9 April and could face up to 20 years in prison.
The charges unsealed today reflect this offices ongoing commitment to rooting out corruption at the highest levels of international soccer and at the businesses engaged in promoting and broadcasting the sport, said Richard P Donoghue, the United States attorney for the eastern district of New York.
On Monday, lawyers for the former Fox executives said both planned to fight the charges in court.
Its shocking that the government would bring such a thin case. The indictment contains nothing more than single paragraph about Mr Lopez that alleges nothing remotely improper. Mr Lopez cant wait to defend himself at trial, said Matthew Umhofer, representing Lopez.
We are certain a jury will swiftly exonerate Carlos, as these charges are nothing more than stale fiction, said Steven McCool, representing Martinez.
The new indictments also laid out charges against the former CEO of Spanish media company Imagina, Gerard Romy and Uruguayan media company Full Play Group. They also include allegations against four unnamed co-conspirators who occupied various levels of seniority at Fifa and South American football administrations."

The allegations were first made in a book, Whatever It Takes  the Inside Story of the Fifa Way, by a whistleblower from inside Australias failed 2022 bid, Bonita Mersiades, in January 2018. However, the Sunday Times said it had also seen documents showing executives from al-Jazeera had signed a TV contract that included an unprecedented success fee of $100m  which would be paid to Fifa only if Qatar won the World Cup ballot in 2010.
The documents allegedly state : In the event that the 2022 competition is awarded to the state of Qatar, al-Jazeera shall, in addition to the  rights fee, pay to Fifa into the designated account the monetary amount of $100m.
Damian Collins, the chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said Fifa should freeze the payments from al-Jazeera and launch an investigation into the apparent contract that appears to be in clear breach of the rules.
The Sunday Times said it also had seen a copy of a second secret television rights contract for a further $480m that was offered by Qatar three years later  which it said was now part of a bribery inquiry by Swiss police.
The allegations are likely to lead to further suspicion as to whether Qatar played fair when it bid to host the World Cup.
Mersiadess book claims that in the months before the vote in December 2010 Fifa executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022. However, al-Jazeera  which is now beIN Sports  agreed the secret deal to pay $100m if Qatar won the vote.
The 2022 Fifa World Cup will take place 21 November-18 December 2022. It is the 22nd time the tournament has been staged, and the first time that the football World Cup has been held outside its traditional slot of June and July. Qatar is the smallest nation ever to host the World Cup.
The tournament will feature 32 teams. Qatar qualify automatically as hosts, and will be playing in their debut World Cup finals. Qualification for the tournament concludes in March 2022, and the draw is due to take place in April 2022.
While the match schedule is yet to be confirmed, the World Cup is expected to take place in eight stadiums in five cities: Doha, Lusail, Al Khor, Al Rayyan and Al Wakrah.
Awarding the tournament to Qatar has been mired in controversy. Qatars bid won despite the countrys climate being too hot to host the tournament at the time specified in the bidding manual. Of the 22 people who voted in awarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in December 2010, several including Sepp Blatter, Jack Warner, Ricardo Teixeira, Chuck Blazer, Rafael Salguero and Michel Platini have either been banned from football or indicted on corruption charges.
Additionally there have been concerns over human rights abuses of construction workers building the new stadiums needed for the bid, and campaigners have criticised hosting the World Cup in a country where LGBT relationships are banned.
The bonus was agreed, the book alleges, with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of Fifa at the time but later banned for nine years from football for corruption.
In an email response to questions from the Sunday Times on Friday, Fifa wrote that allegations linked to the Fifa World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by Fifa, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com.
Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. Fifa is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities.
When asked about the payment by the Mail on Sunday in January, a beIN Sports spokesperson characterised the bonus as production contributions which were standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders.
There is clearly a significant uplift in interest and additional revenues to a broadcaster and significant additional local production costs to a rights holder when a major sports event is awarded in a broadcasters domestic market, the spokesperson added. The relevant media agreements were stand alone from any bid, and were in no way intended to influence the outcome of the vote."

Damian Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said on Sunday that Fifa should address allegations that the Gulf state hired a PR agency and former CIA operatives to disseminate fake propaganda about its main competitors, the USA and Australia, more seriously than it handled earlier corruption allegations.
The claims came from an anonymous whistleblower, who alleged to the Sunday Times that a smear campaign had been orchestrated on behalf of Qatars bid committee, which included paying a professor $9,000 (£6,900) to write a damning report on the economic cost of a US World Cup, recruiting journalists and bloggers to promote negative stories in the US, Australian and international media, and organising grassroots protests at rugby matches in Australia, to give Fifa the impression of a lack of support for bids in their home countries.
The leaked documents purport to show that a group of American PE teachers had been recruited to ask congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds the money would be better spent on high school sports.
Fifas rules of conduct for the bidding process state that bidders should not make any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association..
Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup in the winter to avoid games being played in summer temperatures, which means domestic football schedules in Europe and elsewhere will be interrupted.
Fifa has already investigated corruption allegations involving the Qatar bid, but did not find any evidence that it had bought votes so the tournament is set to go ahead as planned. It will be the first time the event has been hosted in the Middle East, even though Qatar has no history of playing top-class football.
The Sunday Times published an email, purportedly from Michael Holtzman, the president of the communications and PR company BLJ in New York, who was working for Qatar 2022, to Ahmad Nimeh, an adviser on Qatars bid team. Dated 17 May 2010 and under the subject line strategy, it says: For the past 4 months, we have undertaken an extensive campaign to undermine the 2018/2022 candidacies of competitor countries, particularly Australia and the US.
According to the newspaper, Holtzman said this included: recruiting journalists, bloggers and high-profile figures in each market to raise questions and promote negative aspects of their respective bids in the media. Dozens of articles have appeared in US, Australian and international media that have embarrassed or undermined these bids and put bid leadership on [the] defensive ... Developing reports, studies and legislation that provide embarrassing details or undermine central aspects of each bid ... We have delivered several deeply revealing intelligence reports on individual targets that have been used internally by the bid.
Holtzman said: We have a group of pro-rugby students in Melbourne, Australia, who will start appearing at rugby matches with signs Hands off our rugby! No to World Cup! in June.
Collins told Sky News on Sunday: Ive met the whistleblower myself and seen the evidence that hes brought forward. I think these are serious matters and there needs to be a proper independent investigation of them.
He said there had been a significant loss of confidence in Fifa as a result of corruption allegations and that the latest claims represented an opportunity to demonstrate that Fifa takes these issues much more seriously than it has done.
Lord Triesman, Englands bid chairman in 2010 when the country campaigned to host the 2018 finals and a former chairman of the Football Association, urged Fifa to look at the evidence thoroughly, and said Qatar should not be allowed to host the World Cup if the country is shown to have broken Fifa rules.
Fifa said: Concerning the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process, a thorough investigation was conducted by Michael Garcia and his conclusions are available in the report. Generally speaking, complaints regarding potential breaches of the Fifa code of ethics may be filed via Fifas confidential reporting mechanism.
Qatars organising committee said it rejected the allegations. We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia, it said in a statement. We have strictly adhered to all Fifas rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process.
BLJ has been approached for comment."

Following his handling of the Eni Aluko racism scandal and subsequent bravura performance before a government select committee tasked with getting to the bottom of it, December saw reports that Clarke had already visited two thirds of Uefa territories as part of a global outreach programme aimed at disabusing his counterparts in assorted national football associations of the notion that the FA is arrogant.
Illegal merchandisers and bootleggers were already understood to be printing up souvenir T-shirts to knock out on the Asian and African legs of a world tour that last week rocked up in Qatar, where Clarke was shown around Dohas Khalifa International Stadium.
While details from official reports on Clarkes visit to the gulf state are sketchy in places, we can only assume he was also cajoled by his host into staging a meet?and?greet in the labour camps housing the migrant workers who built the 40,000-capacity arena and its surrounding Aspire Zone.
Whether or not he was shown the exact spot from which the British construction worker Zac Cox plunged to his death 13 months ago while working on the stadium remains unclear, although considering there has still been no official account from the countrys authorities regarding the death, we are left to speculate that this delicate subject may not have been raised.
Veronica Hamilton-Deeley, the British coroner who will lead the inquest into Coxs death, has certainly found authorities in Doha to be decidedly coy when it comes to talking about the accident that claimed the 40-year-olds life. It has proved almost impossible to get information, she said in November. Considering Qatari public health officials have failed to respond to requests for information about the causes of deaths of an estimated 2,000 or more migrant construction workers since 2012, one imagines Hamilton-Deeley is near the back of a very long queue.
In a report published in 2016, Amnesty International revealed that those who laboured on the renovation of the stadium had been subjected to a wide range of exploitative practices including high recruitment fees for which many took out loans; false promises about the pay and type of work on offer; passport confiscation; dirty and cramped accommodation; and threats for complaining about their conditions. On the plus side, at least it was finished on time, which is more than can be said for the FAs equivalent vanity project at Wembley.
There the lack of similarities between the two stadiums does not end. Unlike Wembley, the Khalifa Stadium will get to host World Cup matches in the foreseeable future and cynics have suggested that as well as endeavouring to shed the FAs reputation for arrogance, the man who recently dismissed accusations of institutional racism against the FA as fluff is brown-nosing his way around the world in the hope of winning friends and influencing people ahead of an English bid for Fifas 2030 global football jamboree.
We have been here before. In 2010, eight days before the vote to see where the 2018 World Cup would be played, the FA agreed to play Thailand in a friendly in order to win their support for Englands doomed bid. The offer was subsequently rescinded and later described as a form of bribery by the bid teams own leader, Geoff Thompson. While there is no suggestion of any impropriety on Clarkes part, it has not gone unnoticed that after signing the vaguely titled memorandum of understanding with the Qatar FA in Doha, the FA announced it would look at the possibility of organising friendly matches across the different age groups.
While it is far too early to suggest that history is starting to repeat itself, it certainly seems to be humming the opening bars of a spookily similar tune. Quite apart from the dubious morality of Clarkes latest jolly, putting politics before principles has backfired spectacularly on the FA before.
A graduate of law from Sheffield University, who visited his alma mater to pick up his degree certificate while being entertained by Clarke on a visit to England last November, Hassan Al-Thawadi is the secretary general of Qatars preposterously titled Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy and was seen beaming alongside Clarke as they exchanged football shirts and pennants during a photo-op which served to publicise the English FAs tacit endorsement of a regime that considers homosexuality illegal.
Having wondered aloud last year why gay footballers seem strangely reticent to engage with me, Clarke showed no sign of a man who had figured out why as, without a hint of reticence, he handed over a pennant bearing the slogan The FA For All to his opposite number in a country that punishes gay folk with a spell in the Big House.
It seems that in FA circles, irony has flatlined and it wont take a frustrated British coroner struggling to ge-t answers from the powers that be in Doha to figure out the cause of death."

As part of the cooperation deal, the two countries have committed to exploring the possibility of arranging friendlies across age groups.
The FA is pleased to commit to this knowledge-sharing partnership with the Qatar Football Association, Clarke said.
We have a long history of collaboration with various national associations to share knowledge and experience to support the development of football.
For Qatar, developing the game across the country is a key objective as they approach the hosting of the Fifa World Cup in 2022.
Clarke also visited Khalifa International Stadium, which is the first ground to open that will be used for the World Cup.
Ajay Sharma, the British ambassador to Qatar, was also part of the touring party and he hopes the agreement will lead to further links between the two nations.

The claim was made by Santiago Peña, a former financial executive at the Argentinian marketing company Full Play, as part of testimony in the trial of three former South American football officials accused on multiple bribery counts. Peña is a star US government witness in the sprawling investigation into corruption at Fifa, the sports governing body. He has laid out detailed evidence that Full Play paid multimillion-dollar bribes to a group of football officials in exchange for the rights to regional competitions and World Cup qualifiers.
During testimony on Tuesday, Peña revealed that al-Khelaifi, referred to only by his first name and [the] head of soccer club  Paris Saint-Germain by defence attorneys, was in negotiations with the owners of Full Play, Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, to buy the company out. Both Hugo and Mariano Jinkis  father and son  have been indicted by US prosecutors on corruption charges, but remain in Argentina.
Peña said the deal was kept almost entirely confidential within Full Play and only he, the owners and one other finance executive, were aware of the negotiations. The former executive said that once Full Plays owners had been indicted in the US government investigation, unveiled after a dramatic raid on a hotel in Zurich in May 2015, the deal was abandoned.
After 27 May, logically, the potential transaction was ended, Peña told prosecutors during testimony on Monday. He added that he deleted emails relating to the negotiations shortly after the indictments were announced.
A spokesman for Qatar Sports Investments, the Qatari firm chaired by al-Khelaifi, confirmed to the Guardian that the company had examined acquiring a controlling shareholding in Full Play but decided against it after closer inspection.
On Tuesday Peña said the takeover would have seen the Qataris obtain 51% of the company, with an option of a further 19%, for $212m. Executives referred to the deal as the New York Project  a reference to the 212 area code in Manhattan and the sum being offered. They had been working on negotiations for more than one year, Peña said. He added that under the proposed arrangement Hugo and Mariano Jinkis would continue to operate the company after the proposed takeover occurred.
Peña, who worked at Full Play between 2009 and 2015, has implicated Hugo and Mariano Jinkis in a series of multimillion-dollar bribe payments. Key to his evidence has been the disclosure of a ledger the prosecution claims shows records of bribe payments made to a group of South American football officials on the regions governing body, Conmebol.
Peña said he used codewords, mostly car manufacturers names, to denote bribe payments made to each of the officials, including defendants Manuel Burga, the former head of the Peruvian football association and Juan Ángel Napout, the Paraguayan former president of Conmebol, who have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts relating to corruption.
Al-Khelaifi is seen as a leading figure in the Gulf states push into the international sports world including hosting the 2022 World Cup, and is also the chairman of prominent broadcaster beIN.
Last month he was accused by Swiss prosecutors of bribing the former Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke to purchase broadcast rights to World Cup tournaments."

being hosted by Russia and Qatar have been strengthened after Fifa dramatically published in full the investigation by the US prosecutor Michael Garcia into the 2010 voting process.
Long thought to contain explosive revelations after Garcia resigned in 2014 protesting that a summary published by his fellow ethics committee chairman, Hans-Joachim Eckert, misrepresented it. His 349-page main report contained some startling detail on the culture of entitlement at Fifa, but his main findings largely tallied with the thrust of Eckerts summary.
He did find evidence of serious alleged irregularities and recommended investigation and action against several senior members of Fifas executive committee, including the former German player and coach Franz Beckenbauer, but did not recommend that the vote be annulled.
Qatar were found to have employed tactics familiar now including the sponsorship of the Confederation of African Football conference in Angola and the famous 2010 lunch attended by the son of the countrys emir at the time with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and the then Uefa president Michel Platini, but not to have bought votes.
Russias bid to host the 2018 World Cup was found not to have fully reported all its contacts with the executive committee members, as required by the rules, but were otherwise explicitly cleared of offering any excessive gifts or undue influence.
The publication of the report will prompt some embarrassment within the English FA whose chairman in 2014, Greg Dyke, protested that the Eckert summary was a whitewash. The Garcia report, as reported by Eckerts summary, found that the England bid had sought to curry favour in breach of the rules with some executive committee members, in particular the notorious Trinidadian executive committee member, Jack Warner, who is now banned from football for life.
Garcia included much more detail on the finding revealed by Eckert that Englands 2018 bid had found work, at Tottenham Hotspur and at Wembley, at Warners request, for a young man he described as like his adopted son. The FA has never commented officially on the criticisms made of its conduct by Eckert.
The most striking difference between the summary Eckert published in November 2014 and the full Garcia report was in Garcias criticisms of Fifas then president Sepp Blatter, which were absent from Eckerts summary. Garcia found no case to answer that Blatter had breached any of Fifas ethics codes over the fraught and suspicion-laden process that led to Russia and Qatar claiming the next two World Cup finals tournaments.
However, Garcia said explicitly that holding a vote of Fifas then executive committee at the same time for two different bids was vulnerable to collusion. He also found that Blatter was much more indulgent and generous towards the executive committee members than the disapproving statements of wrongdoing he made in public  even suggesting in November 2010 that they should each be paid a bonus of $200,000, including two members, Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, who were suspended at the time. After praising Blatter for introducing reforms, Garcia wrote: As head of Fifa, however, President Blatter bears some responsibility for a flawed process that engendered deep public scepticism, and for presiding over an executive committee whose culture of entitlement contributed to many of the issues this report identified.
Garcia concluded: As the leader of Fifa, responsibility for these failings and for positive steps taken to reform the organisation resides with President Blatter.
The ethics committee, whose investigatory chamber was chaired by Cornel Borbély after Garcia resigned and whose adjudicatory chamber was still chaired by Eckert, banned Blatter and Platini from football for malpractice in December 2015. Gianni Infantino was elected to succeed Blatter as president in February 2016 and in a statement Fifa said the new chairs of the ethics committee had decided to publish the Garcia report, as Infantino had called for, because the German magazine Bild had a leaked copy it was planning to reveal in stages. Infantino, who has said the World Cups in Russia and Qatar will go ahead, is unlikely to find the tournaments too troubled by the long-awaited publication.
The bid mounted by the tiny Gulf state of Qatar to project itself globally by hosting the World Cup was lavish, promoted by the ruling emir and his son, and used the facilities of the countrys Aspire academy, but Garcia did not conclude that Fifa votes were bought. He accepted the position of the official Qatar 2022 bid, which it has repeatedly stated in public, that the disgraced Qatari football official Mohamed bin Hammam, who did make corrupt payments, was not connected to the bid itself. Garcia also concluded that a series of payments Bin Hammam made to officials of African football federations were not related to the Qatar 2022 bid, but more likely to his own bid to oppose Blatter in Fifas 2011 presidential election.
The 2018 bid by Russia, which Roman Abramovich supported, was explicitly cleared of wrongdoing in the report produced by Garcias deputy, Borbély. As Eckert had stated in his summary, Borbély accepted in his report that Russias official bid leased its computers, then returned them to their owner, who destroyed them.
The release of Borbélys report has revealed that the owner was the Konoplyov academy, a football foundation [which] appeared to have been linked with Mr Roman Abramovich. The Chelsea owner, who became a billionaire when he bought Russian state assets cheaply in corrupt auctions in the early 2000s, travelled with the 2018 delegation but was found not to have provided any financial help to the bid apart from the computers.
The revelations about Beckenbauer largely relate to the employment by the Australia 2022 bid team of his long term business associate and advisor, Fedor Radmann, with another Munich-based consultant, Andreas Abold. Garcia recommended that Beckenbauer, who was disciplined for failing cooperate, should be investigated further for evidence he violated substantive ethics provisions.
1) FA embarrassed Corrupt Trinidad & Tobago Fifa member Jack Warner asked Lord Triesman and David Dein to sort a job for Richard Sebro, the son of his banker. He was secured summer work at Tottenham and Wembley.
2) Teixeira corruption The 10-year-old daughter of Fifa member Ricardo Teixeira had $2m deposited into her savings account. The report claims the former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell made the payment, though it also states there is no evidence it was related to the Qatar bid.
3) Geoff Thompson Confirmation that Englands 2018 bid chairman agreed a vote-trading deal with South Koreas Chung Mong-joon on the eve of the vote in December 2010.
4) Lack of cooperation Only five of the 22 Fifa ExCo members who voted for 2018 and 2022 gave Garcia proper cooperation in his investigation. They are the only people who would have first-hand knowledge of bribes and corruption in relation to the bids.
5) Detail of Fifa largesse Sepp Blatter is described as presiding over a culture of expectation and entitlement. Ricardo Teixeiras four-night stay in Qatar in 2010 cost $5,490 a night for the hotel room and he charged $23,900 to it.

Other countries have until 11 August to express interest in hosting the World Cup and must meet a list of Fifas technical specifications by March 2018. The decision to select any bidders will take place on 13 June 2018.
Previously, the final decision had been scheduled for May 2020 under the four-stage bidding process announced by Fifa this time last year.
The United States, Mexico and Canada announced a joint bid for the 2026 tournament last month at a news conference in lower Manhattan. If the ambitious three-nation endeavor is successful, it would be the first time a World Cup was co-hosted by multiple countries since the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.
Under the proposal, the US will host 60 games, including every match from the quarter-finals onwards, with Mexico and Canada splitting the remaining 20 fixtures equally.
The United States last hosted the World Cup in 1994. That tournament was a 24-team, 52-match event that still holds the attendance record (with nearly 3.6 million spectators), despite a subsequent expansion of the format to 32 teams and 64 matches. Mexico previously hosted the tournament in 1970 and 1986, while Canada hosted the womens World Cup in 2015.
Challengers to the US-led proposal are scarce with Europe and Asia ineligible to bid after being awarded, respectively, the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Morocco and Algeria have reportedly mulled official bids for 2026 and could challenge the North American bid should either broker an adequate voting alliance. Europe has 55 members in the Congress, Africa 54, Asia 46, Concacaf 35, Oceania 11 and South America 10.
But North Americas preexisting infrastructure, anchored by a fleet of new NFL stadiums built over the past two decades that meet Fifa specifications, make the US-led bid the prohibitive favorite.
We have the luxury of being able to pick from stadiums and cities, the US Soccer president, Sunil Gulati, said last month. And given whats happened in the last World Cups and some of the Olympic Games, the thought of building sports facilities that dont have a long term use is not one thats particularly inviting for anyone.
So in all of our cases, we have stadiums that have exist for professional teams or other events. We think thats that huge advantage not just for us, but for Fifa or the IOC, that infrastructure thats in place or developed for the NFL or for Liga MX, is a far better solution than spending hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars on stadiums that dont have use beyond the tournament."

Zwanziger, who headed the DFB until 2012 and has been embroiled in a 2006 World Cup scandal, first made the comment last year to the public broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk, adding the decision for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup should be reviewed as corruption allegations hit the world governing body Fifa.
The Qatar Football Association filed a lawsuit over the comment claiming it showed collective disrespect and Zwanziger should be banned from repeating it.
But Düsseldorfs regional court ruled that while the comment was indeed offensive, Zwanziger was not obliged under German law to change his wording or be blocked from repeating it.
Those criticising public abuses do not have to use the mildest possible medium to highlight their points of view, the court said in a statement.
It has nothing to do with public defamation of the Qatar Football Association, as it was about the legality and checks regarding the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar that were at the forefront.
With respect to the sporting, financial and political importance of a football World Cup host, the purpose for the comment, which was about drawing attention to the critical working process and decision of Fifa, is set higher than the honour of the Qatar Football Association.
Zwanziger has said he was not referring to the Qatari people with his comment.
Fifa, where Zwanziger was an executive committee member, faced the biggest crisis in its history last year with several investigations leading to dozens of individuals being arrested on corruption charges.
Switzerlands prosecutor is investigating both Fifas decision to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar, a small, wealthy desert country with no real football tradition.
Several human rights groups have also accused Qatar of systematically abusing migrant workers rights.
Russia and Qatar have denied all wrongdoing.
A Frankfurt prosecutor is also formally investigating Zwanziger and other former football officials for suspected tax fraud in relation to a payment to Fifa ahead of to the 2006 World Cup in Germany.
Zwanziger has welcomed the investigation, saying: I dont have any worries in that matter. I know that I tell the truth and that I dont have to fear anything."

Harold Mayne-Nicholls of Chile repeatedly asked for personal favours related to the hosting and training of his relatives (a son, nephew and brother-in-law), Fifa ethics judges said in a statement on Thursday.
The bidder and institution were not identified, though it was previously reported Mayne-Nicholls approached the Aspire academy in Doha about unpaid work and intern positions. The youth academy was linked to Qatars successful 2022 World Cup hosting bid.
Mr Mayne-Nicholls did not act in Fifas interests and ignored his responsibility as a high-ranking Fifa official, someone who was expected to act with utmost neutrality and integrity, in order to pursue his own personal interests, the statement said.
The ethics judging chamber said Mayne-Nicholls broke several articles of Fifas ethics code, including offering or accepting gifts and conflicts of interest.
By giving Mayne-Nicholls written reasons for the verdict, he can now finally take his case to the Fifa appeals committee.
Mayne-Nicholls was considering standing in the Fifa presidential election when his ethics case was reported in 2014.
He was appointed by Fifa in 2010 to lead a six-member team evaluating the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidders. All nine candidates were visited between July and September 2010.
In the technical report, Mayne-Nicholls flagged the eventual winners Russia and Qatar as presenting the most risk to Fifa as potential host nations.
The Fifa executive committee largely ignored his report, plus a Fifa-commissioned analysis of the commercial prospects for each bidders World Cup project, in a December 2010 vote.
Mayne-Nicholls was voted out of office as president of the Chile FA soon after completing his task for Fifa."

Lawyers for Fawaz al-Attiya, a British citizen and former official spokesman of the emirate, claimed that Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, had taken up a position as a diplomat in London after leaving office to shield himself from claims that he was responsible for their clients kidnap and torture.
Attiya claims that Qatari agents acting on behalf of Thani, who is commonly known as HBJ, ordered his false imprisonment in Doha for 15 months beginning in 2009 and subjected him to conditions amounting to torture.
The claims are rejected by HBJ, whose lawyers say the extremely serious allegations are, without exception, a combination of distortion, exaggeration and wholesale fabrication.
At the high court, Thomas de la Mare QC, acting for Attiya, said that HBJ had invested billions in Barclays bank, a transaction for which the bank was now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, and that he was intimately involved in Qatars successful bid for the football World Cup in 2022.
The [Barclays] investments were subject to a high profile SFO investigation against Barclays bank which one would anticipate the defendant [HBJ] would be a highly significant witness if called, said de la Mare. Immunity was operating in a context  arising with Barclays and indeed the World Cup.
HBJ, who has a personal fortune of £8bn, stood down as Qatars prime minister and foreign minister in June 2013. He has appeared on the UKs Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) diplomatic list as a minister-counsellor serving in the London embassy and has remained on the diplomatic list.
Monica Carss-Frisk QC, who is acting for HBJ, said the FCO had confirmed that his appointment  which focused on economic relations  began on 6 November 2013. As a minister-counsellor, he would have legal immunity under the Vienna convention of 1961.
In court, de la Mare claimed that HBJ had in fact never taken up his position in the embassy. The lawyer described the appointment as a sham. [HBJ] had never been to the Foreign Office, never gone to the London embassy or attended the ambassadors reception and ate the Ferrero Rocher chocolates on offer.
Instead, he argued, that HBJ spent his time pursuing personal business deals  breaching the terms of the Vienna convention which forbids engaging in commercial activity for personal profit. Court papers claim that HBJ held beneficiary ownership of key London hotels and had purchased an oil company in London for £1bn while a diplomat.
There is no doubt that he was engaged in substantial commercial activity in the UK and when not here he was engaged in it elsewhere. He bought a stake in Deutsche Bank and bought Spanish department store El Corte Ingles, said de la Mare.
He added that HBJs Instagram account showed he spent much of his time when not doing deals on holidays in exotic locations such as Marrakech, Mumbai and the Maldives. The judge, Justice Blake, drew laughs in court by asking whether Instagram was a social media account.
However, Carss-Frisk said such claims were irrelevant as Qatar had freely appointed the billionaire as a diplomat and that this had been confirmed by the FCO, which had been made aware of claims of business activity. The Qatari ambassador and foreign minister and the foreign office all say he was appointed as a diplomat, she said.
She added it was wrong to suggest HBJ could not claim diplomatic immunity under the Vienna convention and argued that the court should speak with one voice with the government on such a matter of international relations.
She told the judge that if the court decided to remove HBJs immunity there might be many, many cases of spurious allegations by reference to Instagram over whether diplomats are exercising their diplomatic functions or not. It makes the whole thing unworkable.
Blake said that the issue he had to consider was whether the Foreign Office officials had taken an ultra vires step in claiming HBJ had enjoyed the privileges and immunities of a member of the diplomatic staff of a mission.
The judge reserved judgement and will make a ruling at a later date."

The US is working closely on the Fifa investigation with the Swiss authorities, whose case started by investigating the dual votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups five years ago.
Qatars 2022 bid has been subject to the heaviest scrutiny and Lynch said at a briefing in London: We will follow the facts and the evidence where it leads us. And regardless of who is handling that investigation, whether its us or the Swiss, I think that Qatars role in it would hopefully be cooperative.
Qatars vast al-Udeid air base outside the capital, Doha, serves as the forward headquarters for US Central Command, and hosts dozens of aircraft participating in the US-led campaign targeting the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.
Lynch said diplomatic and military relations with Qatar were not a factor in deciding whether to act on any evidence of corruption in the World Cup vote.
I think that we make our considerations based on the considerations of the case, based on the evidence, based on the facts, and based on whats appropriate to handle if we were to discover a problem or corruption or a violation of law that led to a US case, we would move on that basis, Lynch said.
Lynch has spearheaded the US Department of Justice investigation into football corruption, which erupted in public in May when 14 people were indicted including Fifa executives. A further 16 men were charged last week over alleged bribes and kickbacks, with two Fifa vice-presidents arrested while in Zurich for an executive committee meeting.
Lynch declined to discuss the suspended Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who is being investigated by the Swiss over a payment to Michel Platini which led to the Uefa president also being suspended by the world governing body."

David Green, the director of the SFO, said that although the Bribery Act had been introduced too late to catch any offences committed during bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, it is actively reviewing recent information related to possible money-laundering.
We are still examining issues around possible money-laundering, said Green, appearing before the Culture, Media and Sport select committee. There are several aspects to it and some new information has come to us quite recently.
He also confirmed that one of the transactions under scrutiny was a A$462,000 payment (around £301,000) to the disgraced former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner from the Australia 2022 bid committee that may have been routed through London.
I cannot confirm the assertion that money went through London  it certainly started off in Sydney and appears to have ended up in Trinidad, he said. It could be money-laundering, yes. Whether the money came through London is important.
There are outstanding matters which touch upon money-laundering. There are a number of matters we are still looking at and digging into.
Under tough questioning from MPs over why the SFO had not been more aggressive in pursuing Fifa corruption, Green said that information received so far did not meet the required level to begin a criminal investigation.
He said that without a criminal investigation it could not request legal assistance from other jurisdictions.
The Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, has expressed surprise that other international jurisdictions had not requested evidence or provided assistance.
But Green said informal requests to the Swiss prosecutor to provide the controversial Garcia report into the 2018/22 bidding process had been rebuffed.
Likewise, Green said that a request to the US Department of Justice to analyse the tapes from undercover meetings between the former Fifa executive Chuck Blazer and other football officials during the London 2012 Olympics had also been turned down because it related to an ongoing investigation.
And he said that although an alleged request for £2.5m from Warner to the former FA chairman Lord Triesman was rotten conduct, his predecessor at the SFO had been unable to investigate.
Green said the SFO cant touch Fifa with the Bribery Act as things stand and said it made more sense to allow the Swiss and US investigations to continue unhindered.
However, the SFO confirmed it had a team of five people that had been analysing 1,687 documents ranging from one to 75 pages supplied by the English Football Association that related to its failed 2018 bid.
Damian Collins, the Tory MP who sits on the committee and is a key player in the Fifa reform movement NewFifaNow, accused the SFO of standing on the sidelines in one of the biggest fraudulent stories the world has ever seen.
But Green insisted part of the investigation remained very much alive. He added: Dont get the impression this is a closed book on a shelf at the SFO. We are getting new information in quite frequently.
Also appearing before the committee, the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith called for more radical and wide-ranging reform to Fifas governance and culture than has been proposed so far.
Goldsmith, who sat on the Fifa reform task force that was set up in 2011 but ultimately dissolved amid frustration at the progress made, called for a strong external body that could oversee reform and hold the organisation to account. There has been a deeply unsatisfactory culture in Fifa for many years, he said.
He also criticised the farce surrounding the publication of Michael Garcias report, with the then head of the investigatory arm of the Fifa ethics committee resigning in fury at what he claimed was an unrepresentative summary of his findings. People need to see that report so that people can see whether there is smoke or fire, said Goldsmith.
Domenico Scala, the head of Fifas audit and compliance committee who will also oversee the election of a new president to replace Sepp Blatter in February next year, had been due to appear before the committee but pulled out a fortnight ago. On Wednesday, the FA chairman, Greg Dyke, is expected to be asked about his stance on the looming election and the wisdom of backing Michel Platini for the role before withdrawing support after he was suspended for 90 days."

It is also understood that it will introduce a requirement forcing bidding nations to comply with United Nations standards on labour laws and human rights.
The chaotic dual race for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, won by Russia and Qatar respectively, was accompanied by claims of collusion and bribes. A clause requiring bidding nations, which included England for 2018 and the US for 2022, to invest in football programmes overseas has been removed after belated recognition that this was virtually an invitation to corruption.
England and Australia were among the bidders criticised for pouring money into football programmes in the Caribbean, and elsewhere, as they tried to woo Jack Warner, the controversial then Concacaf president who is among 14 executives charged by the US Department of Justice with offences including money laundering and tax evasion.
The 2026 process, paused in the wake of the crisis that gripped Fifa after the arrest of seven senior executives in Zurich in May, will also include a clause that forces bidders to comply with UN standards on labour law and human rights. Potential bidders include the US, Mexico and Canada. In the wake of Qatars victory, investigations by the Guardian and reports from human rights groups revealed the often dire working conditions under which the countrys army of 1.4 million migrant workers were toiling to build World Cup infrastructure.
Although the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, who has promised to step down between December and March, has flip-flopped on the extent to which world footballs governing body can exert influence on the issue, the introduction of a clause related to human rights appears to be an attempt to address it.
The Guardian revealed last summer Fifa was considering making a bidding countrys human rights record a factor when awarding a World Cup.
However, it remains to be seen how the new rule will work in practice. The International Olympic Committee also recently introduced new rules surrounding labour laws and the environment as part of its Agenda 2020 process.
In 2013 Fifa amended the bidding rules to ensure the next World Cup host, for the 2026 tournament, would be chosen by all 209 members in an open vote at Fifa congress from a shortlist selected by the executive committee. Fifa ruled last year there was not enough evidence to justify stripping Russia or Qatar of the World Cup in the wake of the publication of a disputed summary of Michael Garcias report, which led to the resignation of the head of the investigatory arm of the ethics committee.
But the 2018 and 2022 vote remains under investigation by the FBI in the US and by Swiss authorities. This week the latter confirmed the number of suspect bank transactions it is examining had risen to 81.
On Monday Blatter will oversee the first executive committee meeting since he promised he would not stand again for the presidency at an extraordinary congress that will take place between December and March.
The meeting is expected to be dominated by his promised reforms, amid calls from external watchdogs including Transparency International for a clean break with the past and the introduction of a temporary committee to undertake wholesale reform."

The wife of the former British prime minister, Tony Blair, exchanged 19 emails with Clinton over four months in 2009 as she sought to arrange the meeting on behalf of Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser al-Missned, an informal but influential ambassador for Qatar on the world stage.
Sheika Moser [sic] has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more positive footing and she was hoping for a women to women one to one private meeting with you, Blair wrote in the first of a series of emails addressed to Hilary [sic] and released by the US State Department after a legal battle to recover correspondence Clinton had stored on a private server.
After initially suggesting they shared a philanthropic interest in disability charities, Blair added: I am sure the conversation would not be confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.
A protracted series of follow-up emails then detail Blairs attempts to seek a mutually convenient date in both womens diaries, some cryptically only referring to my friend from Q.
Great, Blair replied to Clinton when the meeting was confirmed in principle. When I see what a difference you are making it reminds me why politics is too important to be left to the bad people.
Clintons bid for the Democratic presidential nomination has prompted close scrutiny of the Gulf states donations to the Clinton Foundation, which was set up as a philanthropic venture after her husband left the White House.
Clinton has denied that such foreign donations had any bearing on her work as secretary of state, but the foundation has been accused of violating an agreement with the Obama administration to stop taking overseas money while she was in office to avoid any perception of undue influence.
The Blair familys fundraising activities have also led to close scrutiny of their finances since leaving Downing Street, but they too stress that much of their work is philanthropic in nature.
A spokesperson for Cherie Blair said: As the emails make clear, Cherie Blair established a relationship with Sheikha Mozah over a number of years based on their shared interest in disability issues.
Cherie has been a patron of [the charity] Scope for some years, and in that capacity became involved in the Shafallah Centre for people with disabilities in Qatar, in particular as co-chair of its annual disability conference.
She was merely acting as a conduit  on a woman to woman basis between Mozah and Clinton, the spokesperson added.
The emails were exchanged at a time when Qatar was accelerating its drive to invest heavily in London property and businesses while also engaged in a push to bring major sporting events to Doha.
Both were elements of a move to project soft power that intermingled the interests of the ruling al-Thani family and the future of gas-rich Qatar as outlined in the then emirs 2030 Vision plan.
The global education initiative fronted by Sheikha Mozah and the Qatar Foundation, another charitable arm, are also parts of that jigsaw  opening links with other countries away from official diplomatic channels on a sporting, cultural or philanthropic basis.
In 2009, Qatar was in the early stages of a bid to host the 2022 World Cup that would eventually end in victory in December of the following year and has proved endlessly controversial ever since, amid allegations of bribery and collusion.
One of its opponents in the race was the US, with Bill Clinton fronting its bid. Like the rest of the US delegation, Clinton was bitterly disappointed when Qatar overcame its bid.
In May, it emerged that the Qatar 2022 organising committee had made donations of between $250,000 (£160,000) and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2013.
The Clinton emails, which were voluntarily turned over by the secretary of state and released this week by the State Department after intervention by a US judge, also show other close links to the Blair family.
One memo from the informal Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal shows him acting as a go-between to persuade the secretary of state to help promote Tony Blairs short-lived bid to become EU president.
Jonathan Powell tells me that remarks about Tony would be appreciated but that what would really be significant will be your conversation with Merkel, Blumenthal wrote.
He also wrote repeatedly to warn Clinton of declining US relations with Britain, urging her to help the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, repair ties between the countries or risk a still chillier reception from the opposition leader, David Cameron.
Consensus across the board in Britain  center, right, left  is that the Atlantic alliance, the special relationship, the historic bond since World War II, is shattered, Blumenthal said.
There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administrations denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the Bush era.
Other emails show friends of Bill Clinton lobbying on behalf of Israel. I trust I am not violating a protocol, but word has it that the Israeli ambassador has been trying to meet with you to no avail, Brian Greenspun, a former college roommate, wrote.
I cant imagine why your folks would want to keep you two apart. I hear he is solid. So, thats the heads up. I am always available if there is a problem with which I can be helpful, he wrote."

The head of Fifas audit and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, has already reiterated that there could be a revote for 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 tournament in Qatar if clear evidence of bribery emerged.
The Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber, giving an update into the Swiss investigation that is running in parallel to an FBI inquiry that has already resulted in 14 executives being charged and plunged Fifa into crisis, said investigators were examining nine terabytes of data from Fifas Zurich headquarters and Swiss banks.
I am well aware of the enormous public interest in our investigation. Equally enormous is the public interest in an independent criminal procedure, Lauber said. Our investigation is of great complexity and quite substantial. To give you an example: The SAG [Swiss attorney generals office] has seized around nine terabytes of data. So far, our investigative team has obtained evidence concerning 104 banking relations; be aware that every banking relation represents several bank accounts.
He warned there would be interviews of all relevant people and specifically did not rule out interviewing the Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who promised to step down in the wake of the US indictment, and the general secretary, Jérôme Valcke, who is under pressure over what he knew about a $10m payment from South Africa to the Caribbean that US prosecutors claimed was a bribe.
At a press conference in Bern, Lauber said that Swiss banks had fulfilled their obligations to report suspicious banking activity and that the Swiss investigation had not been instigated as a result of the FBI investigation.
The Swiss investigation into the controversial and chaotic World Cup bidding process  in which England lost out for the 2018 tournament and the US among the bidders for 2022  was made public on the same day that US prosecutors alleged a World Cup of fraud stretching back two generations and dramatically arrested seven executives in Zurich.
It has seized data and documents during two visits to Fifas headquarters and collected documents from Swiss marketing agency Kentaro relating to a friendly between Brazil and Argentina in Doha in 2010.
Fifa argued that the Swiss investigation was as a result of it handing over documents relating to an investigation by its ethics committee chief, Michael Garcia, and that as such it was in fact the injured party.
For the time being Fifa is the injured party, that is true. They filed the report and this is the actual status as we conduct investigations against unknown persons, said Lauber, but he warned that could change.
We didnt start the investigation against Fifa. We started the investigations based on that [report] and based on a mutual legal assistance request from the US.
Asked whether the Swiss investigation, which is clearly already broader in scope than Garcias given the Swiss prosecutors ability to examine bank accounts, would tally with Fifas release of the full Garcia report Lauber said he was working to his own timetable and was not concerned about collateral damage elsewhere.
We are faced with a complex investigation with many international implications. The prosecution is ongoing and will take time, he said. It would not be professional to communicate at this moment a detailed timetable. The world of football needs to be patient. By its nature, this investigation will take more than the legendary 90 minutes.
Lauber, who said the huge and complex investigation could take months if not years in places, also emphasised that the Swiss process was independent from the US procedure and that they would not automatically share documents and information.
A disputed summary version of Garcias investigation, which caused the US attorney to quit his post in frustration, raised question marks over Qatars bid but said that there was not sufficient evidence to strip it of the tournament.
The summary, written by the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, said that the Russian bid was unable to cooperate because it had returned its rented computers and lost all its emails.
Under intense pressure, Fifa agreed to publish the Garcia report in full with redactions but has yet to do so while ethics cases against individuals are ongoing.
Scala said last week in the wake of Blatters promise to step down as Fifa president that a revote on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments remained a possibility.
If evidence should emerge that the awards to Qatar and Russia only came about thanks to bought votes then the awards could be invalidated, said Scala, the independent chairman of Fifas audit and compliance committee, in an interview with the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung. This evidence has not yet been brought forth.
Fifas chief ethics investigator Cornel Borbely, who took over after Garcia resigned in December, said he was prepared to widen the net if new evidence came to light.
He said in a statement: The independent investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee is carrying out several proceedings into football officials on suspicion of breach of the Fifa code of ethics based on the findings of the investigation into the decision for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Should new evidence come to light, the investigatory chamber will widen the group of suspects. The Investigatory Chamber has taken the necessary preparatory measures for this and is prepared to increase its staff numbers at any time if needed.
Elsewhere, the Asian Football Confederations general secretary, Alex Soosay, has tendered his resignation with immediate effect. Soosay was suspended last month amid allegations that he ordered a cover-up during an investigation into the organization in 2012."

suspected irregularities and money-laundering over Fifas award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar is examining the money paid for the friendly Argentina played against Brazil in Qatar three weeks before the vote. The Swiss attorney generals office said it took possession of documents on a cooperative basis from the agency Kentaro, which organised the match, and Kentaros chief executive, Philipp Grothe, has said he spent hours with investigators providing information on where the money went.
The revelation that prosecutors are investigating that match has prompted speculation that the money paid was key to securing the votes of the Argentina and Brazil football association presidents, Julio Grondona and Ricardo Teixeira, who were then members of Fifas 22-man executive committee (exco), for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
In March 2012 Teixeira resigned from the exco and his 22-year presidency of the Brazil Football Confederation (CBF), shortly before a Swiss court document was published showing he had been paid millions of dollars in bribes in the late 1990s on Fifas sale of contracts to the marketing company ISL. He was last week indicted by prosecutors in Brazil on charges relating to tax evasion, money-laundering and fraud.
Grondona, who was appointed to head the Argentina Football Association (AFA) in 1979 by one of the leading army figures in the countrys military junta, joined the Fifa exco in 1988 and was the hugely powerful chair of the organisations finance committee until he died last year, aged 82.
It appears, however, that the Swiss prosecutors investigation into the match is not focusing on alleged improper payments from Qatar in return for votes. Fifas investigation into the match, by the former US prosecutor Michael Garcia, apparently did not find that to have been a concern. Instead, the focus appeared to be on whether the agreed portion of $2m legitimately paid to Argentina, via an agency, World Eleven, as the cost of having the all-star national team play the friendly, did indeed reach the AFA. It is two companies in Buenos Aires, unnamed by prosecutors but not including World Eleven, that are understood to be under suspicion.
The Zurich-based financial services firm Swiss Mideast, with close links to Qatar, which organised the financing of the friendly on behalf of the Qatari construction firm GSSG, said it had made no payments outside the $8.6m it agreed with Kentaro as the total cost of the friendly.
Kentaro, which had the rights at the time to the Brazil national teams famous world tour of friendly matches, is understood to have agreed to pay the AFA $2m for playing the match, which included a $400,000 commission to World Eleven in Buenos Aires. The fee to the CBF was less, given the match was part of the long-term contract for Brazil team friendlies; it was just under $1.5m, paid via the CBFs agents, ISE Ltd.
Kentaro was introduced to the opportunity of GSSG financing a friendly in Doha by a company registered in Singapore, BCS Ltd, which was paid a $2m introduction fee. That huge-looking figure for an introduction is said to be in line with market rates in the lucrative world of international football, and the owners of BCS are known football business people whose involvement apparently did not raise concerns. Kentaro sold the TV rights and sponsorship for the game, paying some of the TV rights, just under $300,000, by agreement to GSSG, which retained ticket income in Doha. Kentaro made its profit after the costs of organising the game itself and paying the travel and other costs of bringing the two teams and support staff over to Qatar.
Martin Signer, a lawyer at Swiss Mideast, confirmed to the Guardian that he was involved in organising the match on behalf of GSSG, which had its name as the prime sponsor. Signer said his firm researched the market rate for bringing to Doha the world-class Brazil and Argentina teams and their star players, and found it was in line with the costs presented by Kentaro. Lionel Messi scored the only goal in the game, which was intended to showcase Dohas ability to host prestigious international football just before Fifa voted on whether the country could host the 2022 World Cup.
Signer said Swiss Mideast agreed the contracts and paid the money, Kentaro organised and delivered the match, and no other payments were made.
We did help to organise this match together with GSSG, Signer said. We paid a market rate to Kentaro for the game. It was successful from our point of view.
Despite the concerns raised about payments from the match, and speculation that they involved additional money from Qatar, Signer said Garcia never approached Swiss Mideast at all. I do not know anything about any concerns stated over contractual arrangements or payments, Signer said. No investigators have been to see us, so far.
The basis of the Swiss attorney generals announced investigation was rather lost in the sensational news the same day, of senior Fifa officials arrested in Zurich and charged with racketeering offences by US prosecutors, with six defendants having pleaded guilty. The attorney generals office, and Fifa, made it clear, though, that Fifa itself had made various criminal complaints relating to the 2018 and 2022 votes, based on Garcias report, and the investigation is following them up.
Concerns about payments relating to the Argentina v Brazil friendly in Doha were included in the summary of Garcias report published in November by Hans Joachim-Eckert, the German judge who chairs Fifas ethics committees adjudicatory  decision-making arm. Eckert said that according to Garcias report: The financing of the event and the contractual structures in this regard raised, in part, concerns  in particular in relation to certain arrangements concerning payments intended for the Argentina Football Association.
Eckert stated that: The relevant arrangements were not connected to the Qatar 2022 bid.
Garcia resigned from Fifa in December, after vehemently contesting Eckerts summary. Eckert has rejected that criticism and maintained his document fairly summarised the Garcia reports findings. Garcia has never identified which of his facts and conclusions he claims were omitted or wrongly edited, so it is not known if he argues they include Eckerts summary of his findings relating to the Argentina v Brazil match. Garcia declined to respond to the Guardians questions about it this week.
Fifa said in November that it had referred to Swiss criminal authorities the various findings of wrongdoing by Garcia, which Eckert summarised as limited, and insufficient to compromise the integrity of the bidding process.
The evidence-gathering from Kentaro and investigation of the Argentina v Brazil friendly indicates that the Swiss investigation is indeed following the same lines of inquiry as Garcia, whose whole file and supporting documents, according to Fifa, have been handed over. It suggests that the focus is as summarised by Eckert, about money intended for the AFA. Kentaro is understood to have been presented by investigators with names of companies in Buenos Aires it did not recognise, which may have received money out of the fee intended for the AFA.
Grothe has emphasised that he and Kentaro co-operated fully and voluntarily with Garcia, and is doing so again with the Swiss attorney generals investigation. He said he showed the prosecutors all the money flows, and is adamant the payments were normal for the friendly.
In the wake of the arrests and investigations announced a fortnight ago, the AFA said in a statement that it supports and endorses the inquiries, sharing the concern of the football world about the transparency deserved by our beloved sport.
The Swiss attorney generals office declined to comment on its investigations, saying it is currently analysing seized data and information. Internal discussion on options regarding the ongoing criminal proceedings will follow accordingly."

Amid continuing criminal investigations into the process for the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, the Swiss attorney generals office seized data and IT equipment from Fifas Zurich headquarters as part of a pre-agreed handover of evidence.
The haul is understood to include material from the offices of Blatter and the secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, who is under pressure over a $10m payment from South African World Cup organisers to the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner that US prosecutors say was a bribe.
Valcke said it would be nonsense to begin the 2026 bidding process in the current climate and that whatever the situation at Fifa, the World Cup had to be protected at all costs. The United States, Mexico and Canada are expected to be among those interested in hosting the 2026 tournament. Fifa has ruled the tournament can go to any continent except Asia and was due to be awarded in May 2017 under a revamped process in which all 209 Fifa associations would have a vote.
Swiss prosecutors and the FBI are looking into the controversial bidding process for the 2018 tournament, to be played in Russia, and the 2022 World Cup, awarded to Qatar. A disputed summary of a Fifa ethics committee report last year ruled there was not sufficient evidence to strip either country of the World Cup but the head of the compliance committee, Domenico Scala, has confirmed it remains a possibility if new evidence emerges.
The summary, which sparked the resignation of the reports author Michael Garcia, detailed a list of allegations against Qatar and said Russia had been unable to cooperate because the organising committee had lost all its emails and its rented computers had been returned.
Following a meeting of the World Cup organising committee in Samara on Wednesday, Valcke insisted the Russian World Cup was on track before the qualifying draw in St Petersburg in July and that no wrongdoing against Russia had yet been proved.
Nothing was big enough during the process to say that the final decision was not in line with all the rules and regulations which have been in place. And, in fact, its the same conclusion Michael Garcia had in his report, said Valcke, appearing to suggest he had read the full report.
Valcke also defended Fifas handling of a $10m payment to a Caribbean Football Union account controlled by the discredited Warner. The payment followed a 2008 letter from the South African Football Association to Valcke asking for the money to be deducted for the World Cup budget and sent to a legacy programme to be administered by Warner.
Im signing all the contracts of Fifa, said Valcke, who began his job several months before the money transfers in early 2008 to accounts controlled by Warner.
Valcke, who said he had not been questioned by Swiss authorities or the FBI over the payment, insisted the alleged bribe money did not belong to Fifa and questioned why he was targeted by international media. You have decided that after Blatter, my head is to be cut. Fine, but dont say it is because of this $10m.
Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister who is also head of the 2018 organising committee, said Swiss and US investigations into the Russian bid would find nothing improper. Do not rock this boat, he warned. They said already that Germany wrongfully got their World Cup, or Britain hosted some wrong reception for £40,000. And now it will all snowball. We should understand that we acted within the legal football framework that existed at the time.
His comments were a reference to suggestions in the German media that trade deals played a part in Germany securing the 2006 World Cup and the FAs decision to pay for a Concacaf dinner in the Caribbean. Blatter confirmed his departure in Zurich last week and said he would stay as president until the election, due to be held between December and March. The date of that election will be confirmed at a Fifa executive committee meeting in Russia next month, before the preliminary World Cup draw, with mid-December one possible option.
Meanwhile, the head of the German FA has called for term limits for the Fifa president and suggested the one member, one vote system for Fifas 209 associations should be revisited. Wolfsgang Niersbach also recommended that preliminary technical reports should be used to weed out the weakest candidates for the World Cup.
If Fifa had deployed this process then Qatar, with the weakest technical evaluation, would not even have reached the vote, he said.
The pressure on Fifa will grow on Thursday when the European Parliament calls on Blatter to step down immediately. The motion, which expresses the parliaments long-held view that Fifa is full of systemic, widespread and persistent fraud and corruption, says Fifas credibility will not be restored until Blatter goes and widespread reforms are instituted.
Meanwhile, the Brazil legend Zico has confirmed he intends to stand for the presidency of Fifa, insisting it is his duty."

If evidence should emerge that the awards to Qatar and Russia only came about thanks to bought votes then the awards could be invalidated, said Domenico Scala, the independent chairman of Fifas audit and compliance committee, in an interview with the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung. This evidence has not yet been brought forth.
Scala has made similar comments before but in light of the ongoing Swiss investigation and confirmation that the FBI has now widened its probe to include 2018 and 2022, his intervention takes on a new significance.
New evidence has emerged, meanwhile, alleging that the former Fifa vice president Jack Warner used a $10m payment from Fifa, made on behalf of South African World Cup organisers, for money laundering, personal loans and credit card payments.
The new evidence, obtained by the BBC, appears to show how the 2008 payments from Fifa  ostensibly for a Diaspora Legacy Programme promised by South African World Cup organisers  ended up in accounts controlled by Warner.
JTA Supermarkets, the largest chain in Warners native Trinidad & Tobago, received $4.8m, according to accounts seen by the BBC.
The US indictment that charged 14 Fifa officials of 47 counts of racketeering and fraud had earlier alleged that Warner laundered the funds through accounts held in the name of a large supermarket chain and affiliated investment company in Trinidad.
The documents also show $360,000 of the Fifa money was withdrawn by people connected to Warner, who was president of Concacaf for 21 years until he was suspended in 2011. He stepped down from his Fifa position a year later.
Nearly $1.6m was used to pay Warners credit cards and personal loans, the largest of which was $410,000, according to the BBC.
The new documents show how Warner, implicated down the years in a string of scandals over two decades during which he ran Concacaf as a personal fiefdom alongside the general secretary Chuck Blazer, moved the money around.
Blazer has been cooperating with the FBI since at least 2011, when he was confronted over huge unpaid tax bills on undeclared commission on marketing and TV deals, and pleaded guilty to a string of charges in 2013.
He claimed in his testimony to a US judge, made public last week, that he was bribed in return for his vote on the 2010 World Cup.
The $10m payments, revealed in the US indictment, were among the factors that led to the Fifa president Sepp Blatter promising to step down last week.
His right-hand man, Jérôme Valcke, was revealed to have been told about the payments in letters from the World Cup organiser Danny Jordaan and from the South African Football Association (Safa).
Fifa had earlier claimed Neither the secretary general Jérôme Valcke nor any other member of Fifas senior management were involved in the initiation, approval and implementation of the project.
In a lengthy statement on Sunday, Safa again insisted that it had devised the programme in good faith and that it had not been created in return for Concacafs vote in 2004. It is a shame that this noble effort to support football development has now been turned on its head and camouflaged as a bribe rather than recognising the good that it was intended to deliver to the football programmes of Concacaf, it said.
Warner has continued to deny wrongdoing and in a televised address last week entitled the gloves are off he threatened to unveil an avalanche of evidence that would show why Blatter had resigned as Fifa president just days after winning a fifth term.
But there were renewed calls in Trinidad & Tobago to explain what he did with the cash and why it was paid.
Brent Sancho, Trinidad & Tobagos sports minister, told the BBC: Im devastated because a lot of that money should have been back in football, back in the development of children playing the sport. It is a travesty. Mr Warner should answer the questions.
In a separate development, the Sunday Times has published new claims from a former Fifa executive committee member saying the vote to host the 2010 World Cup was tampered with to ensure South Africa won.
The claims, dating from the newspapers 2010 investigation that led to the suspension of two Fifa executive committee members ahead of the 2018-22 World Cup vote, allege that Morocco actually won the right to host the tournament ahead of South Africa but the result was altered by Fifa.
The former executive committee member Ismail Bhamjee, from Botswana, stated that following conversations with his fellow voters he had calculated Morocco should have beaten South Africa by two votes in 2004. He acknowledged that his fellow members could have lied to him about who they voted for but claimed that Fifa deliberately tampered with the vote.
After talking with everybody ... Whose votes went where? Were all colleagues, you know. And then we found out that actually Morocco won by two votes, the Sunday Times reported Bhamjee as saying.
Bhamjee, who resigned from Fifas executive committee after being implicated in a World Cup ticketing scandal in 2006 and was then suspended in 2010 following the Sunday Times investigation, had also alleged bribery during the 2018-22 race. The Sunday Times says that it supplied the evidence to Fifa five years ago but that it had not acted on it."

The American bureau, which along with the Swiss authorities arrested numerous Fifa officials in Zurich last week on corruption charges, is reportedly examining the controversial awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, whose destinations were decided in 2010. The Swiss authorities had already declared they were investigating the 2018 and 2022 bids.
Jérôme Valcke, the Fifa general secretary, has also said I dont feel guilty despite being at the centre of a storm that alleges South Africa paid $10m to secure three votes for the 2010 World Cup.
I have no reason to say that I shouldnt remain secretary general regarding whats happened in the last days, because I have no responsibility, he told France Info radio. Im beyond reproach and I certainly dont feel guilty. So I dont even have to justify that Im innocent.
According to Reuters, an FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Fifas decision to award the World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively are part of an inquiry that is looking beyond the allegations in an indictment published last week that alleged endemic corruption at the world governing body.
Earlier on Wednesday, Russian officials had said Blatters resignation would have no impact on their preparations to host the 2018 World Cup.
Its not about Russia or Qatar, its about respect to football players, the deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich told the Guardian. Any political interference into football affairs is illegal. Our preparations are going very well, much better than in some other World Cup countries. We have learned from them.
Fikile Mbalula, the South African sports minister, has denied his country bribed Fifa officials in order to secure votes for the 2010 World Cup, even though a $10m payment was made to the Caribbean Football Union.
A letter from the South African Football Association in 2008 was addressed specifically to Valcke and contained detailed information about how the payment  claimed to be for a Diaspora Legacy Programme  should be processed."

Chris Eaton said Fifa ought to look into allegations contained in a new book, The Ugly Game, which expands on a series of reports in the Sunday Times last summer about Qatars successful quest to host the tournament.
If there is new evidence, whatever it shows and whoever it implicates, then Fifa needs to investigate it, said Eaton, who left Fifa in May 2012 to head up the Qatari-funded International Centre for Sport Security. Thats the proper thing to do. Fifa needs to remove the stain on its reputation that the lack of transparency has created.
The book provides further evidence for claims there was collusion between the Qatar 2022 bid and Spain/Portugals bid for 2018, which garnered seven votes for each, detailing exchanges between Bin Hammam, a Qatari who was then a Fifa vice-president, and Villar Llona, who remains on the world governing bodys executive committee.
Eaton was asked to look into the affair for Fifa but ultimately could not prove it, with the then ethics committee chief Claudio Sulser closing the case. However Fifas president, Sepp Blatter, later confirmed that a bundle of votes were traded between Qatar and Spain/Portugal. But it was a nonsense. It was there but it didnt work, not for one and not for the other side, claimed the Swiss, despite Qatars victory. Hans-Joachim Eckert, the German judge who wrote the disputed summary of Michael Garcias investigation into the 2018/22 World Cup bidding process for the Fifa ethics committee, did not even mention the pact.
Garcia later resigned his position in protest as what he saw as a misrepresentation of his findings.
The Garcia report remains unpublished although Blatter, having originally insisted its contents must stay secret, was in December forced to agree to the report being released in an appropriate form once investigations against individuals have run their course.
Those individuals include Villar Llona, cited for non co-operation, and handily for Blatter the redacted version of the report is unlikely to be published this side of the presidential election at the end of May at which he will stand for a fifth term.
Eaton joined the ICSS in May 2012 and there is a chapter in the book related to his attempts to get the Qataris to bankroll the ICSS and employ him as its head. On Wednesday Eaton was unapologetic and said he had nothing to hide. I know my integrity is in the right place, he said.
Elsewhere in the book, which claims to lift the lid on how the tiny Gulf state secured the worlds biggest sporting event, the mystery backer of a friendly between Argentina and Brazil in November 2010, a month before the vote, is reported to be a director of the countrys sovereign wealth fund.
The glamorous fixture between the two South American sides in Doha was seen as part of a final push to secure the votes of the Brazilian Ricardo Teixeira and the Argentinian Julio Grondona, longstanding Fifa executive members with dubious reputations who were among the 14 who would eventually deliver victory to Qatar.
The Ugly Game alleges the friendly was bankrolled by Ghanim bin Saad al-Saad, the managing director of the global property arm, Qatari Diar, and a director of the countrys sovereign wealth fund. The authors, Heidi Blake and Jonathan Calvert, who say they spent months trawling through millions of leaked documents, said that Saad paid large sums to the Brazilian and Argentinian associations and a further $10m to Global Eleven, the company that had the rights to organise Brazils world tour of exhibition matches.
The episode was covered in Eckerts controversial summary of Garcias investigation into the World Cup bidding process.In it he says that a wealthy Qatari bankrolled the event to advance an interest in sport-related investment but that the relevant arrangements were not connected to the Qatar 2022 bid. But Blake and Calvert contend that it is disingenuous to try to separate the resources of the bid from the vast wealth of the Qatari state.
Similarly, Eckerts version of Garcias report concluded that Bin Hammams payments to football officials were made to influence their votes in the June 2011 presidential election rather than to help Qatar win their World Cup bid in December 2010 and that the same applied to his payment of $1.2m to Jack Warner, then a Fifa vice-president, in July 2011. The book, published on Thursday, argues Bin Hammam had a central role in Qatar 2022s victory while keeping his distance from the official bid vehicle.
It claims he used a $5m slush fund to build up favour over a period of time with football officials in Africa and elsewhere, as well as funding expensive junkets to Doha and making payments to Warner. Qatar 2022 and insisted that Bin Hammam had no official or unofficial role within the bid and insiders argue that his activities were designed to build a support base for his ultimately unsuccessful bid to unseat Blatter as president. Bin Hammam has always refused to comment on the allegations.
Almost as soon as Qatar was awarded the World Cup, beating the USA 14-8 in the final round of voting, it triggered a slew of questions over the way the bid was won, the conditions in which migrant workers building the infrastructure to stage it were toiling and the temperatures in which it would be played.
The Ugly Game alleges a tripartite Qatari strategy. First, there was the official bid headed by the chief executive, Hassan al-Thawadi. It spent hundreds of millions on ambassadors, PR, friendlies and travelling to woo executive committee members. Second, and more controversially, there were the various trade deals conducted by senior members of the Qatar hierachy  for example a gas deal with Thailand and an oil alliance with Russia.
All involved insist the trade agreements had nothing to do with the vote. Finally, there was the role of Bin Hammam himself.
Qatar 2022 has always said Bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in the bid and denied any wrongdoing, arguing that it had to convince him of its merits like every other executive committee member. Thawadi said in November that Eckerts summary of Garcias report had exonerated the bid.
It has said it vehemently denies all allegations of wrongdoing and always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity.
Blatter himself has said that there is no chance of the Russian World Cup in 2018 or the Qatari tournament in 2022 being taken away from their respective hosts. The 2022 tournament will now start in November of that year following a decision by the Fifa executive committee last month."

Zwanziger, the former president of the Germany football association (DFB), said that could happen, however, only if a report into how the World Cup was awarded offers details of specific wrongdoing.
The best solution would be not to play in Qatar and to rectify this wrong awarding, he told the radio station Bayern 2 on Tuesday. But that can only happen if the report provides sufficient clues that the awarding broke Fifa ethics rules, he said.
Fifa has been plagued by a wave of scandals and controversy, ranging from allegations of corruption in the joint 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes to a row over $25,000 watches given as gifts to executive committee members at the World Cup in Brazil.
Michael Garcia, the former US attorney for the southern district of New York who investigated the claims and drafted a report, resigned as head of the investigatory chamber of Fifas ethics committee in December, saying he felt he was no longer making progress and that footballs governing body lacked leadership. His report has not been made public, though a redacted version will be published at an undisclosed date.
Qatar was not suitable to host such a World Cup for a number of reasons, Zwanziger, who steps down from Fifa in May, said, citing among other factors the scorching desert temperatures. Fifa is set to move the tournament to winter.
The energy-rich Gulf state has also been criticised over migrants working conditions and protection of their human rights as they build the stadiums. One has to tell candidates [for World Cups[ that sports, football, the clubs and Fifa, they all represent values that we expect to be observed, said Zwanziger."

The report, following a series of hearings last year, claims that large sums of money that were paid to more than 30 African football officials by the Qatari former Fifa vice-president Mohammed bin Hammam helped secure the votes of the Confederation of African Football.
Before last summers World Cup, the Sunday Times published claims that Bin Hammam had distributed more than $5m in cash gifts, expenses and legal fees to officials. Qatar 2022 has vehemently denied wrongdoing and insisted the alleged payments were designed to build goodwill for Bin Hammams campaign to dethrone Sepp Blatter as Fifa president rather than win votes for its World Cup bid. It has claimed that Bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in the bid.
But the reports author, Michael Connarty, having examined the documents obtained by the Sunday Times, said he was convinced they provided evidence of corruption. Given the structured action of this scale and the sums involved, there can be no doubt that there was a direct correlation between these flagrant irregularities and the outcome of the vote, he said.
As well as examining the documents provided by the Sunday Times and questioning one of the journalists involved, Heidi Blake, the parliamentarians also heard from Fifa representatives.
Connarty said he had concluded beyond all reasonable doubt that the payments from Bin Hammam were designed to win the votes of the African members on the executive committee, thus allowing Qatar to eliminate two rival Asian bids  Australia and Japan/South Korea  in the early rounds of bidding.
In these circumstances, Fifa cannot evade the obligation to hold a new vote under its new rules on the allocation of major events including the World Cup, said the report. The claim that Qatar does not have direct responsibility for Mr Bin Hammams dealings should not be allowed to validate a procedure so fundamentally undermined by illegality.

Bin Hammam was banned from football for life in 2011 for offering bribes to Caribbean Football Union officials via the former Concacaf president Jack Warner and before a presidential election in which he was the only challenger to Sepp Blatter.
In a draft resolution, the assembly said it was amazed at the ease with which the adjudicatory head of Fifas ethics committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert, had cleared the Russian and Qatari bids for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments following an 18-month investigation by the US lawyer Michael Garcia.
After Garcia resigned in protest at what he claimed was Eckerts misrepresentation of his report, Blatter insisted that Garcias findings could not be published in full. But he was forced into a u-turn when the Fifa executive committee voted to publish it in an appropriate form in the face of external pressure.
RRussia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments respectively in December 2010 following a convoluted and controversial bidding process that featured allegations of bribery, vote swapping and collusion.
The report, by the Assemblys Committee on Culture, Science, Education and Media, also called on Qatar to urgently take without delay all necessary measures to secure respect for the fundamental rights of all foreign migrant workers employed in this country. Following in-depth reports by human rights organisations and a series of investigations by the Guardian, pressure has grown on Qatar to improve the treatment of the 1.4m migrant workers tasked with building the infrastructure that will host the 2022 World Cup.
We need Fifa to be fully on board and for Fifa to make clear that the implementation of human-rights standards, and particularly those set by the ILO is a condition with which Qatar and other countries staging football events must comply, said the report.
The German Fifa executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said last month Qatar should be given 12 months to implement genuine reform or face losing the World Cup. But Blatter, who will stand for a fifth term in May despite having insisted his current one would be his last, immediately undermined him by saying Qatar would keep the tournament.
The Parliamentary Assembly report also makes a series of other recommendations around financial transparency, term limits and governance reform.
Its about transparency. Its a dark area of sports governance where you cant see into the processes, its not done publicly. So the public dont have any confidence, said Connarty. It is money that is making Fifa a corrupt organisation and we have to clean that up."

As Fifa president Sepp Blatter declared the latest crisis over and insisted we have always been determined that the truth should be known, he simultaneously ruled out a re-vote for the 2018 World Cup in Russia or the 2022 tournament in Qatar.
There is no reason to say that our decisions were wrong. So we will go on sticking to our decisions, said Blatter following a meeting of the executive committee in Marrakech at which it was agreed unanimously, though without a formal vote, to publish an appropriate version of Garcias report.
We will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent, external legal experts supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the executive committees decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, he added.
Expert legal advice sought by Domenico Scala, the head of Fifas audit committee whose responsibility it was to resolve the row over Garcias report, said it was clear the irregularities determined thus far are not of an extent that would lead to the bidding process as a whole being qualified as significantly illegal.
Without huge upheaval or a new element coming to the fore, Blatter said that the verdict of Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert  who produced the disputed summary of Garcias report that precipitated his resignation  that neither Qatar nor Russia had seriously broken the rules would stand.
Around half the 22 voting members of the Fifa executive committee who voted in December 2010 have since left the organisation, many with a cloud of corruption allegations trailing in their wake, and even Eckerts summary highlighted a host of still unanswered questions.
Amid a flurry of familiar Blatter-isms, the 78-year-old declared I am what I am and said that the split in the Fifa executive committee over whether to publish Garcias report had been resolved. We have been in a crisis. The crisis has stopped because we again have the unity in our government, he said.
At the same meeting, Fifa decided that a ban on third-party ownership of players - which could have huge ramifications for football in Portugal, Spain and South America  would be introduced in May 2015. It also said that the controversy over the timing of the Qatar 2022 World Cup, most likely to be moved to November to avoid the summer heat, would be resolved at its next meeting in March.
Blatter said work was also already underway on drawing up a new framework for World Cup bidding, which would incorporate new rules designed to bring some order to a process that rapidly spiralled out of control in the run-up to the dual vote in December 2010. He said the changes would mean everyone can be confident that the 2026 bidding process will be fair, ethical and open.
Scala revealed that Garcias full 430-page report recommended tightening the rules on gifts, friendly matches and football development investment outside the host country, as well as ensuring that only one World Cup was ever decided at a time. Sources said that Scala, who had been given the task of deciding how much of the report the board should see, recommended it be released in a legally appropriate form and that there was agreement around the table. He did not update them further on what is actually contained in the full report and no vote was taken.
However, it remains to be seen how heavily redacted the report will be when it eventually sees the light of day. The identities of all of the 75-plus witnesses are likely to be obscured, unless they agree to waive their right to confidentiality. It is clear that while a summary of the report was issued, the publication of this report has become a barrier to rebuilding public confidence and trust in Fifa, said Blatter, who had initially opposed its release.
The decision was made two days after Garcia dramatically resigned as head of the investigatory arm of the ethics committee in disgust at the way the release of his report had been handled. Blatter confirmed that the former US attorney for the southern district of New York would be replaced as head of the investigatory arm of the ethics committee by his deputy Cornel Borbely.
Garcia was furious that a 42-page summary of his 430-page report prepared by Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of the ethics committee, had, as he put it, misrepresented his findings. Garcia spent 18 months and £6m gathering evidence before Eckert effectively cleared the 2018 host Russia and 2022 host Qatar of serious wrongdoing.
Without the power to compel corrupt former Fifa executives no longer in football to talk and the inability to seize evidence, the former US attorney for the southern district of New York was reliant on witnesses co-operating. The Russians said all emails relating to their 2018 bid had been lost and another of Garcias recommendations for future bids is that all records are retained for inspection and audit.
Garcia opened investigations into the conduct of five individuals during the bidding process including three current executive committee members  ?Ångel Mar?-a Villar Llona of Spain, Belgiums Michel DHooghe and Thailands Wowari Makudi  and one former member, the German Franz Beckenbauer.
The appropriate version of Garcias full report, which the investigator said this week had identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process, wont be released until those individual cases are complete.
But that also raises the possibility of Blatter being able to time the conclusion of those investigations and the subsequent release of the redacted Garcia report to best suit his purposes as he prepares to stand for another four years as president next April, despite having previously insisted his current term would be his last.
It is not my duty to evaluate myself. If you claim that I am a weak leader, then kindly ask the members of the executive committee, he said. This about weak leadership, lets leave that aside. I am what I am."

Michael Garcia resigned after his appeal against the decision to publish what he described as an erroneous summary of his 430-page report was rejected on Tuesday. As he did so he criticised the lack of leadership at world footballs governing body.
The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, in Marrakech for a meeting of the executive committee, said he was surprised by Garcias decision. But few others were, with Garcia making his distaste for the way Fifa had handled his investigation increasingly plain.
Michel Platini, the Uefa president who voted for Qatar but has called on Blatter to stand down as promised next year, said Garcias exit was a new failure for Fifa. Jérôme Champagne, the former Fifa executive who is challenging Blatter for the presidency, called it a step backwards.
The US attorney said there was no point taking his appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation, he said.
Garcia said the 42-page summary published in November by the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, which effectively cleared the 2018 hosts Russia and the 2022 hosts Qatar of serious wrongdoing during the chaotic bidding process, contained numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions.
The former US attorney for the southern district of New York also revealed that Blatter and the Fifa executive committee attempted to refer him to the organisations disciplinary committee in September after he publicly called for the report to be published in full.
He reiterated that his report had identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process despite the fact that he did not have the power to compel corrupt former Fifa officials to cooperate or to seize evidence.
Garcia, who works for the US law firm Kirkland & Ellis, has been scrabbling to salvage his reputation ever since the Eckert summary was released and widely condemned.
He signed up to operate under an ethics code that made clear it was in the gift of the ethics committee to choose only to publish the terms of the decision. He also agreed to protect the anonymity of his 75-plus witnesses. But in a speech in London in September he argued it should still be possible to publish the report in full and suitably redact evidence to protect the identity of whistleblowers, warning Fifas leadership that it required a wholesale culture change. It was that intervention that caused the executive committee to try to refer him to Claudio Sulsers disciplinary committee.
He said that in the first two years following his appointment in July 2012 he felt the ethics committee was making real progress but that there had been a change in recent months. The issues raised by Mr Eckerts selection and omission of material from the report, and his additional comments, went far beyond the initial transparency concerns, said Garcia.
He said a paper he filed on 24 November to Fifa showed why when viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarise, no principled approach could justify the Eckert decisions edits, omissions and additions.
Garcias appeal was rejected on procedural grounds, with the Fifa appeals committee arguing that Eckerts summary was an opinion rather than a judgment and as such there was nothing to appeal against. The five cases already opened against individuals as a result of Garcias investigation will presumably be picked up by an acting chairman who will be appointed by the executive committee at Thursdays meeting, most likely his deputy Cornel Borbély.
They include cases involving the German former Fifa executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer and three current members  Ángel María Villar Llona of Spain, Thailands Worawi Makudi and Michel DHooghe of Belgium.
Bonita Mersiades, the former Australia 2022 executive who had her own complaint against her confidentiality as a whistleblower being apparently breached by Eckert dismissed, said she welcomed Garcias decision.
He joins Judge Günter Hirsch who resigned from the previous ethics committee on similar grounds three years ago. I also welcome the fact that Mike Garcia agrees with what many of us have long stated  that Fifa is incapable of reform or cultural change with its current leadership, she said.
Garcias decision will ratchet up pressure on Blatter to restore some form of confidence in his so-called reform process. I am surprised by Mr Garcias decision. The work of the ethics committee will nonetheless continue and will be a central part of discussions at the exco meeting in the next two days, said Blatter.
In the wake of a wave of corruption allegations that swamped Fifa in 2011, Blatter reformed the ethics committee into a new twin-chamber arrangement, with Garcia heading the investigatory arm and Eckert overseeing the adjudicatory chamber.
At their meeting in Marrakech, the head of the audit committee, Domenico Scala, will update Fifa executives on his deliberations over how much of the Garcia report they should be allowed to see and they will also vote on a motion tabled by the German Theo Zwanziger that it should be published in full. Others, including the American Sunil Gulati, the British Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce and the Concacaf president Jeffrey Webb, have also called for full publication.
Zwanzinger also warned Qatar that they could yet lose the 2022 World Cup if they failed to improve their treatment of migrant construction workers. Qataris must deploy, by a 10 March 2015 deadline, the independent commission  tasked with regularly monitoring human rights conditions at World Cup construction sites and note progress  as demanded in the Piper report, Zwanziger told Sport Bild magazine. Until now apparently not much has happened, he said.
The FA chairman, Greg Dyke, attending a match between the British Army and the German Army match in Aldershot to commemorate the Christmas truce in the first world war, also said he was disappointed at Garcias resignation and Fifas refusal to release his full report. Dyke has consistently said that the leadership at Fifa has to change if its culture is to be overhauled."

In a flurry of press releases, Fifa again attempted to bolt the stable door on its botched investigation into World Cup bidding long after a herd of horses had galloped over the horizon.
Ahead of a pivotal two-day meeting of the Fifa executive committee in Marrakech, its tactic of trying to drown out criticism in bureaucratic gobbledygook appeared unlikely to succeed.
With Fifas executives touching down ahead of a meeting that will again be dominated by discussion of Michael Garcias report, after the German Fifa executive, Theo Zwanziger, forced a vote over whether to publish it in full, a familiar process cranked into gear.
First, its appeals committee rejected a claim from Garcia, the head of the investigative arm of its ethics committee, that Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm, had fundamentally misrepresented his 430-page report.
Eckerts 42-page summary was published last month and effectively cleared 2018 host Russia and 2022 host Qatar of serious wrongdoing despite admitting the former had refused to co-operate, having insisted all their emails had been lost, and a long list of question marks over the latter.
In a move that was a surprise even by Fifas standards, hours after the summary was published Garcia reported his colleague to the appeals committee claiming his summary contained numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.
Yet in a triumph of which Big Brothers Ministry of Truth would be proud, the appeals committee found Garcia had nothing to appeal against. Eckerts summary only represented an opinion, it ruled, therefore Garcia had no case. Minutes earlier, Fifas disciplinary committee had ruled that complaints from two whistleblowers that their confidentiality had been breached also had no merit.
Of all the distasteful aspects of the fallout from the cash-soaked scramble to host the worlds biggest sporting event, the treatment of Bonita Mersiades and Phaedra Almajid is among the worst.
Mersiades was an executive on the Australia 2022 bid and Almajid had a senior communications role on the Qatar 2022 bid. Both had already spoken out about their experiences but agreed to co-operate with Garcia on the agreement that their evidence would remain confidential. Yet when Eckert published his summary  which may or may not be an accurate reflection of Garcias tone  he dismissed their evidence and turned on both. Almajid was, to some extent, compromised by the fact she retracted some of her claims in 2011, later insisting she had only done so under pressure. However, whatever the quality of her evidence, nothing can justify the way she was hung out to dry.
While neither was named, both were easily identifiable. Eckert not only dismissed their evidence but did so despite the need to maintain the confidentiality of witnesses being the main argument employed in favour of publishing a summary rather than the entire report.
Fifa said that the pair had effectively waived their right to anonymity by going public with their own media activities long before the publication of the report summary.
Almajid, who claimed her safety and that of her family had been compromised by the Garcia process, said that was an obvious dodge, insisting she had remained silent throughout the period of the investigation. There also appears to be a discrepancy between the reasons Fifa gave for dismissing her complaint in its media release and those in a letter to Almajid, seen by the Guardian, in which it effectively states she is not entitled to complain because she is no longer working in football.
As for the wider drama, the ball is back in Garcias court. He could now choose to leak his entire report or take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He might prefer to wait until the outcome of Fridays board meeting, during which the head of the audit committee, Domenico Scala, will update members on how much of the report he is prepared to share with them and they will vote on whether to release it in full.
Even if we ever get to see it, Garcias report will not provide all the answers. He was compromised from the start by the fact that he had no power to seize phone records or email traffic and those corrupt former Fifa officials who are no longer involved in the game could not be compelled to talk.
He also has his own questions to answer, having agreed to take on the case under the existing Ethics Code  which states baldly that the ethics committee may decide not to communicate the grounds of a decision and instead communicate only the terms of the decision  only to change his tune when it became clear his reputation was at risk. Garcias appeal loss does not affect his ongoing prosecutions of five men, including the German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer, for wrongdoing in the bid campaign.
Among that five are three current Fifa board members  vice president Ángel María Villar of Spain, Michel DHooghe of Belgium and Worawi Makudi of Thailand. That all three will now vote on whether his report should be released is just another bizarre feature of the process.
The fifth official charged is the former Chile football leader Harold Mayne-Nicholls, who Fifa chose to lead an inspection team evaluating the nine candidates in 2010. With crushing inevitability, the investigation intensified when he revealed he may stand against Sepp Blatter for the presidency next year.
There was a reminder of another of the intractable problems facing the Qatar 2022 tournament when the European Clubs Association and the European professional leagues published a detailed proposal to shift the tournament to May in order to minimise the disruption a move to January or November would cause. It appears unlikely to hold sway, with Blatters favoured option of November remaining favourite.
Meanwhile, the best hope for getting to the truth about what really went on during that much scrutinised bid race  although much of the evidence now lies in plain sight thanks to the efforts of the media  is not Garcias full report but an ongoing FBI investigation.
The presidents strategy appears to be to box and cox his way through to May 2015, obfuscating and obscuring as he goes, when he plans to stand for another term despite previously promising this would be his last. But when youre as practiced in Orwellian doublethink as Blatter, whats one more broken promise?"

Both Phaedra Almajid, who worked on Qatars 2022 World Cup bid, and Bonita Mersiades, a member of the Australia 2022 bid team, complained to Fifas disciplinary committee in the wake of the publication of Hans-Joachim Eckerts disputed summary of Michael Garcias investigation. But the disciplinary committee ruled on Tuesday that there was no case to answer.
I cooperated with Mr Garcias investigation for over two and a half years under a clear, unqualified promise of confidentiality. He asked me for my confidentiality and repeatedly promised me mine, said Almajid.
I kept my promise. Herr Eckert breached that confidentiality. I did not. The disciplinary committees avoidance of this undisputable violation is emblematic of its culture of self-protection.
Eckert not only dismissed their evidence but effectively identified them, despite the need to maintain the confidentiality of witnesses being the main argument employed in favour of publishing a summary rather than the entire report.
Fifa said that the pair had effectively waived their right to anonymity by going public with their own media activities long before the publication of the report summary.
Almajid, who claimed her safety and that of her family had been compromised by the Garcia process, said that was an obvious dodge. My public statements were all made long before I entered into a confidentiality agreement with Mr Garcia. I made no public statements during the entire period of Mr Garcias investigation, she said.
I relied on Fifas promise of confidentiality and continued to honour my promise until Herr Eckert published his summary. My recent public statements have only been made after Herr Eckerts identification of me in blatant violation of Fifa confidentiality rules.
Eckerts 42-page summary of Garcias 430-page report, which effectively cleared the 2018 hosts Russia and 2022 hosts Qatar of serious wrongdoing, did not name either woman. But both argued that its description of them made them easy to identify.
Almajid worked on the Qatar bid in a senior communications role and was behind allegations aired under parliamentary privilege that the African Fifa executives Issa Hayatou, Jacques Anouma and Amos Adamu were given $1.5m each to vote for Qatar. The three have denied the allegations, as has the Qatar bid committee.
She later retracted the claim but has said she agreed to do so only under duress after the Qatar organising committee said it would not bring legal action against her for breaching a confidentiality clause in her contract if she signed a sworn statement.
There also appears to be a discrepancy between the reasons Fifa gave for dismissing her complaint in its media release and those in a letter to Almajid, in which it effectively states that she is not entitled to complain because she is no longer working in football.
Almajid said her treatment was another blow to Fifas credibility, ahead of this weeks executive committee meeting at which members will vote over whether the Garcia report should be released in full.
The disciplinary committees decision today is one more example of an organisation whose rules are mere formalities meaning nothing, she said. Woe be to any other person who cares enough to risk personal safety to report Fifa corruption."

Garcia last month claimed a statement by the Fifa ethics judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, on his report into bidding for the World Cups had contained numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions and announced he would appeal.
That appeal has now been declared inadmissible by Fifas appeals committee, which said Eckerts statement was not a legally binding decision and therefore could not be appealed against.
Eckerts statement said any rule breaches by the bidding countries were of very limited scope, adding: In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it.
A Fifa statement said: The Fifa appeal committee, chaired by Larry Mussenden, has concluded that the appeal lodged by the chairman of the investigatory chamber, Michael J Garcia, against the statement of the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the independent ethics committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert, is not admissible.
The said statement about the report on the inquiry into the 2018-2022 Fifa World Cup bidding process does not constitute a decision and as such is neither legally binding nor appealable.
Meanwhile, complaints by two World Cup bid whistleblowers that their cover had been blown by Eckerts findings have also been rejected.
Phaedra Almajid, who worked for the Qatar 2022 bid team before losing her job in 2010, and Bonita Mersiades, who worked for Australias 2022 bid, complained that promises of confidentiality had been breached because his findings contained more than enough information to make them easily identifiable."

Sulser ruled that both women had gone public with their own media activities long before last months publication of the summary of the investigation by the Fifa ethics judge, Joachim Eckert. The report did not name them.

The German Fifa member Theo Zwanziger will formally put forward the proposal at the ExCo meeting in Marrakesh.
It is understood, however, that Zwanziger has proposed that the names contained in the 430?page report compiled by Fifas chief ethics investigator, Michael Garcia, be redacted.
Fifa published its agenda for the meeting on Thursday but confirmed that, under Fifa ethics committee business, there will be 13.1.3. Proposal submitted by Theo Zwanziger.
Zwanziger wants fellow members to agree to a change of the ethics code which, via Article 36, currently prohibits the publication.
Garcia has compiled a report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. The American lawyer has also appealed against the initial findings into his report, delivered by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert which criticised Englands bid but cleared Russia and Qatar to host the tournaments.
Zwanziger told the Germany press agency DPA: I would like to see this ban relaxed so that the Fifa executive committee, as well as the public, in an appropriate form can be informed of the contents of the investigation.
Zwanziger has previously said awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was one of the biggest mistakes ever in the history of sport and in September suggested it will be moved from the country due to the scorching heat.
Fifa responded to that remark by insisting the tournament will definitely be staged in Qatar  a process is under way to decide on what time of year it will be held."

Having received information from the Sunday Times about a host of unproven allegations that have swirled around the winning bids from Russia and Qatar since the vote in December 2010, the select committee published the allegations under parliamentary privilege.
The allegations include claims that Qatar and Russia engaged in a vote-swapping pact as part of a huge gas deal, that the vote of the former Fifa executive committee member Franz Beckenbauer was touted for sale by two associates and that a Cypriot voter, Marios Lefkaritis, was wooed with a huge land deal worth £27m.
The dossier also includes longstanding rumours that the Russian bid distributed fine paintings in order to woo key voters. The Belgian exco member Michel DHooghe has admitted receiving a painting but said it was valueless.
Qatar and Russia have strongly denied all allegations of impropriety and Beckenbauer, who it emerged last week was one of four current and former exco members under investigation by the Fifa ethics committee, has also previously denied any wrongdoing.
Lefkaritis, whose land deal was previously revealed by France Football magazine, has also denied wrongdoing.
John Whittingdale, the chairman of the CMS select committee, said the FA still had questions to answer after the newspaper collated evidence from sources on the England 2018 bid team.
The select committee will want to hear from the FA. We have questions to ask of the FA. If this dossier exists, we will ask to see it and we have the powers to do that, he told the Guardian. But even if it confirms suspicion of corrupt practices, then it is hard to see what more we can do, he said.
The latest claims heap further pressure on Fifa amid the controversy surrounding an investigation by Michael Garcia, chair of the investigatory arm of its ethics committee.
He disowned a 42-page summary of a 430-page document that was compiled by the Fifa ethics committee judge, Hans-Joachim Eckert, and pressure has been building for the full report to be published ever since, with appropriate redactions to protect whistleblowers.
It emerged last week that serving exco members Worawi Makudi, DHooghe and Ángel María Villar Llona were among those individuals under investigation by Garcia, along with Beckenbauer.
The select committee previously conducted an explosive inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 bidding process, under which the former FA chairman Lord Triesman aired claims under parliamentary privilege that voters including Jack Warner and Nicolás Leoz sought inducements in return for their vote.
It emerged shortly after the 2010 vote that Englands bid team had hired investigators to help compile an intelligence database on the other bidders and the 24 exco members.
It was common knowledge during the campaign that overseas embassies and the Foreign Office were also helping to keep track of the flurry of speculation that surrounded the bids.
It has long been suggested that Russia and Qatar used new and existing trade and diplomatic links to try to secure votes.
On Sunday the FA moved to defend its behaviour during the course of the bid and during Garcias investigation.
England 2018 was disproportionately criticised in Eckerts summary, which effectively cleared Qatar and Russia of serious wrongdoing. It said it had fully engaged with Garcia and had not withheld any of the intelligence gathered by the bid that had been requested by the investigator.
The England 2018 chief executive, Andy Anson, said that he shared anything he believed could be substantiated with Garcia and that everything else was hearsay, gossip and rumour.
An FA spokesman said: The Fifa ethics committee made specific requests and responding to these requests involved searching in excess of half a million documents. The search parameters were established with Mr Garcias office.
The documents searched included intelligence gathered by the bid team. All documents within the search parameters were disclosed.
In addition Andy Anson has confirmed that any intelligence that he believed could be substantiated was shared with Mr Garcia in his interview and that everything else was hearsay, gossip and rumour."

The SFO is believed to be speaking to various other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, as it weighs up whether there is enough evidence to launch a criminal investigation in the UK.
In response to a letter from Damian Collins MP, the SFOs general counsel Alan Milford said every reasonable line of inquiry, including working closely with appropriate overseas authorities, is being pursued to ascertain whether the director has grounds to open an investigation.
An FBI investigation into former members of Fifas executive committee has been continuing since 2011 and it emerged last month the former Concacaf general secretary Chuck Blazer had been recruited to secretly record colleagues during the London Olympic Games after being accused of not paying his taxes.
They have confirmed they are actively looking into it, talking to relevant agencies  the FBI and the Swiss Authorities. They could make an application to see the Garcia report. That may well be what they are doing in terms of the conversations they are having with other agencies, Collins said.
The SFO also told Collins it had appealed for whistleblowers to get in touch. The email address is understood to have been passed on to Phaedra Almajid and Bonita Mersiades, the two whistleblowers who were left feeling traduced by the way their evidence was treated by judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the judiciary arm of the Fifa ethics committee.
The SFO has previously told the Guardian it does not yet have jurisdictional grounds to open an investigation but it would continue to actively look at the case and keep it under review.
Collins said the matter would be raised in an adjournment debate in the Commons on Monday. On Wednesday, the culture secretary Sajid Javid wrote to Blatter to urge him to publish the Garcia report in full. The US attorney disowned the summary of the report produced by Eckert, saying it did not reflect the facts or his conclusions.
Domenico Scala, the chair of Fifas audit committee, is considering how much of Garcias report can be shared with the Fifa ethics committee before their next meeting in December.
The Fifa vice-president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein has yet to decide whether to stand against Blatter. Some figures within Uefa are privately urging the Jordanian to stand in next years presidential election, but his office said on Wednesday that he had yet to make up his mind."

Michael Garcia, the US attorney who heads the investigatory arm of Fifas ethics committee, met with Hans-Joachim Eckert, the German judge who is chairman of the adjudicatory chamber, at Fifas headquarters a week after the former had disowned the latters summary of his £6m, 18-month probe.
In a joint statement they said they would make Garcias full report available to Domenico Scala, the head of Fifas audit and compliance committee, who in turn would decide how much information should be made available to the full 26-strong Fifa executive committee.
Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, has insisted the report cannot be published in full for legal reasons but several members of the executive committee, including the Concacaf president, Jeffrey Webb, the US Soccer Federation president, Sunil Gulati, and the Uefa president, Michel Platini, have called for full disclosure.
The investigatory chamber has already opened a number of formal cases against individuals as a result of that inquiry, said Garcia and Eckert in a joint statement. Neither the recent referral of the reports to the Swiss Federal Public Prosecutors Office nor the request to the chairman of the Fifa audit and compliance committee will interfere with those ongoing proceedings.
Both chairmen stressed the vital role of the Fifa ethics committee in ensuring the highest standards of ethics and governance at Fifa. Irrespective of the independence of the two chambers, the two chairmen regard good communication as key to fulfilling that role.
Communication was in short supply in the runup to the publication of Eckerts 42-page summary, which effectively cleared Russia and Qatar of serious wrongdoing and praised Fifas robust process. Garcia wanted as much of his full report published as possible and dismissed Eckerts summary as a misrepresentation of the facts and conclusions within it.
While their decision makes it more likely more details from Garcias full report will seep out, it will do little to quell fears the process has been less than transparent. It also sets in train a bizarre set of circumstances in which the Fifa executive committee will be deciding what action to take against itself and former colleagues.
Even if Garcias full conclusions do emerge, he was still hamstrung in his investigation by the fact he could not compel witnesses no longer in football to talk and had no power to seize emails or phone records. The Russia 2018 bid claimed their computers had been destroyed and Garcia was unable to speak to six of the 11 members of the Fifa executive committee who have since quit footballs beleaguered governing body. The latest developments in the farcical saga came on a day that began with a former Fifa ethics committee member claiming one of the executive committee asked for a $5m cash bribe during the bidding process. Les Murray, an Australian broadcaster, said an unnamed executive had asked for hard cash and he had passed his concerns to the committee.
Canover Watson, a member of Fifas audit and compliance committee, has been charged with fraud, money-laundering and breach of trust by police in the Cayman Islands. The cases relate to Watsons time as the head of Caymans Health Service Authority with no suggestion of football-related crimes. Watson, a vice-president of the Caribbean Football Union, has previously denied the allegations."

Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge, summarised the report into allegations of corruption over the award of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022 to Russia and Qatar that was written by the US attorney Michael Garcia. Mr Garcia strongly disputes Mr Eckerts summary. On Monday, two whistleblowers whose identities were revealed by Mr Eckert also claimed that he had misrepresented the evidence. Mr Garcia should leave Fifa in no doubt that if they will not publish his report, he will. But that will be only the first of many steps needed to rebuild a governing body for global football worthy of universal confidence.
It is easier to say what should be done than it is to be confident that it will happen. Most effective would be criminal prosecutions. In the wake of the Garcia report, the FBI is reported to be accelerating its probe, started in 2011, of the conduct of Fifa officials. In the UK, the Tory MP Damian Collins has called for the Serious Fraud Office to pursue a parallel investigation. Then, Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president who first won a contested election amid allegations of fraud in 1998, must step down rather than stand for another four-year term next year. That might be achieved if, as the former FA chairman David Bernstein has suggested, Uefa backed a boycott of Russias World Cup in 2018  or even, as the German league president Dr Reinhard Rauball suggested yesterday on Monday, threatened to walk away from Fifa entirely. Best of all, to launch the new era, would be a rerun of the ludicrous vote that resulted in Qatar being awarded the 2022 competition. Of all the damage done by Fifa corruption, the leverage presented to Qatar by its status as a World Cup host is the worst. Later today it will probably be awarded the World Athletics Championships for 2019, one more sports-hosting trophy to add to the dozens already in its portfolio as it strives to cultivate an image of modernity that disguises a cruelly exploited workforce, a gross disregard for human rights and colossal environmental degradation.
On the face of it, European football should be in a strong position to impose its will. But if a World Cup without Spain or Germany would be a meaningless affair, there is no unity of purpose. Spain and Portugal were exonerated in the Eckert summary and might not wish to get involved. Uefas president, Michel Platini  once spoken of as a challenger to Blatter  actually voted for Qatar. A Uefa boycott would risk looking like a self-interested rebuff to the rest of the world. And, whatever noises it is making now, in practice the English FA might be a reluctant player too. It has a large debt on the new Wembley stadium that needs servicing through the income from hosting World Cup qualifiers. Worse, it is on shaky ground, after its conduct was strongly, if not justly, criticised by Mr Eckert. Yet Fifa has turned the game it is supposed to foster into a global farce. It has resisted reform for 20 years. Each attempt at challenge leaves victims, people who have done the right thing and suffered for it. And that weakens the resolve to try again. This time must be different."

According to Eckerts summary, to the extent that there was some improper conduct by at least some bidding nations, these activities were not suited to compromise the integrity of the bidding process as a whole.
Who, outside Zurich, Munich, Moscow, Doha and New York  if Garcia really did write such nonsense  believes that?
Not Phaedra Almajid, the Qatar whistleblower who kept silent for two years, handed over voluminous material including FBI-gathered evidence and was then trashed disgracefully by Eckert.
Nor I  who was asked by Garcia to take part in his investigation 18 months ago. I had low expectations of an investigation by Fifa of Fifa from someone paid by Fifa. But, having been asked, I felt the responsible thing to do was to share with him what I knew and what I had observed; I explained to him up front that I had no smoking gun but lines of inquiry that might be useful, depending on what else he learned. Like Phaedra, I was traduced by Eckert.
It says much about Fifa and those inside its tent that it felt it necessary to engage in a denigration of the two women who had been courageous enough to say something. It is one thing to discount our discussions and the evidence  an investigator is entitled to do that  but it is extraordinary to single out two individuals and detail (mostly incorrectly) the contact with Garcia, especially when we were assured in writing and in person that our dealings with him were confidential. The question is why?
In my case I know that Fifa and Fifa insiders are very aware that I have written a book  The Bid: Secrets of the Battle to Host the World Cup, not yet published  about the bid, as Fifa staff have asked me about it. In Phaedras case she is familiar with the Qatar 2022 bid.
But the real issue here is Fifa. If you look beyond the comedic conclusions of the Eckert summary, it shows that there were several flaws to the bidding process, the key of which revolves around the notion of legacy. Based on the practices of many bidders, legacy projects became favours sought and gained by executive committee members under the guise of football development.
One example alluded to by Eckert was a $500,000 football development gift given by the Australian bid to upgrade a stadium in Trinidad and Tobago in September 2010. The stadium was owned by Jack Warner and his family. In April 2013 an independent inquiry into Concacafs finances showed that the money ended up in Warners personal bank account.
Even if we give the Australian bid the benefit of the doubt and assume they were not aware of who owned the bank account, it: a) begs the question as to why Australia and others thought it necessary to give such gifts; and b) proves the point that, even if an individual project was inherently worthwhile, there was no guarantee that these legacy gifts were received by the intended recipient. In other words it was an area made for abuse.
Australias experience in the battle for 2018 and 2022 World Cups is a salutary one. We were seduced by the potential of a turbocharge to the game domestically; the strategic advice of three international consultants was unquestionably accepted by bid leaders and we paid A$15.2m [£8.5m] of taxpayers money for their services. Plus, we were naive enough to believe that, when an ExCo member said we had his vote in a secret ballot, he actually meant it.
These were among the many issues I discussed with Garcia on three occasions, including when he asked me to travel to New York to meet him.
So what happens now? Let the Fifa pantomime play out: Garcia reports; Eckert summarises; Garcia appeals against the summary; Eckert admonishes Garcia for talking to the media. In other words pull up a chair, take out the popcorn and see what happens next.
But let the fans, players and media who love the game unite to affect change  because change will not happen from within Fifa. Time and time again it has shown itself to be incapable of real reform. The only way things will change is if governments, sponsors and broadcasters take the lead on our behalf and say enough is enough. We need an IOC-like reform.
Football should have an international governing body that has the transparency and accountability we expect of our governments, major institutions and organisations, be responsible to the many millions of people who play the game and the billions who are fans, and meet standards befitting its $1.4bn turnover.
Fifa needs a clean slate. Governments, sponsors and broadcasters should demand an interim time-limited administration, led by an eminent person with a broad mandate to develop a new constitution, governance arrangements and policies and conduct new elections.
This is why I am pleased Phaedra and I have been invited by the MP Damian Collins to take a big idea like this forward. Fifa deserves condemnation as it has brought football into disrepute  not on the field but off it.
Players and fans have a right and responsibility to shape international and local football environments. We have the right and responsibility to champion reform rather than passively accepting Fifas flawed governance. And we have the right and responsibility to be part of it.

blown by Fifas summary of its probe into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments have submitted complaints about their treatment at the hands of investigators.
Phaedra Almajid, who made allegations about Qatars 2022 World Cup bid, said her identification has threatened the safety of her family. She has written to Michael Garcia, the head of the investigatory arm of Fifas ethics committee, to protest at her treatment. Her intervention comes amid growing disquiet about the way whistleblowers who spoke to Garcia under condition of anonymity have been publicly traduced by the judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, whose 42-page summary was disowned by the New York attorney.
Eckert  who has already said he will not publish the full 430-page report  and Garcia plan to meet on Thursday to try to settle their differences over the investigation that cleared Russia, winner of the 2018 vote, and Qatar of serious wrongdoing.
Bonita Mersiades, the former Australia 2022 executive who gave evidence to Garcia on three occasions under condition her anonymity would be protected, has also submitted a letter of complaint to him. It says much about Fifa and those inside their tent that they felt it necessary to engage in a denigration of the two women who had been courageous enough to say something, said Mersiades in an article for the Guardian. It is one thing to discount our discussions and the evidence  an investigator is entitled to do that - but it is extraordinary to single out two individuals and detail (mostly incorrectly) the contact with Mike Garcia, especially when we were assured in writing and in person that our dealings with him were confidential.
In Almajids letter, seen by the Guardian, she said she had agreed to speak to Garcia despite no longer working in football but did so in the belief the true facts known to me are important to the purposes of your investigation.
My cooperation was based on your promise of confidentiality. You have said that in the course of any investigation [you are] bound by confidentiality, and also want to protect anyone who would wish to come to me in good faith. As an organisation, Fifa has stated the identities of the people you spoke with  other than serving football officials or employees  would remain confidential.
Almajid pointed out the promises of confidentiality were repeated by Fifas chief legal counsel, Marco Villiger, two months ago at the height of a debate about whether Garcias report should be published in full. Ironically, Fifa claimed that one of the main reasons for producing a summary rather than publishing the full report was to protect the anonymity of whistleblowers.
As I have explained to you and your colleagues, confidentiality was crucial to my cooperation with your investigation, considering my personal circumstances, particularly the safety of my two sons and me, she said.
Not only was Herr Eckerts summary a crude, cynical and fundamentally erroneous description of me and the information and materials I provided your investigation, it directly breached Fifas assurances of my confidentiality.
Like Mersiades, Almajid saw her evidence discredited in Eckerts disputed summary of Garcias report. Eckert said Mersiades, who is not named but is easy to identify from the summary report, provided some useful information but claimed the evidence did not support its specific recollections and allegations and further undermined its own reliability by speaking to the media.
The German judge said Almajid provided voluminous records and other information but said there were serious concerns about the individuals credibility and therefore the report had not relied on any information or material she provided.
Almajid worked on the Qatar bid in a senior communications role and was behind allegations aired under parliamentary privilege that the African Fifa executives Issa Hayatou, Jacques Anouma and Amos Adamu were given $1.5m each to vote for Qatar. The three have denied the allegations, as has the Qatar bid committee.
She later retracted the claim but has said she agreed to do so only under duress after the Qatar organising committee said it would not bring legal action against her for breaching a confidentiality clause in her contract if she signed a sworn statement. In 2011, Almajid signed a statement in which she said she had fabricated her original allegations and had not been put under any pressure, or received any financial inducements, for retracting the claims.
She said at the time the decision was entirely my own and she felt sorry and guilty for undermining the credibility of the ultimately successful Qatari bid. Fifa said it could not comment on the complaints by the whistleblowers before they were examined by the Fifa disciplinary committee.
It said Eckert had not named them to protect their personality rights. Almajid and Mersiades were not named but they argue they are easily identifiable from the summary published by Eckert.
Fifa also said the discussion and the public letter by Phaedra Almajid and Bonita Mersiades underline exactly the confidentiality issue concerning any of the witnesses when talking about a publishing of the full report.
It has argued that publishing the full report will undermine the confidentiality of witnesses.
Although Herr Eckert did not name me in his report, he directly identified me and my information by connecting it to my publicly reported statements three years ago. Within hours of publication of Herr Eckerts summary, I had already been widely identified as one of the whistleblowers in German and British media, Almajid wrote.
As if identifying me were not enough, Herr Eckerts report falsely discredits me in order to support his indefensible conclusion that the December 2010 bidding was wholly acceptable.
She said that Eckert had put her safety and that of her family at risk by effectively singling her and Mersiades out from the 70-plus witnesses who spoke to Garcia, making their evidence easy to identify.
In any organisation  particularly one with huge resources and global reach like Fifa  protection of insiders who expose wrongdoing is essential to an honest and healthy business. Identifying me and falsely discrediting me sends a message to anyone who may think to come forward that their credibility and protection will be in jeopardy for the rest of their lives, she wrote.
I have taken great personal risks to stand up for the truth in a highly politicised atmosphere. However I have found myself betrayed and denigrated for being courageous enough to come forward with critical information.
My fate reveals much about Fifa and its modus operandi. A culture of silence is rewarded; those who speak out and dare to question the system are not just cast aside, but ironically denied any protection or respect under Fifas own code of ethics.
Hours after Eckerts summary, which effectively cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, Garcia complained that it misrepresented the facts of his report and his conclusions and reported the matter to Fifas appeals committee.
In a joint statement, the pair complained that Eckert had broken rule 16.1 of the ethics committee code, which guarantees confidentiality to whistleblowers.
The summary by Judge Eckert clearly breached all such assurances of confidentiality. Although not named in the report, we were clearly identifiable and within hours of its publication had been widely unmasked as the whistleblowers in German, British and Australian media, they said.
To compound this situation Judge Eckert used his summary report to question our credibility. This is particularly puzzling as the summary simultaneously uses the same information we provided to form significant parts of his inquiry in respect of the Australian and Qatar World Cup bids."

Among the key Fifa figures who made the process so tight in 2010, as Sepp set about shaping the decade (Im working to make football a school of life, bringing hope, bringing emotions!):
1) Michel Zen-Ruffinen, Fifas secretary general until 2002, filmed before the process began setting out what it would cost to buy the votes of key executives. The biggest gangster on earth wanted £350,000; another was a guy you can [get] with ladies, not money.
2) Nigerias Exco member Amos Adamu, caught naming his price in a Sunday Times sting, months after telling colleagues: The public sees every football administrator as corrupt, and I cannot explain why it is so. We must always be transparent to prove them wrong!
3) Botswanas Ismail Bhamjee, caught in the same sting offering to work as a fixer, four years after being caught in his first sting  touting 2006 World Cup tickets at three times face value to supplement his £270 daily expenses. I got myself in a mess. It was out of character.
4) Qatars Mohamed bin Hammam, who stayed transparent, revealing the scale of vote-trading should not surprise anybody, confirming he was looking to the interests of Qatar, and paying the legal fees for Tahitis Qatar-supporting Reynald Temarii, another sting victim. Last weeks report found Bin Hammam had no impact on the process, and no direct links to the Qatar bid team  whose head described him four years ago as definitely our biggest asset.
5) Thailands Worawi Makudi, who denied allegations over Qatari business deals; Cyprus executive Marios Lefkaritis, who entered into a £27m oil and land deal with Qatari interests, denied wrongdoing, and voted Qatar; and Frances Michel Platini, who voted Qatar for football reasons.
6) Brazils Ricardo Teixeira, who said press interest in his ethics record was shit, denied multiple fraud allegations, resigned for health reasons and last year failed in a residency application to Andorra, a tax haven with no extradition treaty.
7) Cameroons Issa Hayatou and Ivory Coasts Jacques Anouma, who both denied receiving £916,000 to vote for Qatar. Sepp said a later International Olympic Committee inquiry into Hayatou was pure hypocrisy. The IOC? They have no transparency! They manage their money like a housewife.
8) The USAs Chuck Blazer, who denied fraud then turned FBI informant after facing a multi-million dollar tax bill; and Argentinas late Fifa vice-president Julio Grondona, who denied voting for Qatar in return for $78.4m plus the proceeds of a Brazil v Argentina friendly in Doha on the eve of the vote to ease his FAs debt crisis. Enough with all this. The belittling of my good name must end.
9) Russias Vitaly Mutko, who attacked the English press ahead of the vote for portraying Russia as a hotbed of corruption, days before a Russian federal audit chamber report found he had claimed expenses for 97 breakfasts eaten during a 20-day trip to Vancouver.
10) And Trinidads Jack Warner  who kept his nose clean and told the press: Fifa preach equity. We live by our principle of fair play!
Sepps immediate priority in 2011 after the results were in - setting out what was needed to restore Fifas image: a) More transparency - Im fighting to clean Fifa, and zero tolerance is my battle horse, and b) Less press scrutiny. The British press have always been very critical. It didnt start with me - its been like this a long time. They have a sort of stubbornness.
Also spotting the problem:
1) Julio Grondona, June 2011: We always have attacks from England which are mostly lies, with journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth. This upsets and disturbs the Fifa family.
2) Jack Warner: railing against new press foolishness this year, a repeat of 2010s BBC foolishness, 2011s astounding nonsense, and 2012s damn foolish reports. His overall view: Allegations are made every day, every week, every year. Im not interested in that.
3) Nicolás Leoz, Paraguays Fifa executive, unhappy last year after the German press alleged he voted Qatar after also soliciting a bribe. A while ago the press in England were at it, now the German press do it. I dont know, what is it that drives these people?
Best unguarded moment: Sepp, February 2011, letting loose after the dust settled: Ill be honest. There was a bundle of votes between Spain and Qatar. It was there. But it didnt work. Last weeks report found no conclusive evidence of collusion.
Best endorsement: Sep 2013, Vladimir Putin weighing up what he had learnt since 2010, while unveiling Russian gas giant Gazprom as an official Fifa partner. The work Fifa do is noble. Unlike many other associations that proclaim nice, well-intentioned goals, they actually work to realise them. This has no precedent.
Tidiest investment: £4.4m - Qatars reported spend on bid ambassadors during the process, plus a £250k gifts budget for VIPs and VVIPs visiting Qatar, where 4,000 migrant workers are expected to die before 2022.
And the best media campaign: The Sun, writing an open letter to Sepp on the eve of the vote in 2010, attacking the BBCs Panorama for sabotaging Englands bid. Today the Sun makes this plea to Mr Blatter and Fifa: dont be put off by the BBC rehashing ancient history. Despite BBC muckraking, the Sun trusts Fifa to put football first. (Nov 2014, the Sun: Fifa is a festering boil on the face of football.)
Testing Fifas sense of closure: investigator Michael Garcias appeal against the summary of his inquiry, which he called incomplete and erroneous. The case will be heard by Fifas 14-man appeals panel, including Madagascars Ahmad Darw, who received $10,000 from Bin Hammam in 2008, and asked for more in 2010 via email: As regards to what I discuss with the President Bin Hammam in Qatar  He promise to give me a help  Two possibility to send it  by bank swift or I can take it in Paris. Darw denies wrongdoing.
Sepp, reflecting on his lot in a speech to the Oxford Union in October last year: There are not many names the media havent thrown at me in the last few years. I would be lying to you if I said it didnt hurt. You ask yourself: What have I done?"

In a day that would have stretched the imagination of the writers of the BBCs Olympic comedy Twenty Twelve, it has suppressed its own report into the circumstances surrounding the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 world cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. The summary published instead was immediately disavowed as erroneous and incomplete by the man who conducted the investigation, the US prosecutor Michael Garcia. The summary exonerated Fifa, Qatar, Russia and almost every other participant in the bid process except Englands FA. Fifa is no stranger to farce. But the levers for change remain frustratingly out of reach.
Mr Garcia brought a reputation acquired as an effective and diligent prosecutor in New York to his investigation of the bid process. But with no power to compel witnesses, nor to demand the production of documents, it was all too easy for the bidders to make their excuses. Many of those involved opted for less than total disclosure, most egregiously the Russians, who explained that they could produce no emails as they had rented the laptops they used and these had subsequently been destroyed. But the FA, with the regrettable exception of the then FA boss, Lord Triesman, did cooperate. Its reward for exposing the detail of this inglorious episode in its history, which included raising £3m from hard-pressed local councils, is to be held up for criticism for inappropriate spending. Australia was criticised on similar grounds.
Even more absurdly, the 42-page summary, prepared by the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert who chairs the adjudication arm of the ethics committee, confirms many of the allegations of corruption made at the time of the votes on the World Cup. But its overall conclusion is that the process was sound. A long list of charges alleging Qatari involvement in corruption were largely upheld, but  according to Mr Eckert  despite involving millions of pounds they were not enough to have compromised the bid process. Nor was there enough evidence to support any charges at all against Russia. Fifa has seized the moment to declare the whole affair of the World Cup votes closed.
Not if Mr Garcia has his way. He is demanding that as much as possible of his 430-page report is published, without compromising the anonymity he promised to whistleblowers. Unfortunately his only recourse is an appeal to another Fifa committee. He should publish regardless. But while that may provide further confirmation of Fifas dodgy dealings, the record suggests its unlikely to lead to reform. The prospect of an FBI investigation  one of the triggers that led to the overhaul of the International Olympic Committee after the Salt Lake City scandal  could jolt the executive committee into action. A coordinated threat to Fifas income from TV rights and sponsorship would add pressure. And the FA itself might finally recognise its responsibility to footballs fans and lead a boycott of Fifa, withdrawing in all but name from the committees and procedures of the tawdry, discredited outfit that represents the worlds favourite game."

Michael Garcia, the former attorney for the southern district of New York hired as part of a drive to revive Fifas image, complained that a 42-page summary of his 430-page report contained numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts.
In a Kafkaesque twist, he immediately reported the chair of the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee, the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, to the appeals committee of the scandal-plagued governing body.
Garcias dramatic intervention came just hours after Eckert had confirmed the Guardians revelation that Russia and Qatar would be cleared of substantive wrongdoing and would not be stripped of the tournaments despite a whirlwind of speculation.
Instead, the English bid for the 2018 World Cup and the Australian bid for 2022 came in for criticism. Englands bid team, praised for co-operating with Garcias investigation, was criticised for trying woo then Concacaf president Jack Warner by paying £35,000 for a dinner and offering to find a part-time job for someone on his behalf.
Russian bid executives claimed that all their emails were wiped from their rented computers. Alexei Sorokin, who runs Russias 2018 organising committee, denied a deliberate cover-up.
The Conservative MP Damian Collins, who has been campaigning for reform of Fifa, said the report was a whitewash and the Football Association rejected criticism of Englands bid team. The bids former chief operating officer, Simon Johnson, called Eckerts summary a politically-motivated whitewash.
The decision to award Qatar the 2022 tournament in December 2010 was hugely controversial. In addition to bribery allegations, there was concern about the searing heat in which it would be played and the treatment of migrant workers building the infrastructure underpinning it.
Eckerts summary listed a number of areas of concern around Qatars hugely well funded bid, including its offers to fund football development around the world, its sponsorship of the African Football Congress in Angola in 2010 for $1.8m and concerns over payments made to Argentina when the South Americans played Brazil in a friendly in Doha in 2010.
But he said in each case that either Qatar had not broken any rules or there was not a sufficiently well established link to the organising committee.
Likewise, Eckerts disputed summary of Garcias report said that the link between payments made by the Qatari former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam and the Qatar 2022 bid could not be proven.
The summary of the report confirmed Hammam made several improper payments to high-ranking African football officials and paid $1.2m to the former Fifa executive committee member Jack Warner to stop him testifying against him. But it insisted none of these payments were related to the bid for the World Cup.
It also found Hammam offered to pay the legal fees of the banned Reynald Temarii, the Oceania confederation president who had promised his vote to Qatars rivals, in an effort to persuade him to appeal and so stop his replacement from taking his place and voting for Australia.
Again, Eckert found that while it was clear that Hammam supported Qatars bid, there is no direct link between the payments of Mr Bin Hammam to Mr Temarii.
He added that had Temarii taken part in the vote, it would have made no difference to the outcome. Qatar received 14 votes in the final round of voting; Australia was eliminated in the first round with just one despite spending $40m of public money on its bid.
Incredibly, Eckert described the chaotic bidding process before the vote in December 2010 as well thought out, robust and professional. Yet Garcia recommends that the process should be fundamentally overhauled and eight-year term limits for Fifa executive committee members introduced.
Lord Triesman, the former FA and England 2018 chairman who was forced to stand down in May 2010, said: If they were really serious they would have simply published Michael Garcias report. The lack of transparency speaks volumes in my view about the culture of Fifa.
It shows what the culture of the place is like. Even with the limitations on the document, he describes it as being a thin line between spreading money around for good works in football and things thought of as improper. That is because no one sought to define for bidding nations what is and isnt proper.
Fifa said it had yet to receive formal notification of Garcias appeal. The dramatic intervention made public a long-running private stand-off between Garcia and Eckert over the handling of the report.
In a sign that the botched release of the report and the subsequent hit to Fifas already tattered credibility could be a watershed moment, big name players joined the chorus of criticism. The Manchester City captain, Vincent Kompany, said on Twitter that Fifa was playing a dangerous game. My summary of the report: Desperate Need For Change, he added.
Despite promising anonymity for whistleblowers in order to encourage them to give evidence, Garcia favoured publishing as much of his 430-page report as possible  with redactions where required.
Eckert insisted on publishing only his interim 42-page summary of the findings, with a promise that any sanctions against individuals would be decided by the spring.
Meanwhile, the FBI has stepped up its own investigation into allegations of tax evasion and money laundering involving former Fifa executive committee members. It emerged recently that former Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer was forced to help the FBI investigate his colleagues by wearing a wire at the London 2012 Olympics after running up huge tax debts on undeclared income.
Fifa welcomes the fact that a degree of closure has been reached with the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber stating today that the evaluation of the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process is closed for the Fifa ethics committee, said Fifa prior to Garcias intervention.
As such, Fifa looks forward to continuing the preparations for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 which are already well under way.
That degree of closure, which would have suited president Sepp Blatter as his campaign to be re-elected for a fifth term in April next year, now appears some way off."

Fifa said on Thursday that it was still to receive formal notification but once it does the matter will be considered by its appeals committee, chaired by the Bermudan Larry Mussenden.
Meanwhile, Sepp Blatter will continue to plan his campaign to be re-elected for a fifth term as Fifa president in April next year despite having earlier insisted this would be his last. With no credible challenger having emerged up until now, he is likely to retain his vice-like grip on power despite all the controversy and chaos surrounding his organisation.
While he would have hoped that Eckerts summary would provide closure on a long-running thorn in his side, Garcias intervention means that will not come for some time yet. Nor are those losing bidders still outraged by the decision to choose Qatar, particularly the USA, likely to give up.
They, and campaigners for Fifa reform, will now be turning their attention to the outcome of an FBI investigation into the affairs of former Fifa executives that has been running for at least three years."

Russia attempted to retrieve old emails via a request to Google USA but were unsuccessful. The report states that gifts handed out to executive committee members were of incidental value and, along with accommodation costs for executive members and their families, did not violate any rules. There was no evidence of collusion between the Russian and Japanese bids.
The joint bid from Iberia is the only one not mentioned in the document.
Cleared of any wrongdoing, the Euro 2000 hosts provided full and valuable cooperation with the report and the investigatory chamber did not identify any issues with their bid.
Heavily criticised for attempting to woo Jack Warner, then a Fifa executive committee member. Warner showered the England bid team with inappropriate requests and they reportedly obliged, sponsoring a gala dinner in Trinidad, trying to help an associate of Warner find a job in the UK and providing benefits for a football club he owned in Trinidad. The attempts to indulge the Concacaf president damaged the integrity of the process according to the report, which criticised the former FA chairman and bid leader Lord Triesman for not cooperating with the investigation.
The successful 2022 bidders cooperated fully but the report states that the conduct of two individuals who acted as consultants and advisers to the Gulf state raised concerns, characterised by a lack of transparency. The role of Mohamed bin Hammam is not linked to the bid, with the former AFC presidents payments to CAF officials described as unrelated to the Qatar team and instead connected to his ambitions to become Fifa president. Bin Hammams legal payments to Reynald Temarii, which resulted in the removal of one vote, are also dismissed as having no direct link to Qatar 2022. The countrys sponsorship of the 2010 CAF congress in Angola created a negative impression while a friendly between Brazil and Argentina in Doha also raised concerns.
No evidence that the USA entered into an agreement with another Fifa member association or bid committee, despite pulling out of the 2018 and focusing on the 2022 bid. The American gifts made available to executive members were of symbolic nature and not aimed at influencing the bid.
There existed potentially problematic facts and circumstances regarding the idea of a Global Football Fund proposed by Chung Mong-joon, a Fifa executive committee member and honorary president of the Korean FA. The $777m development was linked to the bid but not mentioned in official bid documents, creating at least the appearance of a conflict or an offer of benefits to executive members.
The value of gifts handed out by the Japanese bid team ranged from $700 to $2,000 each. Japan provided full and valuable cooperation but although Fifas executive members denied receiving improper gifts from the bid, the report states those explanations are troubling.
Report says Australia did attempt to gain the support of a Fifa executive member. The OFCs seeking of financial support from Australia also undermined the processs integrity. Report highlights payments from the Football Federation of Australia to Concacaf which appear co-mingled with personal funds of the then Concacaf president [Warner]."

Garcia said: Todays decision by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber contains numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions detailed in the Investigatory Chambers report. Which parts of the report could have been misrepresented and which facts may have been omitted?
In the 42-page report, bid teams are accused of wrongdoing and unethical activity. The report raises serious questions about the Australian 2022 bid and the English bid for the 2018 World Cup and there appear blatant attempts to secure executive committee votes through lucrative gifts, event sponsorship and suspicious funds. However, on countless occasions the report states that the bids do not compromise the integrity or unduly influence the process.
The Gulf states position as 2022 hosts has come under severe scrutiny following a string of corruption allegations. The summary report does raise significant concerns about Qatars bid, not least for paying $1.8m (£1.14m) to the Confederation of African Football, yet a number of specific corruption allegations outlined in this years Sunday Times reports are not discussed in detail. It was alleged the former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam used a $5m slush fund to pay bribes and that he coordinated global trade deals for the Qatar bid. There are details payments made from Hammam to former Fifa executive committee member Jack Warner, but no mention of an alleged Caf junket in Doha.
Eckerts summary report states that Hammam paid $1.2m to Warner and several improper payments to high-ranking African officials. Fifa has always insisted Hammams payments were an attempt to secure the Fifa presidency rather than win the 2022 World Cup for Qatar. It does not divulge any evidence as to why Hammams corruption was unrelated to the Qatar bid, even though it is adamant in its stance.
The report accepts that Hammam paid legal costs to Temarii, then OFC president, in order for him to appeal against Fifas decision to suspend him before the World Cup votes in 2010, thus meaning he could not be replaced and eliminating a potential opponent to Qatars bid. The report says there is no direct link between Qatar 2022 and any payments of Mr Bin Hammam to Mr Temarii despite it being evident he influenced the voting process by eliminating votes for Australia and England.
The report states there is no sufficient evidence suggesting the Russian bid committee unduly influenced the process en route to securing the 2018 World Cup. However, the Russians made only a limited amount of documents available to Garcia, explained by the fact the rented computers the bid team were using have since been destroyed. The Russian bid committee made an unsuccessful request to Google USA to obtain old emails. Russia insisted there was no collusion with other bid teams regarding the vote yet the report refers only to statements from the parties involved as evidence.
Fifas investigatory chamber sought to interview all 24 members of the executive committee involved in the 2018 and 2022 votes, including Amos Adamu and Temarii who were suspended before the voting. All executive members from 2010 who are still on the committee submitted answers to written questions, although two had initially refused to be interviewed. However, of the other 11 members from 2010 who no longer operate on the committee, three declined or did not respond to the request, two were unable to be contacted and another cooperated only after ethics proceedings against him were initiated. The report does not name any of the individuals in question.
Two female whistleblowers who revealed information about the Australian and Qatari bids for 2022 are discredited in the summary report. In the case of Australia, the source in question, who claimed that money was paid to Warner and offered investigators direct access to her computer to obtain emails dating from her time in the bid team. However, the report states her evidence did not support its [the whistleblowers] specific recollections and allegations and that she did not protect the integrity of Fifas investigation by speaking to the press. Regarding the Qatari case of Phaedra al-Majid, who retracted initial claims that executive committee members accepted bribes, the report states serious concerns about the individuals credibility were apparent from the outset.
Despite insisting the lack of transparency regarding the 2018 and 2022 bids will not be repeated, the tone of the 42-page report is certainly not emphatic in the sense of reform. While admitting there is room for improvement, the report states Fifa designed a bidding process for the Fifa World Cup which was well-thought, robust and professional. It goes on to say to assume that envelopes full of cash are given in exchange for votes is naive and that from which point lobbying for votes becomes improper conduct is not always clear.
The intention of this report was never to argue the case for a World Cup in Qatar. However, after digesting the 42-page document, the familiar unanswered questions return. For example, what was it that compelled the 14 executive committee members to vote to stage a World Cup in a Gulf state where temperatures routinely soar above 40C and when the competition looks set to be staged in winter, during the middle of the European season?"

committee chaired by Father Jack Hackett,"How much corruption is too much corruption? The Fiver doesnt know, but Fifa seems to have a handle on it. When world footballs governing body decided to investigate itself for awarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively, nobody was realistically expecting them to find themselves guilty of any kind of skulduggery. Having appointed former New York district attorney Michael Garcia to compile a secret 430-page report into the bidding processes, Fifa then got their Ethics Committee apparatchik Hans-Joachim Eckert to publish his own summary of Garcias report. Daubed in whitewash across the front wall of Fifas Zurich HQ with a big brush, it read: MOVE ALONG! NOTHING TO SEE HERE! OK, so the Fivers paraphrasing slightly; what Eckert actually said was that, while the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was a little bit corrupt, it certainly wasnt corrupt enough to merit any action so sensible as taking the tournaments away from the two countries involved and restaging the process.
Once Eckhart decided that Garcia had decided there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest any link between Qatars successful bid and the squillions of dollars in bribes paid to various Fifa officials by a Qatari colleague for no reason whatsoever, he concluded by describing the bidding process that had been investigated as well thought out, robust and professional before welcoming the fact that a degree of closure had been reached over the matter. The reaction? Proper Journalists everywhere switched their BS-detectors to 11 and set about rubbishing his claims, while in the public relations equivalent of a dog whistling innocently while walking away from an amber puddle on the kitchen floor, Fifa promptly sent out a press release about the heartwarming legacy of South Africa 2010: Corruption? What corruption? Look! Smiling street urchins! We did that!
But if Fifa might have considered the matter of closed, their own snoop did not. Having had his investigation hampered by uncooperative and often unavailable witnesses, not to mention mysteriously wiped Russian computers among other obstacles, Garcia promptly came out swinging haymakers. Todays decision by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber contains numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions detailed in the investigatory chambers report, said Garcia, who said he will launch an appeal to Fifas ethics committee, who will promptly reject it out of hand. Fifa have yet to respond to his claims, but may do so by getting Sepp Blatter to hold up a photo of a grinning elephant playing keepie-uppie on Table Mountain.
Having exonerated themselves of any ethical shortcomings, Fifa also decided to lecture others on their lack of moral probity, aiming several pot-shots at their old friends in the Football Association for the manner in which they went about bidding for the 2018 World Cup. Getting stuck into them for the manner in which they degraded themselves by attempting to cosy up to disgraced former Fifa official Jack Warner in the style of a pole-dancing Alan Partridge. As criticism goes it was thoroughly deserved, even if it does smack of being lectured on anti-social drunken behaviour by a committee chaired by Father Jack Hackett. Unlike international footballers attempting to play in Qataris 50-degree heat, Fifas latest embarrassment looks set to run and run.
At West Ham he plays behind the strikers and that is not his position. He is a centre-forward and if there is a team out there willing to let him play in his natural role, then we will be very happy to consider it  At this time you could get Zarate for a much lower price than he is really worth. Anyone who decides to go for him will certainly be getting a bargain  Mauro Zarates Mr 15%, Luis Ruzzi, fails to add that theyll also be getting a player whose Mr 15% will throw a strop on his behalf if hes not being played exactly where he wants.

In three years as attorney for the Southern District of New York, Garcia spearheaded corruption investigations into the Iraqi Food For Oil programme and the Norwegian oil company Statoil.
In his role as a counter-terrorism prosecutor for George Bush, Garcia supervised a number of high-profile international cases such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and the 1998 US Embassy bombings in east Africa.
At home, Garcias tenure as the so-called Sheriff of Wall Street would come in for criticism over his allegedly relaxed attitude towards regulation of the financial services industry.
In contrast, Garcia proved persistent in his pursuit of New Yorks Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer, who was ultimately forced to resign in March 2008 as a result of a prostitution scandal.
After leaving the attorneys office shortly after the Spitzer case in 2008, he became a partner at the international law firm Kirkland, whose offices are based in New York and Washington.
In April 2013, Garcia was among 18 Americans banned from entering the Russian Federation over alleged human rights violations, in a direct response to President Obamas Magnitsky List, which had barred a number of Russian officials from US soil.
Not the kind to go quietly, Garcia criticised the report on his investigation into Fifas bidding processes, indicating he would take it up with Fifas appeal committee over numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts."

2022 World Cup bidding process with a spick and span bill of health was plunged immediately into further discredit when its own investigator, the former US prosecutor Michael Garcia, protested that its portrayal of his report was erroneous and incomplete and he himself will appeal.
That was dramatic, edging again into Zurich farce, but no great surprise, because while Fifa had congratulated itself with characteristic smugness, saying Garcias report cleared its integrity and should constitute closure, even the 42-page summary of the report screams the opposite. Garcias report was only commissioned in response to huge concerns over Fifas integrity and that of its executive committee members, who in December 2010 sent the 2018 World Cup to Russia and 2022 to Qatar, in that closed, claustrophobic process.
Several appalling instances of apparent corruption, collusion and vote-buying are identified even in this summary, spun by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chair of Fifas ethics committees adjudicatory chamber, of an investigation for which Garcia did not have full cooperation, particularly from Russia. Yet complacency, in the face of dreadful, apparently institutionalised graft, seeps from every paragraph of Eckerts statement, in which he repeatedly concludes that Garcias findings, even on limited evidence, do not compromise the integrity of the Fifa World Cup 2018/22 bidding process as a whole.
In reaching that conclusion, which was depressingly expected, Fifa has again damaged its own integrity, because it cannot seem to recognise the gravity and unacceptability of corruption within its moneyed walls. This summary report is of a piece with the attitude of Fifas president, Sepp Blatter, who has served footballs world governing body at the highest level during a time of proven bribe-taking, cash presidential vote-buying and other corruption by several of its executive committee members, but kept calm and sailed on, mostly reserving anger for the media which has exposed it.
Eckert recites some of the dire facts already known: that even before the vote in 2010  for a tournament Fifas own report states now to be worth $4bn  two of the 24-member exco, Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, were suspended after a Sunday Times sting found them receptive to vote-buying in return for financial investments.
Fifa merely proceeded with 22 voting members in that trademarked way of Blatters  the captain of Fifas little bateau, as he put it when he was re-voted in as president five months later, in June 2011, on a one-man ballot paper.
Of the other 2010 exco members, Mohamed bin Hammam, Blatters challenger until he was suspended for handing out cash in brown envelopes to Caribbean football delegates whose presidential votes he was courting, was finally banned for life in December 2012 on other corruption allegations.
Jack Warner, a very senior exco baron at the time of the World Cup votes; the president, no less, of the Confederation of North, Central and Caribbean football associations (Concacaf), and a Fifa vice-president, resigned in June 2011 corruption allegations. Eckerts summary report highlights personal benefits Warner sought while dangling his World Cup vote, including from the English Football Association, which is horribly tainted by its willingness, time and again to curry favour and meet Warners expectations.
Blatter has long clung to the comforting falsehood that the English media only reports all this because England lost out, but he should realise there is outrage here that the FA spent £21m of football money, and £3m public money from 12 hard-up local authorities, courting a corrupt Fifa. If it is true they bent over to comply with improper requests for favours, that  and those who did it  should be fully exposed.
Chuck Blazer, long Warners executive at Concacaf and another exco voter for 2018 and 2022, has also now been the subject of corruption findings by an internal investigation, although he continues to deny wrongdoing.
Three other voting members of the exco who sent that great and most lucrative of sporting showpieces to Russia and Qatar, Nicolás Leoz of Paraguay, Ricardo Teixeira of Brazil itself, and Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, were exposed afterwards for having received cash, described as bribes, from Fifas appointed marketing company, ISL, years earlier. Blatter was found in a court settlement to have known of the bribes but Fifa said he committed no wrongdoing because such commercial payments were not a crime in Swiss law at the time. That in itself sums up Fifas attitude to integrity.
Just one of those incidences ought to be enough for most modern organisations  let alone the one entrusted with the worlds most beloved sport and the tournament which transfixes children  to express disgust and cancel decisions taken by these men. But Blatter and Fifa have always just seemed indignant about thedoubts cast on the vote.
Fifas statement, calling for closure, would suggest that Garcia found nothing, but he has identified a lot, even without the Russian bids cooperation  their computers were only leased and have now been destroyed, Russia apparently said, while Google US would not cooperate with their requests to recover emails.
Of Qatar, the tiny gulf autocracy which  without question  bid for and won the World Cup due to its natural gas cash billions, there are several questions. The activities of two individual advisers are said to have raised concerns, as did a Brazil v Argentina friendly in Doha in November 2010, and money which then found its way to the Argentinian FA  whose president, Julio Grondona, had a World Cup vote.
The sponsoring of the Confederation of African football associations congress in Angola in January 2010, in return for Qatars exclusive access to it, may have cost the $1.8m stated, the summary report says, but that is unclear. No rules outlawed a bidding country lavishing such expensive benefits on a voting confederation, Fifa says  without much sense that the organisation recognises how awful this is in itself  and while the lack of transparency creates a negative impression, Eckert decided it was not relevant to affect the 2018/22 World Cup bidding process as a whole.
Even more outlandish is its shortsection on Hammam. He is a Qatari, and was a longstanding, rich and powerful member of the exco, who in 1998 masterminded Blatters presidential election over the Uefa challenger, Lennart Johansson. Hammam decided to challenge Blatter for the presidency. The report confirms the Sunday Times stories, based on internal leaked emails, that he made cash payments to senior figures of Caf associations. Yet Eckert concludes that this was to influence votes for his presidency, not World Cup votes, which those particular Caf members, Eckert says, could not influence. So that was all right then, and does not at all sully the integrity of the World Cup vote.
Most blatant, the report finds another Sunday Times story correct, that Hammam offered to pay the legal costs for Temarii to appeal against his suspension, because for convoluted reasons, this favoured Qatars position in the World Cup vote. Yet still, Fifa can see no evil even there, and Eckert says that as Hammam did not have a formal, documented connection to the official Qatar World Cup bid, helmed by the professional and apparently decent young executive Hassan al-Thawadi, even this did not affect the outcome of the Fifa 2018/22 World Cup bidding process as a whole.
And there lurks a significant little difference. Where elsewhere in his summary Eckert concludes that problems do not affect the integrity of the process, with Hammams actual manipulation of the vote itself, Eckert conclusion is that it did not affect the outcome.
Therein lies the truth of this hideous saga, the whitewash of a necessarily incomplete investigation into a blatantly unsatisfactory voting process by an exco which was endemically corrupt at the time. Fifa does not want the headache of cancelling the votes and re-running the bids. Rather than admit to their faults, it would prefer the World Cup to go to Russia in 2018, where the bid team gave incomplete cooperation with this investigation, and 2022 to Qatar, moved from the summer, necessitating a massive construction programme in a place where migrant workers are treated appallingly.
In this, Fifa fails heartbreakingly fails again to give a semblance of the leadership which its privileged position ought to necessitate as the governing body of the great game, whose simple beauty is so continually betrayed by the people in charge of it."

As revealed by the Guardian, the governing bodys ethics committee has decided after an 18-month investigation by the former New York district attorney Michael Garcia there is not sufficient evidence to justify stripping either Russia or Qatar of the 2018 or 2022 tournaments.
The report did note computers used by the Russian bid had been destroyed and emails were unavailable to investigators. Alexei Sorokin, who runs Russias 2018 organising committee, denied a deliberate cover-up. He said: Everything we could supply to the investigation, we did.
The decision to award Qatar the 2018 tournament in December 2010 was hugely controversial, prompting an avalanche of allegations about the way it won the bid and concerns about the searing heat in which it would be played and the treatment of migrant workers building the infrastructure underpinning it.
In a 42-page summary of Garcias 430-page report, Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of Fifas ethics committee, said while there were concerns over aspects of Qatars bid they were not serious enough to warrant reopening the process.
In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it, Eckert said.
Significantly, Eckert concludes Garcia did not find any direct link between the World Cup bid and illicit payments made by the disgraced former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam, a Qatari who was banned for life for paying bribes during a campaign to unseat Sepp Blatter as Fifa president.
Garcias report established Hammam made several improper payments to high ranking African football officials and paid $1.2m to the former Fifa executive committee member Jack Warner to stop him testifying against him. It said none of these payments were related to the bid for the World Cup.
It also found Hammam offered to pay the legal fees of the banned Reynald Temarii, the Oceania confederation president who had promised his vote to Qatars rivals, in an effort to persuade him to appeal and so stop his replacement from taking his place and voting for Australia.
Again, Eckert found that while it was clear Hammam supported Qatars bid, there is no direct link between the payments of Mr Bin Hammam to Mr Temarii.
He adds that had Temarii taken part in the vote, it would have made no difference to the outcome. Qatar received 14 votes in the final round of voting; Australia was eliminated in the first round with just one despite spending $40m of public money on its bid.
While certain Qatari officials could yet be punished by the ethics committee, Eckert concluded: The potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report concerning the Qatar 2022 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the 2018/22 bidding process as whole.
Qatar spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a campaign of unprecedented scope and scale that included hiring such as Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane as ambassadors and arranging friendlies in Doha.
Eckert says Garcia had concerns over payments intended for the Argentina FA related to a friendly with Brazil a month before the vote but concludes the arrangements were not connected to the bid.
And while he confirms Qatars payment of $1.8m for the rights to sponsor the Confederation of African Football Congress in Angola, thus gaining exclusive access to four of the 24 executive committee members, created a negative impression, he said they did not break any bidding rules.
As regards the procedural framework for conducting bidding procedures related to awarding the hosts of the final competitions of World Cups, the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee did not find any violations or breaches of the relevant rules and regulations, he concluded.
Of the 11 men who voted on 2018 and 2022 World Cups who are no longer on Fifas executive committee, only five provided answers to Garcias inquiry. Two could not be located at all.
Fifa welcomed the decision to close the investigation into the chaotic and confusing bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, which virtually invited collusion by requiring the nine bidders to travel the world trying to secure the patronage of 24 Fifa executive committee members.
Incredibly, Eckert described the bidding process  which Blatter has acknowledged should not have decided two World Cups at once  was well thought out, robust and professional.
Fifa welcomes the fact that a degree of closure has been reached with the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber stating today that the evaluation of the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process is closed for the Fifa ethics committee, said Fifa in a statement. As such, Fifa looks forward to continuing the preparations for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 which are already well underway.
Garcia makes a series of recommendations for how the process should be reformed. Fifa has already promised to base future decisions on a vote by all 209 members at its congress rather than its executive committee.
Garcia also recommended a maximum limit of two four-year terms for Fifa executive committee members without exception or possibility for renewal in an effort to end the system of patronage that has hobbled attempts to reform the organisation.
He said the investigation had noted unfortunate patterns in the history of the 24 member 2010 Fifa executive committee and also recommended members should not be allowed to take part in votes in which they share a nationality with one of the bidding nations.
The Qatar 2022 supreme committee, which recently acknowledged the best time to play the tournament would be in winter amid a debate about the football calendar, said it would study the report in detail before responding.
The publication of the report is likely to be greeted with relief in Qatar. At the height of the Guardians revelations about the treatment of migrant construction workers in the tiny Gulf state and a Sunday Times investigation that sought to link Hammam payments to the Qatar 2022 bid, there was concern in Doha they could lose the World Cup.
As we have noted in the past, we cooperated fully with the ethics committees investigation and continue to believe that a fair and appropriate review will demonstrate the integrity and quality of our bid, it said."

The behaviour of several of the bidders involved in the convoluted and ill-conceived dual bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is expected to be called into question, including Russia, Australia, Qatar and England.
Individuals who are no longer involved in football  including Jack Warner, Mohammed bin Hammam and Reynald Temarii  are expected to be criticised but the summary of the report does not at this stage name any other names.
Nor is there believed to be a smoking gun that links the behaviour of Mohammed bin Hammam, the Qatari former Asian Football Confederation president who was banned for life for offering bribes to officials during his challenge for the Fifa presidency, with the Qatar 2022 bid.
Russia, which won the right to stage the 2018 tournament, is understood to be criticised for its failure to co-operate with the investigation and is believed to have claimed that its computer systems were wiped in the wake of its victory so few email trails exist.
Hans-Joachim Eckert, the German judge who is head of the judiciary arm of the Fifa ethics committee, will produce a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the investigation conducted over 18 months by Michael Garcia.
Aside from Russia and Qatar, the bidding nations comprised England, Holland-Belgium and Spain-Portugal for 2018, and the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea for 2022.
According to sources, the plague on all their houses nature of the summary makes it even less likely that the investigation will lead to either Russia or Qatar being stripped of the tournament.
The Sunday Times uncovered evidence that Bin Hammam had made a series of major payments to football officials during his presidential bid that amounted to millions of dollars, which coincided with the Qatar 2022 World Cup campaign, leading to genuine concern in Doha that Fifa would strip them of the tournament.
Australias bid, which cost taxpayers $40m and received just a single vote, also came under scrutiny for development funds paid and gifts distributed in parts of the football world in which influential Fifa executive committee members had votes.
Garcia was compromised from the start by the fact that he had no power to seize phone records or email traffic and those corrupt former Fifa officials who are no longer involved in the game could not be compelled to talk.
Those involved in the ill-starred England 2018 bid are believed to have co-operated freely with Garcia. As a result Englands bid  which cost £21m and gained just two votes  is likely to be disproportionately criticised for relatively minor infractions.
They could include the Mulberry handbags given to the wives of executive committee members during a visit to London and the decision to pay for a Concacaf dinner in the Caribbean fiefdom of the controversial ex-Fifa vice president Jack Warner.
Despite limited powers, Garcia has been determined to investigate as best he can, travelling to each of the bidding nations to gather evidence. Garcia is banned from Russia under a tit-for-tat response to US sanctions and the reports into the Russian bid and the USA were compiled by Garcias deputy, Cornel Borbély, to avoid conflicts of interest.
The bid process was hit by a series of corruption claims, including the allegation that Qatar colluded with Spain to swap votes and evidence that two members of the Fifa executive committee sought sweeteners in return for their vote.The 42-page summary of the former New York district attorneys 430-page report has itself been mired in controversy as Fifa has come under pressure to publish the investigation in full.
With whistleblowers interviewed by Garcia having been promised anonymity, Eckert has insisted that he will only publish a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report, as well as a brief evaluation of the same.
Others, including Garcia himself, have pushed for the full publication of the report with names redacted. The investigator is understood to have made a number of recommendations about how the bidding process could be improved in future, as well as recommending sanctions against certain individuals.
It remains unclear whether Eckert will name names at this stage, promising sanctions by spring next year. Regardless, he has said that any decision on whether to strip Russia or Qatar of the World Cup would be taken by the Fifa executive committee and not by the ethics committee.
Much of the credibility of the report rests on whether Fifas twin chamber ethics committee, set up in the wake of the avalanche of corruption allegations that engulfed world footballs governing body in 2011, is seen as truly independent.
Meanwhile, the FBI is continuing to investigate claims of tax evasion and money laundering related to former Fifa executives."

The allegations, part of an investigation into Chuck Blazer by the New York Daily News, prompted the Conservative MP Damian Collins to renew his call for the SFO to investigate long-standing bribery and money-laundering allegations surrounding Fifa.
The newspaper claimed that, faced with a bill for unpaid income tax on millions of dollars of hidden earnings stretching back over a decade, Blazer agreed to cooperate with an investigation by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service. Blazer recorded meetings on a bug hidden inside a key fob while staying at a Mayfair hotel during the Olympics. Most of footballs most senior figures were in London during the Games for meetings on the fringes of the sporting event.
Those Blazer invited to the meetings included the Russia 2018 organising committee chief, Alexei Sorokin, and Frank Lowy, the head of the Australian 2022 bid. It is not clear whether they actually agreed to meet with Blazer.
Peter Hargitay, an adviser to the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, was also reported to be on the list of those whose meetings with Blazer were bugged. He confirmed he did meet briefly with Blazer during the Games. Anybody who was working with Blatter was obviously of interest. Although I dont see what the hell I could contribute, he told the Guardian. All these things refer to a time when I was not involved in football.
According to the reports, Blazer also agreed to allow the FBI to monitor his communications with 44 high-ranking football officials, including Blatter.
Collins, a long-term campaigner for Fifa reform, said the fact the meetings took place on British soil was enough for the SFO to launch its own investigation and demand evidence from the scandal-plagued Zurich-based governing body. He told the Guardian: Their concern is about whether they had jurisdiction. This is proof they do have jurisdiction. There could easily be grounds for them to get involved. If they feel they have the jurisdiction they will.
A request may have to be made to the Swiss authorities but it would be astonishing if Fifa failed to respond to the SFO. It would be quite a serious breach of trust to make the SFO go to the Swiss courts.
The SFO said it had not yet received any information that showed the UK criminal courts would accept jurisdiction. A spokesman added: We continue to monitor the situation and to keep the jurisdictional position under review.
Blazer, who documented his indulgent lifestyle and boasted of his meetings with world leaders on his own blog, served on Fifas executive committee for 17 years from 1996. As the general secretary of Concacaf, he was the right-hand man to its controversial president Jack Warner.
In 2011, he helped provide evidence that implicated Warner and the prospective Fifa presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam in bribing members of the Caribbean Football Union. The Qatari Asian Football Confederation president Bin Hammam was forced to withdraw his challenge to Blatter and was later banned from football for life.
In April 2013, a Concacaf internal audit found Blazer had received $15m in hidden commissions since 1998 and had operated without a contract for that entire period. He resigned from Fifas executive committee shortly afterwards. Warner had already resigned from his all football positions a year earlier.
Among the documents published by the Daily News is a Social Security benefits summary that shows Blazer failed to declare income between at least 1992 and 1998, a period during which he received at least $21.6m in compensation from Concacaf.
The 2013 internal Concacaf audit revealed he had also claimed millions more in commissions on deals and expense and detailed a $29m credit card bill amassed by Blazer and his senior colleagues over seven years.
The newspaper report claims that Concacaf paid $18,000 a month for his Trump Towers apartment, in the same building as its offices, and a further $6,000 per month for an adjoining flat that was mostly used by his cats.
Blazer, now seriously ill with cancer, refused to comment on the claims when visited by the Daily News. Since 2011, when it first emerged that the FBI was investigating claims of tax avoidance and money laundering related to Fifa executives over the past two decades, the law enforcement agency has refused to comment.
The latest wave of claims come as the head of the adjudicatory chamber of Fifas ethics committee considers a report by former New York southern district attorney Michael Garcia into allegations of corruption during the 2018 and 2022 bidding race.
Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory chamber of Fifas ethics committee, has promised to make a statement by the middle of the month on the contents of the report but will not publish it in full. Those who have seen parts of the report claim that it contains enough evidence to implicate several individuals in wrongdoing but is unlikely to result in the hosts of either tournament being stripped of the World Cup.
Garcia spent 18 months investigating the bidding process and interviewed more than 75 witnesses. However, he could not compel any of those no longer involved in football  including Blazer, Warner, Bin Hammam and the former Brazilian football official Ricardo Teixeira  to give evidence.
Last month, he warned Fifa it needed to publish as much of the report as it could if it wanted to convince the public its culture had changed.
The 2018 World Cup was awarded to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar following a chaotic and controversial bidding race marked by allegations of collusion and corruption.
What is astonishing is that Sepp Blatter seems to regard these things as a private matter for Fifa, said Collins. If were dealing with matters of bribery and corruption, it is a matter for the criminal courts."

Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chair of the adjudicatory arm of Fifas ethics committee, received the potentially explosive 360-page report and 200,000 pages of supporting documents from Michael Garcia, the former US attorney for the southern district of New York who is head of the investigatory arm, last month.
Ever since, a battle has raged over whether and when it will be published. Garcia and several members of the Fifa executive committee have called for it to be published in full, with names redacted to protect whistleblowers, in order to help restore Fifas battered credibility.
Eckert has now moved to clarify the situation in an interview posted on Fifas website, promising to deliver a statement by mid-November at the latest but again ruling out full publication of Garcias report.
The statement will contain an overview of the investigation report, a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report, as well as a brief evaluation of the same, he said.
The German judge, appointed as part of Fifas reform process as it tried to come to terms with the fallout from a string of corruption allegations, said that because those interviewed had been promised confidentiality it would be all but impossible to publish the report in full.
Publishing the report in full would actually put the Fifa ethics committee and Fifa itself in a very difficult situation legally, he said. What is more, we have to respect the personal rights of the people mentioned in the report, which in the case of full publication of the report would in all likelihood not be possible.
Garcia reiterated his call for more transparency in a speech to US lawyers in London earlier this week but Eckert insisted there was no rift between them. He said: Michael Garcia has never said that the report should be 100% published. He merely said that the appropriate publication of his report should be authorised. The deputy chairman of the adjudicatory chamber and I now have the task of drawing up this appropriate form for publication.
Part of my current examination involves deciding what form this appropriate publication should take, whether this means issuing a statement regarding the investigation report or whether certain parts of the investigation report will be published while maintaining anonymity, or indeed a combination of these possibilities. This decision is exclusively a matter for the adjudicatory chamber  neither the investigatory chamber nor the Fifa executive committee can decide. The main requirement is that personal rights must not be damaged.
Eckert, who has been under pressure to clarify his position, said in September that his own judgment based on Garcias investigation, likely to be delivered early next year, would not go down well with many at Fifa. Many wont like what I am going to tell them, he warned.
He also attempted to deal with claims that Garcia was compromised because he was an American citizen investigating a bidding race in which the US played an integral part. The US would be in pole position to host the 2022 tournament if it was stripped from Qatar.
It must be pointed out that the main report has been produced not by Michael Garcia alone, but also by the deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee, Cornel Borbély. In fact, the report into Russia and the USA was produced solely by Cornel Borbély, said Eckert.
This is because Michael Garcia was unable to take part in some parts of the investigation due to the possibility of conflicts of interest, for example in the case of the American bid [as he is a US citizen].
Controversy has surrounded the controversial and chaotic decision to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar ever since the vote in December 2010. Mohamed Bin Hammam, the disgraced former president of the Asian Football Confederation, has been linked to paying a string of bribes during the Qataris failed bid to become Fifa president, with some linking his activities to the concurrent Qatar 2022 bid. The failed bidders, including the US, Australian and England, also come under scrutiny.
Eckert has said that only four people have access to Garcias report, but other sources claim to have seen parts of it. It is said to focus on breaches of the ethics code by several individuals but Eckert and the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, have said that only Fifas executive committee would have the power to strip either Russia or Qatar of the World Cup. Garcia travelled to all the bidding countries, except for Russia where he is barred from entry due to the countrys continuing dispute with the US over sanctions, to gather evidence over an 18-month period.
In his speech in London, Garcia called for a culture change among Fifas leadership and called for an end to the prevailing veil of secrecy at the Zurich-based governing body. The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard, he said. Thats a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny."

Michael Garcia, head of the investigatory arm of the international ruling bodys independent ethics committee, has delivered his report into the chaotic and controversial process that saw Russia and Qatar awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to its adjudicatory arm headed by Hans-Joachim Eckert.
Along with several members of the executive committee, Garcia has called for the 430-page document to be published in full. But the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, has said the decision will be left to Eckert, who has indicated that only his summary will be made public.
The issue sparked a row at Fifas executive committee meeting in Zurich last month between those members who wanted it to remain secret and those who wanted it published.
Speaking at an event in London to an audience of US lawyers, Garcia said the two key elements to restoring public trust in Fifa within football and among the public at large were transparency and the culture fostered by its leadership. The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard, he said. Thats a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny.
In a coded attack on Blatters style of leadership and the cronyism that has characterised his 16-year tenure as president, Garcia said that a wholesale culture change was required to reinforce the rule changes made in the wake of a series of corruption scandals in recent years. An ethics committee  even a serious, independent ethics committee backed by a strong code of ethics  is not a silver bullet, said Garcia, a former US attorney for the southern district of New York.What is required is leadership: leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone; leadership that wants to understand and learn from any mistakes or mis-steps the ethics committee may have identified; leadership that makes it clear to everyone  This is what weve set up the ethics committee to do, this is why they do it, and this is what theyve done, he said. Its that kind of leadership that breathes the life into a code of ethics. Because true reform doesnt come from rules or creating new committee structures. It comes from changing the culture of the organisation.
Garcia drew a distinction between the International Olympic Committees behaviour in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, which he said helped restore faith in the organisation, and the way the NFL has mishandled the Ray Rice case. The value of transparency is evident from the experiences of other sports organisations. Where there have been transparent and open proceedings those organisations have been able to move forward, he said.
Garcia said football officials could be compelled to give evidence under threat of suspension and praised the scope of his powers to launch and conduct investigations. But he admitted that without the power to seize evidence or subpoena witnesses he relied on an honours system, underlining the need for a culture change imposed from the top down. My investigations rely largely on a sort of honours system. Co-operation is required but without subpoena power, it can be difficult to assess the quality of someones compliance with a given request, he said. And yet, to the credit of many within the sport, we have received substantial co-operation in providing information and producing documents from a variety of sources.
One of the major challenges faced by Garcia during his 18-month investigation was that he was unable to compel those no longer involved in football, such as the banned former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam, to give evidence."

Michael Garcia, the former New York district attorney who is head of the investigatory arm of Fifas ethics committee, called on the executive committee to intervene and ensure the report was made public. Garcia, who sought to interview all 22 executive committee members who made the contentious decision to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar but found some who are no longer in football beyond his reach, delivered his report this month.
But Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of the ethics committee, said last week that only four people had seen Garcias initial report and that it could be next spring before he was ready to pass judgment. He has said that only his findings would be published and not Garcias report.
Eckert has also said he will only judge individuals, and leave the hosting status of Russia and Qatar to Fifa.
Garcias 350-page report is believed to recommend sanctions against several individuals involved in the chaotic and convoluted bidding process, but Fifa insiders believe there is not likely to be enough evidence to strip Qatar of the 2022 tournament.
Given the limited role Mr Hans-Joachim Eckert envisions for the Adjudicatory Chamber, I believe it is now necessary for the Fifa Executive Committee to authorise the appropriate publication of the Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 Fifa World Cup Bidding Process, said Garcia in a statement that makes clear his frustration with Eckert.
Publication would be consistent wth statements made by a number of Executive Committee members, with the view recently expressed by Independent Governance Committee Chair Mark Pieth, and with the goals of the reform process.
The Fifa vice president, Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, this week became the latest Fifa executive committee member to call for more transparency.
This will only help the football community move ahead in reforming our institutions in the best interest of the sport, he said.
The entire football family as well as its sponsors and those who follow the game worldwide have a full right to know the contents of the report in the spirit of complete openness.
US Soccer president Sunil Gulati, who also sits on Fifas executive committee, has also promised to push for greater transparency.
If were going to truly support the idea of transparency and change within Fifa, it has to be made public in the truest meaning of the word, he told the New York Times. That doesnt mean only the executive committee. It has to be more.
Others, including the British Fifa vice president Jim Boyce and Concacaf president Jeffrey Webb, have also called for the documents and evidence to be published in full.
Fifas executive committee meets later this week in Zurich. Sepp Blatter, who will stand for a fifth term as president next spring, said last week the organisation had an exemplary reputation in ethics."

While those on the Qatari organising committee have consistently stated a summer tournament is viable thanks to the development of cooling technologies to be used at grounds, sentiments their general secretary Hassan al-Thawadi reiterated on Monday, there is still widespread concern for the health of players, officials and supporters.
Zwanziger, the former president of the German football association, still sits on the Fifa executive body which, in 2010 and before his time, awarded the tournament to Qatar. He suggested the threat of legal action by anyone affected by the scorching heat may force the finals to be moved. I personally think that in the end the 2022 World Cup will not take place in Qatar, said the German, who is a long-standing critic of the decision to award the games to the Gulf state. Medics say that they cannot accept responsibility with a World Cup taking place under these conditions.
They may be able to cool the stadiums but a World Cup does not take place only there. Fans from around the world will be coming and travelling in this heat and the first life-threatening case will trigger an investigation by a state prosecutor. That is not something Fifa Exco members want to answer for.
Fifa has been quick to point out that Zwanziger, who had been speaking to Sport Bild, was expressing a personal opinion rather than reflecting the views of the governing body. As a result, it declined to comment on his specific observations.
Nasser al-Khater, Qatars executive director of communications, responded in a statement by saying: The only question now is WHEN, not IF. Summer or winter, we will be ready.
Zwanziger is due to step down from Fifa at its congress next May where he is likely to be replaced by his successor at the DFB, Wolfgang Niersbach. That would suggest Zwanziger will no longer have any involvement or influence at Fifa by the time it begins considering the findings of the investigation into alleged bribery and corruption in the award of the finals to Qatar, being led by Fifas prosecutor Michael Garcia, let alone the question of human rights abuses and the rights of migrant workers building the stadiums in the country.
Fifa continues to explore the possibility of moving the tournament to the European winter to avoid the soaring summer temperatures, which routinely rise above 40C. The president of the Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, chaired a meeting to discuss the matter earlier this month with the options of January to February 2022 and, more likely, November to December 2022 offered as alternatives to June and July.
Yet there remains opposition from domestic leagues who will inevitably be disrupted, with plenty of obstacles still to be overcome. We applied for a summers World Cup, and the cooling technology that we have suggested already exists, Thawadi said in an interview with Die Welt. For example, we have showed at the public viewing during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil that the technique works at outdoor events. It was a great success.
And our system is sustainable. It is clear a World Cup in the summer is possible but, if Fifa wants to reschedule the tournament, that is also OK with us. We will just wait but Im not afraid [of the tournament being denied Qatar]. There is no basis for us losing the World Cup. It is the first World Cup in the Middle East and will be a platform that brings people together. It will leave a positive legacy, so I am sure the finals will be held in Qatar in 2022."

Eckert set a target on Friday of the end of October, beginning of November to finish his work on the 2018 and 2022 bidding contests, won by Russia and Qatar, respectively
I understand it is urgent, Eckert told an ethics in sport conference in Zurich.
The German judge said he was very precisely reading 430 pages of investigative reports from Fifas prosecutor, Michael Garcia.
Even if Im used to reading fast, with due respect I will take some time, Eckert said through a translator.
Garcias reports detailed factual findings [and] reaches conclusions concerning further action with respect to certain individuals, Fifa said in a statement this month.
Eckert can impose sanctions against members of the Fifa executive committee who voted in the December 2010 ballots. It is unclear what action he can take or recommend against any of the nine bidding candidates.
Eckert says only four people have seen the reports  himself, Garcia, and their deputies, the Australian judge Alan Sullivan and the Swiss prosecutor Cornel Borbely.
Fifa and its administration have not got this report and that is the way it is meant to be, Eckert said. You can also rest assured that we as professionals know how to safeguard the report in order not to give anyone access to it.
He dismissed reports that people under investigation had applied pressure on him to reveal details. No one has called me, he said, suggesting that would breach the Fifa code of ethics. If that was the case, Michael Garcia would have to deal with new cases.
The ethics code also demands confidentiality, Eckert said. You cannot expect for anything to be disclosed from this report to the public, he said. There is an obligation for secrecy and we will comply with this.
Garcia was due to speak later Friday at the conference hosted by Fifa . The former US attorney and his investigators spent almost a year interviewing officials involved in the two-year bidding campaigns. The contests were dogged by allegations of bribery, voting collusion, and seeking favours.
Some voting members of the Fifa board have since left football while under investigation in other corruption cases, and refused to cooperate.
Staffers from the nine candidates, involving 11 national associations, were also interviewed, and provided documents from their bids."

He has spent more than 18 months investigating claims of ethics breaches and vote trading in the process of awarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar.

Qatar was announced as holders of the prestigious tournament in December 2010 but the decision has been plagued by allegations of corruption and bribery.
The Culture Media and Sport (CMS) select committee will also hear from Sunday Times journalists Heidi Blake and Jonathan Calvert.
The newspaper reported in June that Qatari football official Mohamed Bin Hammam made payments totalling £3million in return for support for the Qatar bid.
Qatar denies any wrongdoing and claims Bin Hammam always acted independently of the campaign.
Dyke, who was appointed FA chairman in March 2013, has been highly critical of Fifa in the past and has given his backing for a re-vote should the corruption allegations be proven.
The CMS examined allegations of corruption in 2012 and called for a full, transparent investigation.
Fifa ethics investigator Michael Garcia is finalising a report into the bidding processes for the World Cup in 2018, won by Russia, and 2022.
Garcia is expected to submit his findings at the end of July with any decision regarding a re-vote to rest with Fifas executive committee.
Prime Minister David Cameron, who was involved in Englands 2018 bid, admitted in June that he had misgivings about the campaign.
My memories of that bidding process are not happy memories in terms of the way the whole thing was arranged and the role of Fifa, Cameron said.
There is an inquiry under way, quite rightly, into what happened in terms of the World Cup bid for 2022.
We should let that inquiry take place rather than prejudge it.
Despite an unforgiving climate and a lack of suitable infrastructure, Qatar defeated bids from South Korea, Japan, Australia and the United States to win the 2022 vote.
Australia and Japan have already backed calls for the bid to be re-run.
The CMS committee will also examine the FAs role and engagement with Uefa and Fifa in the international game."

Footballs governing body informed Beckenbauer on Friday that the ban was lifted with immediate effect, Marcus Höfl said in a statement posted via his Twitter feed.
Fifa imposed the 90-day ban on 13 June at the request of the ethics prosecutor Michael Garcia. Beckenbauer said at the time he was surprised by the ban, and received the questions only in complicated legal English.
Beckenbauer then pledged to answer the questions put to him in German and in writing, and his manager said on June 18 that the Fifa ethics committee received his answers to all its questions.
Fridays statement said Beckenbauers management team continued to believe the ban was not justified because he had no obligation to testify to Fifa, but said that with hindsight it would have been better for him to answer the questions earlier.
I underestimated the matter, Beckenbauer said in the statement, adding that the main reason was such voluminous administrative things are usually dealt with by his management team, but in this case he was unable to involve it fully.
Höfls statement said, independently of the bans lifting, that Beckenbauer will not be travelling to the World Cup.
Beckenbauer was a voting member of Fifas executive committee in December 2010 when it chose Russia as 2018 World Cup host and Qatar to stage the 2022 tournament. He served on the committee from 2007-11, joining after he led Germanys organization of the 2006 World Cup.
Beckenbauer is an adviser to Fifas football committee and a global ambassador for Bayern Munich."

Garcia questioned England 2018 officials about picking up the bill for the Trinidad dinner during interviews in London last year as part of his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The dinner was part of efforts to woo the then influential Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, who has since quit football in disgrace.
Any action from Garcias report is likely to be announced within the next two months but sources close to Englands bid say their lawyers are comfortable they did not break any rules. The Football Association would not comment.
It can also be revealed that Garcia is looking into all friendly matches played by bidding nations with the countries of Fifa executive committee members before the 2010 vote.
Englands friendly against Trinidad in June 2008 is unlikely to be called into question as it took place before the bid was officially registered in 2009, even though the FA had announced some time before the match that it was bidding.
However, England 2018 did promise Thailands Fifa member an international match but pulled out of the friendly after its humiliating defeat in December 2010. Other bidding countries also staged friendlies against Fifa members countries  for example Japan played Guatemala.
Fifas bidding rules of conduct stated bidders should refrain from any benefit, opportunity, promise, remuneration, or service to any Fifa members, consultants or their families.
The £35,000 gala dinner was for 160 people from the Caribbean Football Union and took place in Port of Spain in February 2010.
It was revealed by Warner on the eve of the event, when he said: It is costing the FA about £35,000, but I think that is money well spent as it allows them to speak to all 32 countries from the CFU.
It also means I will be able to get the collective view of my membership about who they think should host the World Cup when the time comes for me to decide who I should vote for.
And in light of the harsh economic conditions we are battling in the region the FA has agreed to formally partner with us to host the dinner. It is an offer which I have agreed to.
At the time, England 2018 said the £35,000 payment would allow the CFU to spend the money they save on football projects instead.
David Dein, the former Arsenal and FA vice-chairman, addressed the gala dinner in his role as international president of the 2018 bid team.
The £35,000 is put into the shade by the £1m Qatar 2022 spent sponsoring the Confederation of African Footballs congress and Australia 2022s £300,000 on a grant to Warners Concacaf centre of excellence in Trinidad.
Franz Beckenbauer has hit back at Fifa over his 90-day ban for failing to aid the continuing investigation into corruption allegations surrounding the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and insisted he would cooperate with the inquiry.
In a statement released via his manager, Marcus Höfl, Beckenbauer said he would answer Fifas statement within the next two weeks and therefore assumed the ban, which includes his attendance at World Cup games, would be lifted with immediate effect.
But Beckenbauer also criticised Fifa for failing to inform him of its decision before going to the press. The two-times World Cup winner  once as a player, the other as manager  had been extremely surprised by hearing of his ban via the news on Friday, even though Fifas ethics rules state that any party accused of deliberate breach would be given the chance to release an advance statement.
It was the first time that Fifa did not know how to contact me by telephone, said Beckenbauer. Furthermore I always assumed that I did not have to answer the questions because I no longer hold an official function with Fifa. But that has now been cleared up.
In the statement, Höfl said Beckenbauer had at no point ruled out answering the questions put to him by Fifa."

Going on the attack, the Qatar 2022 organising committee said that the bribery claims were tactical leaks designed to interfere with the independence of an ongoing investigation by former New York attorney Michael Garcia.
Having previously insisted Mohamed bin Hammam, the disgraced Qatari former Fifa executive at the heart of the claims, had no ""official or unofficial"" role with the bid, organisers have now tried to clarify their relationship. Bin Hammam was forced out of football after it emerged he had paid bribes to win support for his bid for the Fifa presidency in April 2011. The Sunday Times has linked payments from a $5m slush fund to football officials in Africa to Qatar's bid to host the 2022 World Cup, but Qatar's supporters insist those payments were related to his presidential bid.
The Qatari organisers said that they had ""never denied we had a relationship with Mr Bin Hammam"" and that, as he was a voting Fifa executive and the Asian Football Confederation president, it was ""important for us to maintain a working relationship with him"".
""But let us be clear: Mr Bin Hammam is from Qatar, but he was not a member of Qatar's bid team,"" they said.
""None of this was improper. We hoped, of course, that Mr Bin Hammam would support our bid. But we hoped for the same from every executive committee member.""
The lengthy response is designed to pre-empt a new wave of claims in the Sunday Times expected to focus on the relationship between the organising committee and Bin Hammam in the period after the bid was won and before he was expelled.
""The constant stream of allegations that have been released to media outlets on the cusp of our interviews with the chairman of Fifa's ethics committee investigative chamber do not implicate our bid,"" it claimed. ""They are instead a series of tenuous links that attempt to assume guilt by association.""
It said the leaks were timed to coincide with important dates in the Fifa calendar, such as last week's Fifa congress in São Paulo, and were designed to undermine Garcia's investigation. Garcia has finished his investigation into the controversial 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding races and has promised to deliver his report by mid-July. He told the Fifa congress last week that he had been in possession of the source material behind the Sunday Times stories ""for some time"". But journalists at the paper believe there is more material in their cache of ""hundreds of millions"" of documents that he has yet to consider.
The head of the adjudicatory chamber of Fifa's ethics committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert, is expected to publish his final conclusions in September.
It is understood that the Qatari organising committee are preparing to fight any attempt to strip them of the World Cup in the Swiss courts, having already begun building three of the stadiums required. They admitted ""aggressively marketing"" their hugely well resourced bid but insisted they broke no rules.
The Qatar 2022 organising committee also again claimed hosting the World Cup would act as a catalyst for change in the region.
""We pledged that this tournament would be a catalyst for accelerating improvement in our nation and the region,"" said the statement.
""One example of this is our comprehensive engagement on the issues we face in regard to labour. We implemented worker welfare standards. This is spurring change and engagement."""

I guess it goes with the territory of being one of the world's most powerful media tycoons.
I mention the latest example because it appears to be gaining currency. I heard it last week from within Qatar. Today's version, which is stunningly similar, came to me from the United States.
These sources have to remain anonymous because the former was clearly speaking to me off the record. The second requested confidentiality before offering the ""evidence.""
It is built around the fact that, for the past two weeks, Murdoch's UK title, the Sunday Times, has run pages and pages of allegations about dodgy dealings involving the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
So the theory is posited on the grounds that Murdoch's wider media business interests stand to gain from attacking Qatar in the hope of Fifa changing its mind. Here goes:
Murdoch's entertainment conglomerate, 21st Century Fox, owns BSkyB and TV sports channels outside Britain. He therefore has two fears:
First, should the Qatari contest be moved, as seems likely, from summer to winter, the resulting disruption to the normal sporting calendar would cause Murdoch's outlets significant financial losses, as James Murdoch suggested last September.
A winter World Cup would conflict with a whole host of seasons (and billions of dollars of broadcast rights) for Murdoch's channels. These include BSkyB's rights to Premier League football in Britain; Fox's rights for the 2022 World Cup and Fox's rights to the US National Football League; plus the rights to the US college football season; rights to NASCAR racing; rights to South American football, the Copa Libertadores; and the Major League soccer playoffs. All of these take place in the winter.
Second, competition from the Qatari-owned beIN Sports (an Al-Jazeera networks offshoot) is a growing threat to Murdoch's interests.
BeIN already owns the broadcast rights for football leagues, including the World Cup, in the Middle East and Africa (MENA); it has rights to show the Spanish, Italian and French football league games in the US (two of which were previously held by Fox); and it has rights to broadcast select World Cup qualifiers.
In addition, beIN has the rights in France to French and German league football, Champions League and the European football championship.
It is also seeking more sporting rights in other growing markets, such as Indonesia, Hong Kong an the Philippines.and is making a major push into the north American market.
Clearly, it has a large enough cheque book to outbid many other channels, including Fox, for major broadcast rights.
There you have it - that's the theory. So what should we make of it? Well, let me begin by saying I find it hard to believe the Sunday Times is dancing to a corporate tune.
Although we don't know how its reporters obtained the millions of documents they refer to, it stretches credulity to think Murdoch, or someone acting for him, obtained them and passed them on.
It will, of course, be hugely disruptive if the Qatar World Cup is moved to the winter months, but Murdoch's company will not be the only rights holder to suffer from consequent problems.
Still, I grant that it is a theory. And, as with all such theories, proof is hard to come by. You can make up your own minds."

Visa and Adidas on Sunday joined Sony in demanding that the bribery claims be taken seriously by world football's governing body, on the day that England's footballers arrived in Brazil.
Adidas, which recently renewed its sponsorship until 2030 and is Fifa's longest serving partner, said: ""The negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners.""
Visa, which insists that only its cards can be used at World Cup venues as part of its sponsorship deal, said it expected Fifa would ""take the appropriate actions"" to respond to the current investigation and its recommendations.
On Saturday, Sony had said it expected Fifa to ensure the disclosures are ""investigated appropriately"".
A spokesman for Coca-Cola said: ""Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the Fifa World Cup is a concern to us, but we are confident that Fifa is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee.""
The sponsors spoke out following new revelations in the Sunday Times regarding the activities of Mohamed Bin Hammam, the Qatari former Fifa executive committee member  who was also formerly the Asian Football Confederation president  and his alleged links to the successful Qatar 2022 bid.
Collectively, all of Fifa's sponsors contribute $1.5bn (£900m) over a four-year World Cup cycle.
The commercial pressure will cause a new wave of concern among Fifa executives already dealing with the implications of a troubled buildup to the 2014 tournament in Brazil and a new wave of corruption allegations over the improbable award of the 2022 tournament to Qatar.
The Sunday Times reports, based on a cache of millions of documents detailing the activities of Bin Hammam in the runup to the vote in December 2010, outlined allegations that he used a $5m slush fund and his influence to pay bribes and coordinate global trade deals for the bid.
The Qatar 2022 organising committee insists that Bin Hammam, who quit football after an attempt to unseat Sepp Blatter as Fifa president was derailed by bribery allegations in 2011, had no ""official or unofficial"" role in winning the bid.
The World Cup in Brazil  which has had a troubled buildup domestically in the light of public anger over the $11bn spent on hosting it at a time of underinvestment in public services  has added another dimension to the bribery storm.
Meanwhile, amid continuing concern over the treatment of migrant workers building stadiums in Qatar, Fifa is also understood to be considering a plan to make a country's human rights record a factor in awarding future World Cups.
It is understood those responsible for drawing up the new rules are considering the plan in response to the global outcry that met reports from human rights groups and the Guardian about the conditions faced by migrant workers in the region.
Fifa delegates gathering in São Paulo before Tuesday's organisational congress insisted the current investigation by former New York attorney Michael Garcia would deal with the bribery claims.
Following a year-long investigation into how the 2018 and 2022 tournaments were won by Russia and Qatar, Garcia has promised to finish his work by Monday and hand the completed report to the adjudicatory chamber of Fifa's ethics committee by mid-July.
It emerged last week that Garcia had declined to examine the evidence obtained by the Sunday Times. Fifa sources said he had already seen the same material, but the newspaper believes he has only received a selection of the documents it has in its possession.
Blatter took to Twitter to declare that the governing body needed more time: ""Never ignoring media reports on ethics allegations in football. But let the Ethics Committee work!""
The latest body blow to Fifa's reputation overshadowed last-minute preparations for the tournament as the 32 teams and their fans continued to arrive.
After England's players touched down in Rio de Janeiro, manager Roy Hodgson shrugged off the team's goalless draw against Honduras on Saturday.
""It doesn't mean anything,"" he said. ""The team is in good shape. We are all united and anxious for the first match against Italy.""
In Sao Paulo, where the buildup has been low-key amid conflicted emotions about Fifa and World Cup organisers, preparations continued for the home team's opening match against Croatia on Thursday. Despite widespread concern that the $300m Arena de São Paulo would not be ready in the wake of delays partly caused by the deaths of three construction workers, organisers insist that the remaining work is purely cosmetic.
A São Paulo court on Sunday ruled that an ongoing Metro strike, which caused violent clashes between protesters and police on Friday evening and threatened to disrupt the opening match, was illegal. Union leaders, who had claimed they would seek support for a general strike, said they would now proceed with it.
Inside the stadium, rehearsals continued for the pre-match formalities. Outside, families queued up in the sun to have their picture taken against the backdrop of the new stadium which will be used by club side Corinthians after the tournament once temporary stands at either end have been remodelled.
However, the situation at several of the 11 other stadiums is unclear, with critics warning that those in remote parts of Brazil with no major football teams will quickly become white elephants. The much criticised decision not to base the group stages in geographic clusters has also led to logistical concerns over the huge distances that will have to be covered by players and fans."

The Sunday Times reported that it has seen documents that appear to undermine the Qatar 2022 committee's claims that Bin Hammam had no ""official or unofficial role"" in its bid.
The latest revelations have increased pressure on Fifa, football's world governing body, to take action as one of the tournament's biggest sponsors, the Japanese electronics giant Sony, called for the claims of wrongdoing during the bidding process to be ""investigated appropriately"".
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has said that if the leaked documents disclose the truth there would be an ""overwhelming case for the bidding process to be reopened immediately"". The latest revelations include the claim that Bin Hammam brokered government-level talks through the Thai member of Fifa's executive committee (Exco) to push a gas deal that was potentially worth tens of millions of dollars to Thailand.
Another allegation is that he was invited to visit Vladimir Putin to discuss ""bilateral relations"" in sport between Russia and Qatar a month before the World Cup vote took place in December 2010, which resulted in their landslide victories to stage the tournament in 2018 and 2022 respectively.
They also allege that the disgraced Qatari official arranged for Michel Platini, the Uefa football chief and an Exco member, to meet the Qatari bid committee and that he arranged discreet meetings with members of the Qatari royal family for at least seven key Exco members, including the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter. Another allegation is that Bin Hammam used secret slush funds to make payments totalling $1.7m to football officials across Asia.
An Exco meeting between Blatter, Platini and others broke up on Saturday night with further refusal to comment on the Bin Hammam allegations.
Michael Garcia, Fifa's in-house investigator, last week announced that he would cut short his investigation into corruption in the World Cup bidding process ahead of Fifa's congress in São Paulo on Tuesday without reviewing the fresh evidence.
Miliband said: ""Few people will have much confidence in the investigation being conducted by Fifa unless it takes full account of the evidence uncovered by the Sunday Times.""
He said the Fifa files contained ""startling evidence that the decision to make Qatar the host for the World Cup in 2022 may have been corrupted"".
The newspaper alleges that the files ""lay bare"" the degree to which Bin Hammam could use his connections to get key football figures to meet the emir, the crown prince and other senior royals as part of the campaign to generate support for Qatar's bid.
It states: ""The files show that Bin Hammam was fixing the meetings for members of Qatar's ruling family with football's most powerful men at the same time as using a network of secret slush funds to buy up a groundswell of support among the bosses of national football associations.""
The Qatar bid committee denies any wrongdoing."

Its a call some have been making for a while.
Even before the last cigar was puffed by Australias international bid consultants at their after-party with the 2018 winners Russia, in the luxurious Baur au Lac Hotel in Zurich in December 2010, Australia cried foul play by the Qataris.
While that narrative played well in Australia, it was laughed at by most of the other bidding nations who viewed Australias bid as just as flawed as some others. Gifts and grants to overseas football associations were common to both bids.
Both FFA and the Qatar organising committee claim that they did nothing outside of Fifa bidding guidelines. The Qataris responded to the Sunday Times reports by reiterating that view and stating that Bin Hammam had no official or unofficial role with their bid.
But if there is a revote, should Australia throw its hat in the ring again as the FFA chief executive, David Gallop, indicated might be the case?
Putting aside whether the federal and state governments have the appetite  or even capacity in the current budgetary environment of deficits as far as the eye can see  to fund another bid, let alone the billions in infrastructure costs that would go with it if successful, Australia should also be seeking five pre-conditions before committing yet more taxpayers' funding.
All 209 members of Congress should vote. Fifa has agreed this should be the case for the 2026 World Cup but it should also be applied if there is a revote for 2022. This is because it is generally considered that it would be more difficult to attempt to corrupt an outcome with 105 individual voters to achieve a majority, compared with the much smaller number of executive committee members.
The technical assessment should be a key part of the decision-making. Australia received a very good technical report in 2010; Qatar did not. But FFA also knew from early on in the bidding process that the technical assessment counted for nothing  because its trio of international consultants said so on numerous occasions.
The World Cup should leave a genuine legacy for the sport by virtue of holding the event in the host nation. But rather than bidding nations handing out development funds to executive committee members countries or their friends as a means of currying favour in the bidding process, any international legacy program should come from Fifas profits after the event.
The tournament must be a commercial success for the host nation. Fifa commissioned a report on this for the 2018 and 2022 bidders which concluded that Australia was the least commercially viable of the bidders at the time. The McKinsey analysis was disputed by the FFA chairman, Frank Lowy, but its as good a benchmark as any for decision making.
The World Cup is the cash cow that funds Fifas operations and competitions for four years, as well as their lavish ways and generous executive committee bonuses. They rake in most of the money through sponsorships, broadcast rights and other measures outlined in what is known as government guarantees. The host nation is effectively required to suspend some sovereign rights and normal revenue-raising measures  for example, GST  for the duration of the tournament; the revenue source for host nations comes from a portion of the ticket revenue that is offset by the significant costs. These guarantees so outraged the Dutch parliament during the Dutch-Belgian bid for 2018, that they published them online and refused to sanction them. It is these guarantees that are part of the unrest in Brazil as local people realise the one-way traffic in Fifas favour: that with the massive expenditure is also an imbalance in risk and uncertain rewards  other than the feel good factor.
Aside from those conditions, Gallop should be demanding reform before committing Australia to another bid, if it comes to that. If he doesnt, it suggests that lessons have not been learned by FFA. That is not surprising in light of the fact that it failed to acknowledge that the conduct of its bid carried a reputational risk for Australia.
Fifa needs reform and that starts with the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter.
Anyone who believes that Blatters much talked-about reform process will result in real change is living in fantasy land. To the extent that changes have been made, they have been to suit the status quo. Prominent governance experts such as Professor Mark Pieth, Transparency Internationals Sylvia Schenk and Alexandra Wrage have all tried to work within the Fifa system but have left in frustration that the appetite for genuine reform is non-existent. Indeed, Wrage wrote that Fifa reforms to date have done little more than polish the veneer on an outdated mens club.
As Pieth, Schenk and Wrage make clear, anyone who claims that they can effect change from within either is too naïve to understand the nature of the beast theyre involved with or has become too comfortable in the world of first class air travel, five-star hotels and the best seats in the house at any football match they wish to attend.
It is entirely within the scope of the Fifa Congress to demand such change. But while FFA, and other football associations, do nothing more than beat their chests about Fifa they are just part of the problem, not a possible solution to it. To date, there is no indication from FFA that they intend behaving any differently from 2011 when the former CEO stated it would be an empty gesture to take a values-based stance in respect of Fifa and its lack of transparency and accountability, consistent with the standards Australians expect of our governments and institutions.
The forgotten stakeholders of the game  the players and fans  want and deserve better."

Michael Garcia promised to complete his work by next week, but his decision not to examine the documents obtained by the Sunday Times could undermine faith in his investigation at a crucial time.
It is understood that Garcia has not asked for the documents, said by the newspaper to number hundreds of millions of files including emails and accounts linked to the Qatari former Fifa vice-president Mohamed bin Hammam.
Those familiar with the cache say it would be impractical for him to examine them before his new deadline, days before the 2014 tournament begins in Brazil on 12 June. Qatar has faced calls to be stripped of the 2022 World Cup in the wake of fresh allegations that Bin Hammam used a $5m (£3m) slush fund to not only buy goodwill for his tilt at the Fifa presidency but to aid the 2022 bid.
""After months of interviewing witnesses and gathering materials, we intend to complete that phase of our investigation by 9 June 2014, and to submit a report to the adjudicatory chamber approximately six weeks thereafter,"" said Garcia.
""The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process, including evidence collected from prior investigations.""
Garcia has spent more than a year and £6m travelling the world to interview those involved in the race to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and investigate allegations of bribery and corruption.
He has interviewed representatives from all nine of the bidding nations, including a summit with a Qatari delegation on Monday. His findings will inform the Fifa president Sepp Blatter's decision on whether to order a revote.
But the fact that Garcia will not properly analyse the evidence from the Sunday Times database, which will form the basis of further allegations about the Qatar bid in the weeks to come, will raise concerns that he has already formed a view.
Jim Murphy, the shadow secretary for international development, said: ""If the Garcia investigation refuses to accept the Sunday Times evidence the process will be a sham and Fifa will be forever tainted. Corruption must be tackled.""
Meanwhile, David Cameron, who was one of the so-called ""three lions"" involved in the final push in December 2010 for England's doomed £21m bid to host the 2018 World Cup, said Garcia's inquiry should be allowed to take its course.
""We will see what happens with this inquiry into the World Cup. And who knows what the chances may be for the future,"" the prime minister said.
""There is an inquiry under way, quite rightly, into what happened in terms of the World Cup bid for 2022. We should let that inquiry take place rather than prejudge it.
""My memories of that bidding process are not happy memories in terms of the way the whole thing was arranged and the role of Fifa.""
Cameron said he, David Beckham and the Duke of Cambridge were assured by numerous Fifa members of their support.
But in the end England secured only one vote among the 22 executive committee members apart from that of their own Fifa vice-president, Geoff Thompson.
He added: ""I'll always remember Beckham saying to me afterwards: 'I can cope with being lied to but I can't cope with people lying to the prime minister and the future king'.""
Two of the failed bidders for the 2022 World Cup, Australia and Japan, have joined calls for the bidding race to be rerun. Both exited in the early rounds of the voting process, with Qatar defeating the US 14-8 in the final runoff.
Yuichiro Nakajima, the head of Japan's unsuccessful bid to host the 2022 World Cup, said the allegations should be investigated by Garcia and backed calls for the bid process to be rerun. ""All of this points to the need for a major reform of how Fifa is governed,"" he said.
The chief executive of the Football Federation Australia, David Gallop, said the new revelations were a serious development and told local media his federation had been involved in interviews and the production of documents.
""It's too early to say whether that reopens the door of anything that happened a few years ago in terms of Australia's position but it's a bit of a 'watch this space' at this stage,"" he said.
""We've been heavily involved in this now for many months in terms of the investigation that Mr Garcia is carrying out. We've got people who've been involved for some time now.""
The Qatar 2022 bid committee has denied any wrongdoing and said it had nothing to hide. ""We say again that Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 bid committee.""
Mark Pieth, the chairman of Fifa's recently disbanded independent governance committee, said the vote should be rerun. He told CNN: ""What I think is that it's going to shake Fifa to the foundations, because it's the first time that an institution like Fifa has to ask itself whether it should totally rerun the decision of a host, the hosting decision, and the consequences could be massive, could be about billions of dollars.""
Meanwhile, Michel Platini, the president of the European football federation, Uefa, is discussing the possibility of leading a sit-down protest when Blatter announces his intention to stand again as Fifa's president in Brazil next week.
Platini, who is increasingly considered unlikely to challenge Blatter for the top job, may ask the heads of the 54 European FAs to remain seated when the majority of the other 155 Fifa members rise to acclaim the announcement as a means of registering disapproval at Blatter's decision to stand for a fifth term despite earlier promising to stand down."

Britain's former attorney general Lord Goldsmith, a member of an independent governance committee set up by Fifa in the wake of previous corruption scandals, said that if allegations could be proved the decision to award Qatar the right to host the 2022 tournament could not stand.
Meanwhile, Australia and Japan, whose bids to host the tournament were rejected in favour of Qatar, have joined calls for Fifa to rerun the bidding process for 2022.
The Sunday Times obtained millions of documents that it said showed that Mohamed bin Hammam, a Qatari former Fifa executive committee member, paid £3m in cash and gifts to senior football officials to help secure Qatar's bid.
The evidence has been passed to Fifa's ethics prosecutor, Michael Garcia, a former US attorney in New York, who is due to meet Qatari bid officials in Oman on Monday as part of his investigation into the bidding process. There have been reports that Garcia had no plans to interview Hamman.
Goldsmith said the revelations should be thoroughly investigated. ""After the revelations in the Sunday Times, if he [Garcia] wasn't intending to see Bin Hammam he plainly has to now,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Goldsmith added: ""If Fifa is to emerge from the scandals, and this isn't the only one  there are other issues  it has to produce a convincing and transparent answer to these allegations, particularly to these hosting decisions.
""If these allegations are shown to be true, then the hosting decision for Qatar has to be rerun  if it is proved that the decision to give Qatar the World Cup was procured by bribery and improper influence then that decision ought not to stand.""
Speaking of his committee's finding, Goldsmith said: ""What we identified as one of the issues that it needed to look at was the hosting decision in Qatar. We had seen what they [Fifa] had done in relation to it. We didn't think it was satisfactory. And that's why we insisted they look into this and Michael Garcia, former US attorney for southern district of New York, was appointed to be that investigator and that's what he's doing now.""
Yuichiro Nakajima, an executive director of Japan's unsuccessful bid to host the 2022 World Cup, said the allegations should be investigated by Garcia and backed calls for the bid process to be rerun. Speaking to Today, he called for wider reforms. ""All of this points to the need for a major reform at how Fifa is governed,"" Nakajima said.
The Australian football association has said it is ""heavily involved"" in investigating claims of corruption in Qatar's successful World Cup bid.
The chief executive of Football Federation Australia, David Gallop, told local media it had been involved in interviews and the production of documents.
""We need to get more information about what's been revealed in the last 48 hours,"" Gallop told SEN radio in Melbourne.
""But don't be under any illusion that we haven't been heavily involved in all of this for some time now. ""We've been involved in interviews, production of documents and also following carefully what's been happening away from Australia  so we've got people that have been involved for some time now.""
The Qatar 2022 bid committee said it had always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity in its successful bid to host the World Cup. It said: ""In regard to the latest allegations from The Sunday Times, we say again that Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 bid committee. As was the case with every other member of Fifa's executive committee, our bid team had to convince Mr bin Hammam of the merits of our bid.""
It said it was cooperating fully with Garcia's investigation.
Greg Dyke, the chairman of the Football Association, said Fifa should not blame the messenger by rounding on the British press as it has in the past. He described the evidence presented by the Sunday Times as ""pretty damning"".
He told the Today programme: ""A lot of people in Fifa think the British media  is somehow out to get them, whereas actually I thought this was a remarkable piece of investigative journalism.""
He added: ""It clearly has to be investigated as a matter of urgency by Fifa. If it is shown that the process was corrupt, or corrupted, then I do think there will have to be a discussion about whether you take it away from Qatar.
""It was always seen as a strange decision to give the World Cup to a country where it is so hot in the summer you can't possibly play it. The advice from Fifa's own safety group was there are real safety problems, and yet that was ignored by the people who were voting."""

While awaiting the results of a semi-independent inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 bidding races, senior football figures heading for the 2014 tournament in Brazil are understood to be considering their response if the report recommends a new vote in light of new claims based on hundreds of millions of leaked emails and documents.
The Qatari organising committee for the 2022 World Cup is to meet Fifa investigator Michael Garcia on Monday in Oman, the BBC reports.
In Britain, there was a renewed outpouring of concern from politicians and former football executives after the Sunday Times alleged that Mohamed bin Hammam, a Qatari former Fifa executive committee member, paid $5m (£3m) in cash, gifts and legal fees to senior football officials to help build a consensus of support behind the bid.
The UK government, humiliated over England's own bid for the 2018 tournament, which garnered just a single external vote, has previously said the corruption allegations are a matter for Fifa.
But the sports minister, Helen Grant, signalled a shift, saying: ""These appear to be very serious allegations. It is essential that major sporting events are awarded in an open, fair and transparent manner.""
The shadow sports minister, Clive Efford, called for a rerun of the vote, in which Qatar overcame rival bids from the US, Australia, Japan and South Korea.
""This issue calls the governance of football into question. No one will have any confidence in a Fifa investigation run by Sepp Blatter,"" he said.
""Fifa must take urgent action and reopen the bidding for the 2022 World Cup if it wants to restore its credibility.""
Writing in the Guardian, the shadow international development secretary, Jim Murphy, added: ""Fifa's rules are clear  the World Cup hosting must not be bought.""
John Whittingdale, the Tory chair of the culture media and sport select committee, said Blatter's position was ""almost untenable"" and called for a ""urgent and full transparent investigation to establish the facts"".
Fifa, gathering in São Paulo for its annual congress before a 2014 World Cup that has had a troubled buildup amid anger from Brazilians at the cost and corruption, referred inquiries to the office of Michael Garcia.
The former US attorney in New York is conducting a supposedly independent ongoing investigation into the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments.
He is expected to pass his conclusions to the adjudicatory chamber of Fifa's revamped ethics committee later this year. Meanwhile, the FBI is also conducting an ongoing investigation into payments to former Fifa officials.
Jim Boyce, the British Fifa vice-president, said he would have ""absolutely no problem"" if the ethics committee recommended a new vote in light of proven wrongdoing.
The Qatar 2022 organising committee claims that Bin Hammam, who was banned from football after bribing officials in a 2011 bid to unseat Sepp Blatter as Fifa president, had nothing to do with their bid.
The Sunday Times said it had obtained a cache of hundreds of millions of documents and emails, which detailed conversations about payments and money transfers from accounts controlled by Bin Hammam, his family and Doha-based businesses. Among many other alleged payments to mid-ranking football officials and figures including the former footballer of the year George Weah, Bin Hammam paid a total of $1.6m to the disgraced former Fifa vice-president, Jack Warner, including $450,000 before the vote. Warner has always denied any wrongdoing.
He also allegedly paid $415,000 towards the legal fees of Reynald Temarii, the Fifa vice-president banned from voting in the original election following an earlier Sunday Times investigation. The legal process helped delay Temarii's replacement on the executive committee by his deputy, reducing the number of voting members to 22 and depriving Australia, one of Qatar's rivals, of a vote.
Qatar 2022 is likely to seek to argue that Bin Hammam was acting to further his presidential ambitions rather than on behalf of the World Cup bid. In a statement on Sunday it said he played ""no official or unofficial role"" in its bid.
""We are cooperating fully with Mr Garcia's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 Fifa World Cup fairly,"" said the organisers, who are consulting lawyers.
""We vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing. The right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first Fifa World Cup.""
But the newspaper said the email trails proved Bin Hammam was in fact intimately involved with the audacious two-year campaign to bring the World Cup to the tiny oil and gas-rich Gulf state, where temperatures can top 50 degrees in June.
In November 2010, the World Football Insider website quoted the bid chairman, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, as saying Bin Hammam was the campaign's ""biggest asset"" and had been a crucial mentor for his team.
One obstacle surrounding a potential re-vote, apart from a likely legal challenge from Qatar, would be the difficulty in re-running the 2022 vote without also reopening the 2018 process. Russia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup in an ill-defined dual process riddled with controversy.
Despite promising his current term would be his last  and the ongoing travails of the organisation with which he is inextricably linked  Blatter, who last month called the choice of Qatar ""a mistake"", has vowed to stand again for the Fifa presidency in 2015.

organisation',"The Qatari construction magnate Mohamed bin Hammam was in 2011 cast out from his gilded position at the commanding heights of world football's governing body. His fall closely traces the arc of Fifa's shattered reputation, and the melting credibility of his country's 2022 World Cup project.
Now the subject of the Sunday Times's remarkably detailed allegations that he paid lavish bungs to Fifa officials while lobbying them to favour Qatar, Bin Hammam was barely known outside Fifa before the vote in Zurich that secured Qatar the World Cup.
He had from 1996 been one of the 24 suited men in the executive committee  the Exco  which runs the multibillion-pound international game from Fifa's Zurich headquarters. Like several others around that top table and the president himself, Sepp Blatter, Bin Hammam had been the focus of corruption allegations; he was accused of paying cash to African delegates while supporting Blatter's presidential candidacy in 1998, and ""acting like the head of a crime organisation"" during his campaign in 2009 to retain his Exco seat.
Yet much of that, well-documented though it was by the veteran Fifa investigative journalist Andrew Jennings and others, seemed obscure to the football public, and Bin Hammam actually presented himself as a clean-up candidate when he began his charm offensive in preparation to stand against Blatter.
True to Fifa high-rollers' existence, spent ensconced in the swishest of transport and most lavish hotels, he hosted the English media at Claridge's in 2008, where with his gleaming smile, warm manner and talk of Asian football development, he appealed to the aspiration that football can help bring a divided world together.That ideal was  still is  central to the pitch crafted by Qatar's young executive bid team, imploring Fifa to overlook the desert heat, tiny population, human rights concerns and lack of stadiums or football tradition, for the symbolism of a first World Cup in the riven Middle East. There is overwhelming disbelief now that all of Fifa's Exco members based their votes on the merits of such bids, but it is important to remember how earnestly England's Football Association spent £21m, some of it public money, lobbying for the 2018 tournament.
Fifa just about held the line for the December 2010 vote, even though two of its Exco, Reynald Temarii of Tahiti and Amos Adamu of Nigeria, had been suspended following a ""cash for votes"" undercover sting, also by the Sunday Times. In the aftermath of 2018 going to Russia and 2022 to tiny, mega-rich Qatar, complaints in Zurich were more about collusion in voting than outright corruption.
Suspicion was always there, though, with billions of pounds at stake, and nation states desperate for the votes of so few men held so little to account. It seems extraordinary now, but six months later, when Bin Hammam announced his presidential candidacy, he was given credence as a candidate for reform.
He presented himself as a new broom from the coming Asian region, who might supplant the stench of graft which trails the Blatter tenure.
""I would call for more transparency in Fifa,"" Bin Hammam said, pressing his case for support in Europe.
Then the walls of credibility  Fifa's, Bin Hammam's, several other Exco members' and therefore their World Cup votes  came tumbling down uncannily close to the presidential vote. It was Sunday 29 May 2011, with delegates from Fifa's 203 football-playing nations gathered in Zurich, that Bin Hammam suddenly announced his withdrawal. Fifa followed that by announcing he had been suspended, due to paying $1m (£600,000) to 25 delegates of the Carribean Football Union, in now infamous $40,000 wads, dished out in unmarked envelopes by his then close associate and fellow Exco time-server, Trinidad's Jack Warner.
It always seemed suspect that Bin Hammam had been exposed  by Chuck Blazer, Warner's general-secretary at the north, central American and Caribbean football confederation, Concacaf  just as he was about to stand against Blatter. That left Blatter, career master of Fifa intrigue, to coast into the presidential election three days later as the only name on the ballot paper, for whom 186 of the 203 delegates dutifully queued up to vote. Despite Bin Hammam protesting his innocence,  pleading, in the lobby of one of Zurich's plushest hotels, that he was heartbroken  the allegations stood. On appeal, the court of arbitration for sport did find in July 2012 that they did not quite have indisputable evidence that Bin Hammam provided the $1m cash, but their decision was as qualified as can be, saying their ruling was not: ""Any sort of affirmative finding of innocence  It is more likely than not that Mr Bin Hammam was the source of the monies.""
Blatter was triumphant, but the public outing of Bin Hammam and Warner seemed to irreparably breach the dam of insistent Fifa denial that it was beset with any corruption.
Warner, seething, threatened a ""tsunami"" of revelations about what really went on during his years on the Exco, thunderously leaking an email in which the Fifa general-secretary, Jerome Valcke, wrote that Qatar had ""bought the World Cup"".
Valcke hastily clarified that he meant it figuratively, that Qatar's bid team had spent hugely on legitimate marketing, not that he was alleging bribes. Warner's ""tsunami"" never arrived, a reticence the Sunday Times has linked to $1.2m it claims its cache of internal emails show Bin Hammam wired to him in July 2011.
Warner resigned from football, before, in April 2013, both he and Blazer were found by a Concacaf investigation to have committed fraud and misappropriated money, allegations they deny. The same month, court documents in Zug, Switzerland, were finally disclosed to confirm the story Jennings had long alleged, that the former Fifa president Joao Havelange and long-serving Exco members Ricardo Texeira of Brazil and Ncolas Leoz of Paraguay had pocketed millions in bribes from the marketing company ISL  with Blatter's knowledge.
Now the Sunday Times, based on a massive leak from unnamed sources in Fifa, has assembled a picture of Bin Hammam flying around the world, including on the emir of Qatar's private jet, lobbying for the Qatar 2022 bid, dishing out cash gifts and lavish hospitality, to Warner, Temarii and African football delegates who appeared depressingly keen to take it.
Of the 24 Fifa Exco members in December 2010, Temariia and Adamu were suspended; Warner, bin Hammam, Blazer, Leoz and Texeira are all now tainted by corruption allegations, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and the delegates behind other African Exco members are implicated by the Sunday Times.
Blatter himself was exonerated by Fifa because the receipt of commercial bribes was not a crime in Switzerland at the time he knew the money was paid to Havelange.
Bin Hammam has not responded to the latest revelations tying him so closely to improper, cash-greased lobbying which Qatar's official 2022 bid team has again vehemently denied is associated with them. But facades are being relentlessly stripped away, revealing inexcusable, appalling corruption, among people already privileged enough, to be custodians of the great and simple, most popular game on earth."

Fifa's ethics committee then announced Bin Hammam was suspended due to allegations he had bribed 25 Caribbean Football Union (CFU) members with $1m in total. The money, $40,000 each in unmarked envelopes, was distributed by Jack Warner, then a member of Fifa Exco.
June 2011 Jack Warner resigned from his football positions after the revelations. He threatened a ""tsunami"" of corruption revelations about Fifa, and leaked an email in which the Fifa general-secretary, Jerome Valcke, had written that Qatar ""bought the World Cup.""

Now the Sunday Times has accused him of being paid $450,000 by Bin Hammam before the 2022 World Cup vote in 2010, and a further $1.2m in 2011. Warner denied the money was to buy his vote.
October 2011 19 of the CFU officials were banned, reprimanded or warned by Fifa in October and November.
July 2012 Banned from football-related activities for life by Fifa. Decision reversed by court of arbitration for sport in July; ruled there was insufficient direct evidence linking Bin Hammam with the money, but said: ""The CAS panel is not making any sort of affirmative finding of innocence in relation to Mr Bin Hammam,"" and ""It is more likely than not that Mr Bin Hammam was the source of the monies.""
December 2012 Bin Hammam resigned from all positions in football, before a decision banning him for life. This followed the Fifa Ethics Committee investigation, chaired by Michael Garcia, finding him guilty of ""repeated violations"" of the ethics code on conflicts of interest, while AFC president and while on the Fifa Exco between 2008 and 2011."

bidding competition for the 2022 World Cup after allegations that a former top Qatari football official paid $5m (£2.98m) to win support for the nation's campaign to host the event.
Labour said Qatar should lose the 2022 World Cup and urged those involved to resign if the Fifa corruption allegations detailed in the Sunday Times were true. Clive Efford, the shadow sport minister, said the new revelations ""called the governance of football into question"".
""No one will have any confidence in a Fifa investigation run by Sepp Blatter,"" he said. ""If these allegations are true then those involved should resign.""
Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, described Fifa as a ""bit of a cesspit"" and suggested there was evidence of a ""very serious crime"" following the reports.
He told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: ""The idea of another voting session with all this money sloshing around is almost too much to bear. But on the other hand, if I can pretend to be a prosecutor again for a minute, this is evidence of a very serious crime. And the fact that the allegation is that they used dollars, US dollars, means that the justice department in Washington has jurisdiction over this  the United States of course are in the World Cup finals. If the justice department started to take an interest in this, I think Fifa would feel the heat very, very quickly.""
The Sunday Times said it had obtained millions of emails and other documents relating to alleged payments made by Mohamed bin Hammam, the then Fifa executive member for Qatar. The paper said Bin Hammam, also the former Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president, used slush funds to pay out the cash to top football officials to win a ""groundswell"" of support for Qatar's World Cup bid.
John Whittingdale, chairman of the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, called for the bidding competition to be held again and said it would be impossible for Fifa to brush aside the revelations.
""It is a further demonstration of the need for a complete change in the way that Fifa operates but also that there is now an overwhelming case that the decision as to where the World Cup should be held in 2022 should be run again,"" Whittingdale told the paper.
The sports minister, Helen Grant, said: ""These appear to be very serious allegations. It is essential that major sporting events are awarded in an open, fair and transparent manner.""
The allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which gave football's biggest tournament to the tiny desert state. The process is under investigation by Fifa's independent ethics prosecutor, Michael Garcia.
Qatar has also come under fire for its labour laws, in the wake of an international outcry over conditions for migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup, which followed a Guardian investigation into workplace abuse in the Gulf state.
Bin Hammam is no longer a committee member of world football's governing body after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed campaign for its presidency in 2011. The Sunday Times alleged that he exploited his position as an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup. Qatar defeated bids from the US, Japan, South Korea and Australia.
According to the newspaper, Bin Hammam used 10 slush funds controlled by his private company and cash handouts to make dozens of payments of up to $200,000 into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African football associations who influenced how Africa's four executive members would vote. He also allegedly hosted lavish junkets for these African officials at which he handed out almost $400,000 in cash.
Last month, Blatter said it had been a mistake to choose Qatar for the World Cup, forcing Fifa to try to limit the damage. ""Yes, it was a mistake of course, but one makes lots of mistakes in life,"" said Blatter, Fifa's president, in an interview with the Swiss broadcaster RTS. ""The technical report into Qatar said clearly it was too hot but the executive committee  with a large majority  decided all the same to play it in Qatar.""
Blatter, who is standing for another term as president in 2015, is believed to have voted for the USA to host the 2022 World Cup, while his prospective rival for the presidency, Uefa's Michel Platini, voted for Qatar and has been closely linked with the plans for the 2022 tournament.
The Fifa inspection team ranked Qatar as the only ""high-risk"" option overall, yet it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 voting members of the executive committee in December 2010. The Fifa president said it was now ""probable"" that it would be played in the winter rather than the summer due to the heat. Blatter insisted, however, that Qatar, which spent huge sums on ambassadors and development programmes, had not ""bought"" the World Cup.
Jim Boyce, Fifa vice-president, said he would be in favour of rerunning the vote if allegations that widespread corruption was involved in the bid were proved. Boyce, who was not on the executive committee of the world governing body at the time of the vote, said Garcia, would have to widen his investigation.
Boyce told Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme: ""As a member currently of the Fifa executive committee, we feel that any evidence whatsoever that people involved were bribed to do a certain vote, all that evidence should go to Michael Garcia, whom Fifa have given full authority to.
""If Garcia's report comes up and his recommendations are that wrongdoing happened for that vote for the 2022 World Cup, I certainly as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a revote.""
Anna Soubry, minister for defence personnel, welfare and veterans, said: ""Somebody somewhere has got to get a serious grip on Fifa about the way that they run these competitions.""
Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, also called for a rethink if the allegations were found to be true.
He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: ""If these allegations and the contents of the emails that the Sunday Times now has turn out to be true there can be no question about this. The thing wasn't done fairly, it wasn't done openly and it would have to be cancelled and rerun entirely. The building that is happening in Qatar should be paused and they should have a fair and open competition.""
Qatar's World Cup officials said the bid committee had ""always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity"".
The country's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said: ""Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 bid committee. As was the case with every other member of Fifa's executive committee, our bid team had to convince Mr Bin Hammam of the merits of our bid.
""We are cooperating fully with Mr Garcia's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective inquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 Fifa World Cup fairly.
""Following today's newspaper articles, we vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing. We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of Qatar's bid and our lawyers are looking into this matter. The right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first Fifa World Cup."""

The Sunday Times said it had obtained millions of emails and other documents relating to alleged payments made by Mohamed bin Hammam, the then Fifa executive member for Qatar.
It alleged that Bin Hammam, also the former Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president, used slush funds to pay out the cash to top football officials to win a ""groundswell"" of support for Qatar's World Cup bid.
Bin Hammam, who launched an abortive challenge against incumbent Fifa president Sepp Blatter, resigned from his Fifa and AFC posts in 2012, shortly before he was banned for life from football administration by the global governing body's ethics committee.
The newspaper said Bin Hammam had made payments of up to $200,000 into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African football associations, and hosted hospitality events in Africa at which he handed out further funds, to get backing for Qatar's bid.
Bin Hammam also paid $1.6m into bank accounts controlled by the Trinidadian Jack Warner, also a former vice-president of Fifa, $450,000 of which was before the vote for the World Cup, the Sunday Times said.
Warner was one of the 22 people who in 2010 decided to award Russia the 2018 World Cup and Qatar the 2022 tournament. He stood down in 2011.
Two months ago the Daily Telegraph alleged that a company owned by Hammam had paid money to Warner.
Bin Hammam did not respond to questions and his son declined to comment on his behalf, the Sunday Times said.
It quoted the Qatari committee behind the World Cup bid as denying that Bin Hammam played any secret role in its campaign, or had any knowledge of the alleged payments.
The decision to give the World Cup to Qatar, a country with little football history, provoked widespread condemnation particularly over health concerns for players forced to play in the desert nation's stifling summer heat.
Blatter said in May it was a mistake to choose Qatar because of the climate."

The report also warned that Fifa's reputation wrested on resolving outstanding allegations about the vote to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar and said the reform process risked being hijacked by ""vested interests"".
The independent governance committee, overseen by professor Mark Pieth, was set up by the Fifa president Sepp Blatter in 2011 as part of his ""road map"" for reforming the organisation in the wake of an avalanche of corruption allegations.
In its final report, Pieth gave Fifa some credit for introducing a new independent ethics committee, divided into an investigatory and adjudicatory chamber.
The former is headed by Michael Garcia, the former US attorney for the southern district of New York who was appointed in 2012 and is investigating the chaotic and controversial bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
It listed seven recommendations, including a central integrity check for all executive committee members and the introduction of term limits, that had not been implemented despite Blatter recently claiming that his reform process was close to a conclusion.
""If Fifa is to emerge from the scandals of recent years, it must now produce a convincing and transparent answer to any issues relating to hosting decisions, either to confirm that the suspicions are, sadly, well founded or demonstrate that they are groundless,"" said Pieth.
""The ethics committee should not rest until there is a conclusive answer,"" he said in the report to the executive committee members, some of whom last month attempted to have Garcia removed from the case.
""And, if allegations are confirmed Fifa must ensure the consequences are meaningful.""
Pieth was also critical of Uefa for blocking a move to introduce term limits at Fifa's 2013 Congress and insisting that the so-called ""integrity checks"" should be carried out at confederation level rather than by Fifa.
""This was a signal to the IGC that the reform agenda was likely to be hijacked by rival interest groups within the organisation, supported by those in fear of losing their long-time privileges and well functioning networks.""
Almost half of the 22 voting members of the executive committee who took part in the controversial vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups have since stood down from the executive committee, many of them under a cloud of corruption allegations.
The work of the IGC has also not been without controversy. Transparency International, which was initially engaged with the reform process, quit early on when it said it had become clear that Fifa was not serious about fundamental change.
The governance expert Alexandra Wrage then quit the IGC in frustration at Fifa's unwillingness to implement some of its proposals.
""The independent governance committee put in a tremendous amount of work and effort putting together some fairly uncontroversial recommendations which were then knocked back,"" said Wrage, who is president of the non-profit international anti-bribery group Trace, at the time.
The proposals over term limits are likely to be aired again at Fifa's 2014 Congress in São Paulo ahead of the World Cup. Blatter himself is likely to stand for another four year term as president in 2015, despite previously insisting his current term would be his last."

Michael Garcia, who heads the investigatory chamber of Fifa's ethics committee, has been charged with examining the chaotic dual bidding race for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively, in December 2010.
The US lawyer turned up unannounced in Zurich last week to speak to those members of the executive committee who were around during the controversial process, which was mired in allegations of bribery and vote swapping. Some were believed to be unsettled by his presence and it has now emerged that informal conversations took place among some unnamed executives on the fringes of the meeting in an attempt to remove Garcia from his position.
The Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce, Britain's representative on the 24-person executive committee, told the Guardian he was aware of the plot but said it never made it as far as the executive-committee boardroom.
He said he would have been appalled if the plan had been raised officially and would have had to consider his position if anyone moved to unseat Garcia or interfere with his independent investigation. ""It is something that did go on but I don't know who was involved. There was a bit of informal chit-chat,"" he said.
In a statement, Boyce added: ""As someone who has been brought up with honesty and integrity  and it was a great honour for me to be asked to be a vice-president  if this had been proposed at the exco meeting or I thought for one moment Garcia would be removed in any fashion from carrying out his full investigation, I and others would be aghast and would have had to consider our positions because things at Fifa have been improving greatly.""
It is believed that some of those executive-committee members who have joined Fifa's top table since December 2010 intervened to protest strongly that it would cast the organisation in an even worse light if Garcia was blocked in any way.
There is no suggestion that the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, who last week refused to comment on fresh allegations of illicit payments between the former Fifa executives Mohamed bin Hammam and Jack Warner after the World Cup vote, was involved in the discussions regarding Garcia.
Any move to remove Garcia or abolish the reformed dual-chamber ethics committee, introduced in the wake of the storm of protest that accompanied the sullied 2011 Fifa presidential election, would have been unconstitutional in any case.
Having been created by the full Fifa congress, which will next meet in São Paulo on the eve of the World Cup, it is not within the executive committee's power to interfere with the supposedly independent ethics committee.
The Fifa executive committee member Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan told Reuters: ""I am very happy that Michael Garcia will continue in his work. There were some questions raised about the necessity of having an independent ethics committee but, to be honest, I think that idea was stopped. ""There were certain people like myself who could not accept that this could happen. He was supported by our congress and given a mandate and I am very happy he will continue with his work.""
The new ethics committee was approved by the congress in June 2011 while Garcia himself was appointed in June 2012 at an extraordinary executive committee meeting.
Garcia, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, was empowered by Congress to ""leave no stone unturned"" in his quest to discover if there had been any wrong-doing regarding the voting procedures in the World Cup bidding process. He has already toured the various bidding nations, including England, to interview all of those involved in the bid process and gather evidence.
As Fifa's first independent ethics investigator and prosecutor, Garcia was also empowered to investigate the votes-for-cash scandal that led to the long-serving and high-ranking Fifa officials Warner and Bin Hammam leaving the organisation.
Warner resigned under a cloud and Bin Hammam was banned for football for life after they were implicated in paying cash bribes of $40,000 to Caribbean Football Union members during the Qatari's unsuccessful bid to unseat Blatter as Fifa president."

The members were unaware that US attorney Michael Garcia would be in Zurich waiting to interview them before the executive committee meeting this week.
It is understood Garcia has completed the interviews  only 12 of the 22 members who took part in the vote in December 2010, plus Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, are still in office.
Garcia, the head of the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee, met some members including Uefa president Michel Platini on Wednesday and other members on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Jérôme Champagne, who announced earlier this year that he wants to stand for the Fifa presidency next year, said Garcia's investigation held the key to the reputation of the World Cup.
Champagne said: ""The process must go to the end. The World Cup must be unimpeachable, it must be untainted and it must be incorruptible.
""My position is the process led by Mr Michael Garcia must be completed and we should know what he has learned  we are talking about political influence, about collusion, about votes.""
Garcia's interviews are not thought to be connected with a report this week that the FBI is investigating payments from a company owned by a Qatari, Mohamed Bin Hammam, to fellow former Fifa member Jack Warner and his family. Both men left Fifa in disgrace following a 2011 corruption scandal.
Garcia has already interviewed officials who worked on a number of the bid teams, including England's unsuccessful 2018 campaign. It is unclear whether he has contacted the countries that won the bids  Russia and Qatar  yet.
A statement from Garcia's office said: ""As with any investigation, the ethics committee does not comment on ongoing proceedings."""

Last September, Garcia said his probe into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would see investigators interview representatives of every bid team and interviews have already taken place with a number of officials who worked on England's unsuccessful 2018 bid.
Sources connected to the world governing body say Garcia is now expected to interview those 12 executive committee members who are still in office.
It comes after a report that the FBI is investigating payments from a company owned by Qatari Mohamed Bin Hammam to fellow former Fifa member Jack Warner and his family. Both men left Fifa in disgrace following a 2011 corruption scandal.
The former head of Australia's unsuccessful bid for the 2022 tournament said he hoped the investigation would come up with ""the right answers"".
Frank Lowy said he still hoped Fifa would refund the £25m of public money spent on the Australian bid if Fifa moves the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the winter.
Lowy said: ""It is generally known that the process was not exactly a good one, to say the least.
""I've read the papers and while I would not use the word 'corruption', I think the process wasn't quite clear to everybody and the jury is still out.
""It was not a level playing field and I said at the time that we had not heard the last word about the process.
""I still don't think it is going to go away. These stories are coming up from time to time and until Fifa makes the final decision it will regurgitate each time.""
In terms of a winter World Cup, Lowy added: ""I feel if Fifa changes the date, then I think they hope to refund the people that bid on a certain time [in the summer]. Whether we get the money back or not is hard to say, but I certainly put the claim in.""
Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee said its bid committee strictly adhered to Fifa's bidding regulations."

But my favourite nugget is the revelation that at least one bank in the Cayman Islands actually refused to process a payment from Mohamed bin Hammam's firm to Warner or his sons on the basis that it looked too dodgy.
To repeat: too questionable for an offshore bank in one of the world's most notorious secrecy jurisdictions.
That Warner, a former Fifa vice-president, might have inadvertently found a single drop of quasi-morality in what is widely perceived to be an ocean of the other is a testament to his enduring ability to pull things out of the bag, even as he is serially accused of stuffing wads of the green stuff into it. In the end, some obliging souls in a New York bank apparently processed the payment, and the Daily Telegraph's investigation reveals that it was this transaction which has prompted the FBI to make inquiries.
Well, without wishing to speculate unduly on the outcome of the bureau's investigation, we must consider that it might prove living testament to the much-quoted Sherlock Holmes dictum: once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. So however wildly improbable it may seem, perhaps we will have to accept eventually that Qatar  an unimaginably rich non-democracy with zero footballing heritage and a track record of corruption where any tournament would realistically have to be played in the winter  did not in fact win the right to host the World Cup by entirely fair means.
The big question that follows, then, is to wonder what on earth can be done about the mushrooming fiasco that is Qatar 2022, only eight long years out from the World Cup.
There is a scene in an Austin Powers film which pokes fun at the movie trope of someone not being able to get out of the way of advancing death. A security guard simply waves his arms and screams ""Noooooooooo!"" in horror as an incredibly slow-moving steamroller trundles towards him, and eventually  a full 15 seconds of squandered getting-away time later  fatally runs him over.
Whenever I think of the Qatar World Cup, this is the metaphor that comes to mind. Hundred of workers have died just in the construction of the tournament infrastructure thus far; new allegations of corruption attach themselves to the vote with each passing month; the searing 50C summer heat is almost inevitably going to force the unprecedented step of moving the World Cup to winter  yet still the 2022 event is treated by Fifa as a sort of tragic inevitability.
What would actually have to happen for Fifa to consider removing the tournament from the rapidly oxidising hosts, or at the very least agreeing to a rerun of the ballot that so preposterously awarded Qatar the prize? The obvious answer is something like thermonuclear war in the emirate  but then, is that really the absolute kibosh on Qatar 2022 we might initially assume it to be? You honestly wouldn't put it past Fifa to insist that the sides play on in specially developed anti-radiation kit, even as the governing body delivers pious speeches highlighting the game's responsibility to bringing about world peace.
Were such obvious skulduggery to have taken place under British jurisdiction, we would be embarking about now on a series of long-term investigations and 30-year inquiries that would eventually tell us what we all knew happened anyway. But Fifa is a lawlessness unto itself, and with a mere eight years  eight years!  until the desert folly steamrollers over us, we seem to have long entered the phase in which Zurich conveniently judges its hands to be tied.
For the rest of us, clearly, the challenge is to accept that this is what Sepp Blatter's endlessly blathered ""football family"" looks like: a clan slightly more dysfunctional than the provisional wing of the Munsters. Blood is always thicker than water, but blood money is thicker still.
Just March, and football's award season is really kicking into action. It seems funny that the game spent so long without participants being able to be meritocratically pitted against one another  except every time they played it, of course  and we should feel especially grateful to live in a time of ever-proliferating gala nights set to redress this balance.
The big one is supposed to be the inaugural Footies, slated to take place in May, with James Corden predictably hosting. In the meantime, last Sunday night brought the Football League Awards, which boasted an enticingly expanded array of gongs. These included one for Best Digital Content and Audience Growth  which was won by Derby County for their Return of the Mac campaign around the appointment of Steve McClaren.
According to the club's website: ""Derby employed a strategy to encourage fans back to the new management team."" ""Before Return of the Mac,"" explained the winners, ""we looked at how we could drive that exclusivity we could offer with the new manager and took ownership of that which meant that we were the first place fans came to.""
Nope, me neither. Still, a most exciting new trophy for the calendar, and we must very much hope it is recognised with a nomination in the Best New Award category at next year's inevitable Football Awards Awards."

In 2009 Bin Hammam said: ""I honestly think that Fifa is a very clean organisation."" Warner has consistently denied corruption. ""I have no interest in joining in the foolishness that is now passing as news on Qatar and Jack Warner,"" he said . It might be funny if it wasn't so serious.
Warner, whose name became a byword for the anarchic gangsterism of world football's governing body over almost three decades, is said to have pocketed $1.2m (£725,000) from Bin Hammam, the Qatari former Asian Football Confedaration chief who once bankrolled Sepp Blatter's presidential campaign but was banned for life when he was caught paying bribes in a bid to unseat him.
In a familiar refrain Blatter, the great survivor who is revving up to stand for another term as president at the age of 78 despite having previously promised to stand down, will claim all this is ancient history.
Half of the 22 members of the Fifa executive committee who in December 2010 plumped for Russia and Qatar have since left the stage, some with corruption allegations trailing behind them. That will be held up as proof Blatter has cleaned the stables. Others would argue it makes their decision discredited and invalid.
Many, many questions remain. Of those that will gather around the boardroom table in Fifa's $100m lair in Zurich on Thursday, several committee members have wider links to the Qatar ""project"". Michel Platini's are well documented, including a meeting in which Nicolas Sarkozy lobbied him to vote for the Gulf state  which he did. Marios Lefkaritis, the Cypriot executive committee member, has yet to answer detailed allegations about a £27m oil and land deal with Qatari interests.
It is the timing of the Bin Hammam payments alleged by the Daily Telegraph, with a further $1m promised to Warner's two sons and an employee, that should worry Blatter and the Qatar 2022 bid committee. The request is said to have been sent just two weeks after the vote to award the tournaments to Russia and Qatar.
However, the payments were reportedly not transferred until July 2011. By that time, the Fifa presidential candidate Bin Hammam had been suspended over allegations that cash bribes were handed out to the Carribean Football Union, paid by the Qatari and overseen by Warner.
In short, the payment of $2.2m could have been for any number of services rendered. Incredibly, nor is that sum even considered anywhere near enough to buy a vote.
Warner plundered the Fifa cash register for longer than most during almost three decades at Fifa, as detailed down the years by Andrew Jennings and others. During the 2018/2022 bid race he is alleged to have taken money and favours from where ever they came, before apparently voting for the US in any case.
For Blatter and the Qataris battling on a number of fronts to keep the wheels on their listing World Cup bandwagon, the latest allegations are hugely damaging as much for what they signify as what they contain. They suggest that there is a paper trail of cash payments. Where these documents lead, others will follow.
Michael Garcia, the former investigator probing the bidding process for Fifa's ethics committee, and the FBI themselves retain an interest. If Blatter thinks he is out of the woods he might look to disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong, brought down long after the event by federal agents able to ask questions under oath, and think again.
In truth there is not likely to be any single smoking gun. The days of cash in envelopes under doors may not be entirely gone but the truth is almost certainly more complex.
The Qatari bid vehicle was one thing  a lavish orgy of spending far beyond the parameters of anything envisaged by the ill-defined bidding rules. Overseen by savvy, engaging Qataris and international consultantsit provided an attractive wrapping for quite another  the real business of geopolitical manoeuvring and global trade deals.
The extent to which executive committee members may have benefited personally is slowly becoming clear, but not through anything as straightforward as a single payment for a vote.
Throughout, Bin Hammam had an intriguing role  as a Qatari and the third most powerful man in football, he was of the bid but not officially in it. It was his responsibility to cut deals with his fellow voters on the executive committee. Yet, perhaps by design, there remained a Chinese wall between his activities and those of the bid team.
Nor is this to absolve Qatar's rivals  there are similarly cloudy allegations surrounding several others. But the hard truth for the Qataris is that they won this flawed race, so they must deal with the fallout.
Added to the scandalous toll of migrant workers dying in their hundreds to provide the inftrastructure for Qatar's grand plans and the still to be resolved questions around when the World Cup will actually be played given the searing summer heat, the likelihood of a series of new allegations surrounding the bidding process is a reminder that their problems may be only just beginning.
For Blatter, preparing to run again for a presidency he promised to renounce, it is a reminder that the millstone of a system of patronage and backhanders that flourished under his leadership will continue to weigh heavy around his neck."

The FBI is investigating payments from a company owned by the Qatari Mohammed bin Hammam to Warner and his family, according to the Daily Telegraph. Both men left Fifa in disgrace following a 2011 corruption scandal. 2022 World Cup chiefs have reacted to the latest claims by insisting they adhered to all Fifa's rules.
Warner himself, currently a politician in Trinidad, said: ""I have no interest in joining in the foolishness that is now passing as news on Qatar and Jack Warner.
""Nor do I intend to join those who are on a witch hunt against the World Cup 2022 venue. And do consider this as my final comment on this matter.""
Warner and Bin Hammam's Fifa careers ended in disgrace after they were caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding Bin Hammam's campaign for the presidency of the world governing body in 2011.
Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee said in a statement: ""The 2022 bid committee strictly adhered to Fifa's bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics.
""The supreme committee for delivery and legacy and the individuals involved in the 2022 bid committee are unaware of any allegations surrounding business dealings between private individuals.""
But a Conservative MP who is campaigning for reform of the world governing body said Fifa should rerun the bid for the 2022 World Cup if an FBI investigation proves corrupt payments were made in connection with the vote.
Damian Collins, who used parliamentary privilege in 2011 to state allegations that two Fifa members had been paid to vote for Qatar 2022, said: ""If the FBI investigation can prove that corrupt payments were made to Fifa executives in connection to the decision to award that country the World Cup, they should lose the right to host the tournament and the competition to stage World Cup 2022 should be rerun.
""These reports will only fuel concerns that the decision to award Qatar the World Cup was made for money reasons, not sporting ones, and that's wrong.
""The report on the FBI investigation suggests a web of lies and corruption at the highest levels of Fifa. This is something Fifa has never fully investigated and if these allegations are proven, there has to be a top-to-bottom review of the roles and workings of members of Fifa's executive committee."""

The controversial Trinidadian former Fifa executive committee member Jack Warner received $1.2m (£720,000) from a company controlled by former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam in July 2011, according to the Daily Telegraph.
The newspaper also alleged that a note from one of Warner's companies, Jamad, to Bin Hammam's firm, Kemco, requested $1.2m in payment for work carried out between 2005 and 2010.
It was also claimed that Warner's two sons and an employee were paid a further $1m by the same Qatari company.
One document referred to in the article was said to have stated that payments were to ""offset legal and other expenses"", but a separate letter claimed that more than $1m covered ""professional services provided over the period 2005-2010"".
The payment was allegedly requested a fortnight after Fifa's 22-man executive committee voted to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar in December 2010.
Last March it emerged that the FBI was investigating a series of corruption claims surrounding world football's governing body and that Warner's Miami-based son, Daryan, had agreed to be a co-operating witness.
According to the allegations in the Telegraph, payments totalling at least $750,000 were made to Warner's sons and a further $400,000 was paid to one of his employees.
Bin Hammam was the most senior Qatari football official inside Fifa at the time of the flawed bidding race to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments.
He was later banned from football for life after evidence emerged that he had bribed senior officials at the Caribbean Football Union at the height of a bitter battle for the presidency with the incumbent, Sepp Blatter. That ban was annulled by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), but he was later banned again over ""conflicts of interest"" while president of the Asian Football Confederation.
On Monday night, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy attempted to distance itself from corruption allegations relating to Bin Hammam, whose lifetime football ban was reiterated by Fifa in December 2012.
It said: ""The 2022 Bid Committee strictly adhered to Fifa's bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics.
""The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy and the individuals involved in the 2022 Bid Committee are unaware of any allegations surrounding business dealings between private individuals.""
The Qatar 2022 organising committee has repeatedly denied any involvement in corruption during the chaotic and ill-defined World Cup bidding race, and sought to distance itself from Bin Hammam.
More than half of the 22 men who voted to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 edition to Qatar are no longer members of the executive committee. Several have been implicated in corruption allegations.
Warner was later found by a detailed Concacaf investigation to have committed fraud and misappropriated football money.
Warner, who claimed the Concacaf report was ""baseless and malicious"", resigned from football for life in June 2012, a move that Fifa said put him beyond its jurisdiction.
For most of his 28 years as a member of the Fifa executive committee, Warner was surrounded by controversy.
In 2006, he was accused of selling World Cup tickets for three times their value and in 2010 a BBC Panorama programme alleged that he was involved in re-selling tickets for the 2010 tournament.
In 2011, he was claimed to have urged members of the CFU to accept ""gifts"" of $40,000 in cash from Bin Hammam and vote for him in the upcoming presidential election.
Bin Hammam was found by the court of arbitration for sport to ""more likely than not"" have brought cash to two meetings in May 2011 which was then handed to Fifa delegates. He has denied wrongdoing.
Controversy has continued to surround the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a country in which temperatures regularly top 40C during the summer months.
In addition to the ongoing debate about whether the tournament should be moved to the winter in order to avoid health risks for players, in-depth reports from human rights organisations and the Guardian have raised serious questions over the rights of migrant workers in the country.
More than 380 Nepalese workers and more than 500 Indian migrants have died in Qatar in the past two years, amid an unprecedented construction boom to prepare the country for the tournament and position it for the future.
Blatter, who has strongly hinted he will stand for re-election in April next year, and the Fifa executive committee will meet later this week with the Qatar World Cup again expected to be high on the agenda."

The ethics investigator Michael Garcia is conducting an investigation into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, leading to some speculation that Qatar's hosting of the 2022 event could be under threat.
Qatar insists it followed all the bidding rules but even if wrongdoing is uncovered by Garcia, the ethics committee can only sanction individuals  it has no power over Fifa's decisions.
The Fifa source said: ""If Garcia finds something which was wrong, the ethics committee has the right to take sanctions.
""But does he have the right to say: 'based on what I have found the World Cup should not be played in Qatar?' No, he does not have that right.""
Only Fifa's executive committee, the 25-strong board headed by the president Sepp Blatter which originally chose Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments respectively, can make such a decision.
Fifa's auditor, Domenico Scala, raised the question of the World Cup decision earlier this year, telling a Swiss newspaper: ""Should Qatar demonstrably be seen to have paid bribes in the run-up to the World Cup award then it could possibly be voided. Then the [bidding] process should be repeated.""
Fifa made it clear last month that the 2022 World Cup would be played in Qatar but that it would look at moving the tournament to the winter to avoid the extreme heat of the summer.
Blatter visited Qatar last week where he raised the issue of conditions for migrant workers following an investigation that highlighted appalling treatment by some employers.
After meeting the Emir of Qatar, he said he had ""reconfirmed to the Emir"" that the tournament will be played in Qatar and would not be in January to avoid any clash with the winter Olympics."

Harold Mayne-Nicholls led the inspection team that delivered reports on each of the nine bidders before the December 2010 vote. It ranked Qatar as the only high-risk option overall, yet it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 voting executive committee members in the final round of voting for the 2022 tournament.
The Chilean, who is now a consultant and academic, said that a longlist of potential hosts should be whittled down according to technical criteria before being voted on by Fifa. He pointed to the example of the IOC, which has twice rejected bids from Doha at the shortlisting stage over scheduling and climate concerns.
Fifa last week decided to set up a working party to look into moving the timing of the World Cup to either January or November 2022 to avoid the searing summer heat.
""You need something like the IOC. You need a group of three or four. Then you take the political decision. The IOC said to Doha on two occasions that you are not ready yet,"" said Mayne-Nicholls., who will speak on Wednesday at the Leader's in Football conference in London.
""The operational considerations are one thing, but we need more. We need a party for the world. You can't ask the countries to fulfil a lot of obligations. We need to think about this."" He said that Fifa should have been quicker in tackling practical concerns about the summer temperatures in June but now that it had decided to put off a decision until as late as 2015, it should use the time to conduct proper scientific tests at various points in the calendar.
Fifa has proposed that, in future, its 209 members should each have an individual vote on the World Cup host rather than it being left to the executive committee. Both secretary general Jérôme Valcke and president Sepp Blatter have also admitted that deciding on two hosts at the same time was a mistake.
Mayne-Nicholls said the selection of Qatar did not come as a surprise, despite it being ranked as the most risky of the potential hosts. Qatar's rivals for the 2022 tournament included the US, Australia, Japan and South Korea.
""I knew two days before that Qatar was really, really strong. For sure, the report was not a key element in the decision for a lot of them. They were supposed to read it, that's their job."""

Anson, who is the chief executive of the online sports retailer Kitbag, said he had requested further clarity about the aims and remit of the inquiry before agreeing to meet with Michael Garcia, the former Interpol vice-president who is the head of the investigatory arm of Fifa's ethics committee.
Other potential witnesses contacted by Garcia are understood to share concerns about the length of time that has elapsed between the December 2010 vote and the investigation taking place and the lack of clarity surrounding his remit.
It is understood that Garcia wrote last week to the Football Association's head of international relations, Jane Bateman, who was head of campaign operations during the ill fated bid, to request a meeting with the key figures in England's team when he visits London next week.
Garcia, who will tour all nine of the countries that took part in the controversial and convoluted dual bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to gather evidence as he investigates a range of corruption allegations, is expected to visit Wembley on 9 October.
He is expected to meet with the FA general secretary Alex Horne, who was not part of the 2018 bid team but was at the FA at the time. He has also contacted Lord Triesman, the former chair of the FA and the England 2018 bid who was forced to quit seven months before the vote following a newspaper sting. England's bid cost £21m but won only two votes.
Triesman later made a series of allegations to a parliamentary select committee about the bidding process.
However, some of those who have been contacted are understood to harbour reservations about Garcia's approach. They believe the letter requesting assistance was too vague and remain unclear what he is trying to achieve two and a half years on from the chaotic vote to hand the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar.
Garcia, who is said to be encouraged by the headway he has made in investigating a bidding process that became mired in allegations of corruption and collusion, hopes to report by next March or April. He has repeatedly asserted his independence from Fifa's executive but some remain sceptical about how far reaching his investigation can be given that he has no power to compel witnesses to give evidence.
The associations of the bidding nations are compelled to assist Fifa's investigation under their own rules. The other losing bidders for the 2018 tournament were Belgium/the Netherlands and Portugal/Spain. Australia, South Korea, Japan and the US lost out to Qatar for 2022.At Fifa's Congress in May, Garcia called for anyone with evidence of malpractice during the bidding process to come forward now.
""I've gone on the record before to say that I was referred a story by a London paper. I will be looking at some of the processes, but if there is any information out there, now is the time to give it to me,"" he said.
""In the course of any investigation, I am bound by confidentiality. I clearly cannot divulge information from an ongoing proceeding, as I also want to protect anyone who would wish to come to me in good faith."""

According to France Football magazine, which will on Tuesday publish the latest in a series of in-depth investigations into the awarding of the 2022 tournament to Qatar and the ongoing fallout, Garcia's tour will begin in London on 9 October.
Garcia, who has stressed his independence from the Fifa executive, has confirmed he will conduct interviews with those involved in a race that was ultimately won by Russia for 2018 and Qatar for 2022, but refused to comment on the specifics. The process of gathering new witness statements will be seen as a major escalation in an investigation that some senior figures within world football believe could yet lead to a re-vote for the 2022 World Cup. Garcia is expected to deliver his conclusions by March or April.
Fifa's president Sepp Blatter last month admitted for the first time that there was ""direct political influence"" on the members of the Fifa executive committee who made the decision to vote for Qatar and conceded a vote-swapping pact existed between Spain and Qatar.
Others, however, are equally insistent that while Qatar may have spent unprecedented sums to promote its bid and used its political and economic influence to garner votes, there is no smoking gun and they did not break any of Fifa's rules on campaigning.
Among those Garcia is likely to seek out are the executives involved in England's bid for the 2018 World Cup, which cost the Football Association £21m but garnered only two votes. The other losing bidders for the 2018 tournament were Belgium/the Netherlands and Portugal/Spain. Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US lost out to Qatar for 2022.
The former New York attorney and Interpol vice-president has no powers to compel those involved in the bidding process to speak to him but is said to be encouraged by the information he has received so far as he gathers evidence.
Fifa's executive committee will vote on Friday on whether to agree in principle to a controversial motion to move the Qatar World Cup to winter, which has provoked a furious backlash from some professional leagues, including the Premier League, as well as broadcasters and losing bidders.
Australia's bid leader Frank Lowy has already said that he will press for Fifa to compensate the country for the £25m in public money that was spent on the bid, while Fox and NBC have already held meetings with Fifa to signal their opposition to a switch to winter that would clash with the NFL season.
The International Olympic Committee is also keeping a watching brief and is keen to ensure that any switch to winter would involve playing matches in November and December 2022 and not January and February, which would clash with the Winter Olympics of that year.
Fifa's executive committee meeting will now also discuss the issue of mistreatment of migrant workers in Qatar amid a huge construction boom as the country prepares the infrastructure to host the 2022 World Cup.
A Guardian investigation last week revealed that dozens of migrant workers had died in recent weeks alone, forcing Fifa to add the topic to its agenda.
The sports minister Hugh Robertson has called the fiasco surrounding the Qatar 2022 tournament ""a mess of Fifa's own making"". He added: ""I don't think anybody in the world of football thinks a World Cup in Qatar in the summer is a sensible or deliverable option.""
But Robertson said he did not blame the Qataris for bidding to take the competition to the Middle East for the first time. ""I don't blame the Qataris at all  they wanted the World Cup and every country is entitled to have that ambition and they entered the bidding competition in the way suggested by Fifa. I entirely blame Fifa,"" he said."

In an interview with France Football magazine that follows several weeks of revelations about Qatar's victory in the race to host the 2022 World Cup Michael Garcia said he would deliver a preliminary report by 20 March, when the Fifa executive committee is due to meet next.
""I've got to look into the dismissal of the criminal investigation on Fifa, and make a report,"" he said. ""I've got to examine it like I would examine whatever else might raise the question: 'Have there been violations in the conduct of these people?' I've got to follow normal procedure and present this report to Judge Eckert, who's the president of the adjudication chamber; he'll read my report and take his decisions.
""I'll follow procedure, obviously informing the executive committee of what I'm doing. A timetable has been established. There's a meeting of the executive committee on 20 and 21 March. My goal is to have at least sent a preliminary report [between now and then]. There are many other matters under investigation, the one on the [votes for the 2018 and 2022] World Cup, which has been referred to me formally.""
A Swiss prosecutor said in a legal document released last year that Blatter's predecessor, João Havelange, and the former Fifa executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira took multimillion-dollar bribes on World Cup deals in the 1990s from the now defunct rights agency ISL.
Blatter, whose own role in the ISL scandal has long been under scrutiny, has claimed he knew nothing about the bribes until after the company went bust in 2001.
Garcia also called for evidence on the swirl of allegations surrounding the opaque bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, controversially won by Russia and Qatar. He called for witnesses to come forward and promised to protect their identities if necessary.
""The time has come for people who have information to come to me. I haven't got any preconceived ideas on what's happened or what's not happened. Well [I'm saying to them]: 'If you truly believe it, the moment has come to show yourself. There are things that we can do, under the parameters of the code, that will protect your anonymity.' I will work with them under this report. What wouldn't be  useful would be that under this wide-ranging inquiry that I'm leading, later, there are people in it who say, 'Well, they got the facts wrong', when they knew that beforehand,"" Garcia told France Football.
""You know something? Tell me! I'm working, working hard to uncover what's there or isn't there. [We've got] the framework, the channels through which people have got to come if they really think they have something to say. On whatever it might be! On whichever aspect of whichever question related to the World Cup. It is a message that has got to be heard. People have talked, written articles but what you have now is an official body which is in charge of this matter and it's important that people go see me to tell me what they've got [at their disposal].""
Garcia said it was ""too early to say"" whether he would be able to deliver any conclusions in time for the Fifa Congress, which begins on 31 May in Mauritius.
But he vowed to make his conclusions public and said: ""I will pay attention to everything, to whatever current opinion might be, and I will examine all the information with the same impartiality, whether it comes from the US, from Qatar, from Russia, from Australia.""
Meanwhile the Fifa executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando, a one-time ally of the former Fifa presidential challenger Mohamed bin Hammam, has been banned from all football-related activity for 90 days.
The Sri Lankan was banned to prevent ""interference"" while Garcia, the chairman of the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee, investigates a case believed to relate to the alleged misuse of funds by the Asian Football Confederation.
Fernando accompanied Bin Hammam on his ill-fated trip to Trinidad while he was campaigning to replace Blatter as Fifa president, before pulling out when it was alleged Bin Hammam tried to bribe Caribbean delegates. Fifa subsequently dropped bribery charges after failing to find new evidence.
Despite his initial ban being annulled by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Bin Hammam resigned from all his football-related responsibilities in December after being charged with repeated violations while president of the AFC.
He was again banned for life by Fifa.
Blatter must convince a sceptical public that his ""roadmap to reform"", developed in the wake of the corruption allegations that reached crisis point ahead of the 2011 Congress when he was re-elected unopposed, will deliver meaningful steps to clean up the organisation.
Despite promising to bring in new term limits for senior executives, Blatter has also hinted that he may renege on an earlier promise to step down in 2015."

Qatar, which hugely outspent its rivals on its campaign to win the right to host the 2022 tournament in December 2010, had discussions about a $1m sponsorship deal for a gala dinner organised by the son of a Fifa executive committee member later banned from football for three years.
The Sunday Times, which conducted the undercover investigation that led to the Nigerian Amos Adamu and other Fifa officials being banned in the runup to the vote on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, revealed that Qatar's bidding committee entered talks to sponsor a gala dinner arranged by his son, Samson, on the eve of the South Africa World Cup in 2010.
The newspaper claims Qatar made arrangements to sponsor the dinner but did not go through with the deal after taking into account Fifa's rules on payments to executive committee members. The gala dinner, featuring 20 African footballing legends and senior football officials in Johannesburg for the World Cup, eventually cost around a fifth of the seven-figure sum originally discussed. It remains unclear how it was ultimately funded.
Fifa said that it was contacted with the allegations on Friday and the Sunday Times immediately provided all evidence relating to them. ""After receiving these documents, Fifa has immediately forwarded them to Michael J Garcia, independent ethics committee chairman of the investigatory branch,"" a spokesman said. ""It will be for Michael Garcia to analyse the documents and decide on any potential next steps.""
The Qatar 2022 organising committee accused the Sunday Times of being ""malicious and reckless"" in its presentation of the discussions but admitted that they took place. ""The truth is that our bid committee, after careful consideration, opted not to sign any agreement with the individual concerned and had no part whatsoever in the African Legends Dinner event, financially or otherwise,"" it claimed.
""It is correct that such a project was the subject of discussions, that preliminary communications were exchanged and that a draft agreement came into existence. However, upon due consideration being given to all the circumstances of this particular case  and especially to the relevant Fifa rules relating to the obligations of bid committees  a decision was taken by the Qatar 2022 bid committee not to pursue any involvement in the African Legends Dinner.""
Qatar won the race to host the 2022 World Cup despite its small size and high summer temperatures following a lavishly funded campaign that included a string of deals with big-name ambassadors and contracts such as that to sponsor the 2010 Confederation of African Football congress.
The Qatar 2022 organising committee insisted on Sunday it ""operated to the highest standards of integrity during the bidding process for the 2018/2022 Fifa World Cups, strictly adhering to all Fifa rules and regulations for bidding nations"" and said it was making ""good progress"" with preparations for the tournament.
A succession of senior figures, led by the Uefa president Michel Platini, have lobbied for the tournament to be moved to winter despite the fact the bid was won on the basis of a summer World Cup.
Garcia, an American lawyer who was appointed to run the investigatory arm of Fifa's ethics committee as part of an overhaul instigated by Mark Pieth, chairman of Fifa's independent governance committee, has an overflowing intray.
Pieth's appointment was part of an attempt by Fifa president Sepp Blatter to respond to an avalanche of corruption allegations engulfing the organisation in the wake of the World Cup vote and a subsequent presidential election overwhelmed by claims of bribery.
Garcia has said he will look into the opaque and controversial bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively, and the issues raised by the longstanding ISL case.
Swiss court documents, recently published by Fifa, confirmed the now defunct marketing agency paid millions of dollars in bribes to the former president Joao Havelange and former Fifa executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira.
At the same time as Garcia's appointment, the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was selected to chair the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee. In September, Eckert said that Blatter should play his part in cleaning up Fifa or resign  prompting an angry response from the Fifa president."

But Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the supreme committee for Qatar 2022, admitted to frustrations at the accusations that have been directed at their bid.
A leaked email from the Fifa general secretary, Jérôme Valcke, in May said Qatar's Fifa member, Mohamed Bin Hammam, ""thought you can buy Fifa as they bought the World Cup"".
There have also been claims by a whistleblower who had worked for the bid, repeated under parliamentary privilege but later retracted, that Qatar paid bribes to two African Fifa members.
Thawadi told the Leaders in Football conference at Stamford Bridge: ""We did not expect this avalanche of allegations and accusations.
""Baseless accusations were made against our bid, we were presumed guilty before innocent without a shred of evidence being produced. We conducted our bid to the highest ethical and moral standards.
""It was very, very frustrating as we had worked very hard on delivering the messages, and our campaign was a very good campaign. To hear the innuendos being the main headline hurt us.""
Bin Hammam, who promoted the successful vote for Qatar among fellow Fifa members, has since been banned for life by Fifa for bribery in connection with his presidential campaign.
Thawadi said Qatar 2002 were ""completely independent"" of Bin Hammam, who is appealing against his ban. He added: ""Mohamed Bin Hammam is his own man. He and Qatar 2022 are completely independent and separate. The appeal is his decision and his steps. We have to ride it out as patiently as having to ride out the whistleblower allegations and others.""
In relation to the Valcke email, he added: ""It leads back to the same issues: frustration. I think Jérôme Valcke came out and pointed out what he meant by that statement.
""We did put considerable resources into our bidding process. It is not a fact we denied. We put in considerable resources to get our messages heard as loud as the other bidding nations.""
Thawadi also confirmed that fans will be able to buy alcohol during the tournament. ""Alcohol will be available but may not be as available as it will be in London,"" he said. ""Any fan who wants to enjoy the World Cup with a drink will be able to find a drink."""

Phaedra al-Majid says she invented the claims that the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid had bribed Fifa members in return for votes as revenge for losing her job. The claims she made to the Sunday Times were made public by Parliament's culture, media and sport committee in May.
Robertson backed the committee's decision to make those allegations public and said Fifa should not be let off the hook  especially with other corruption cases still to be dealt with by the organisation.
""I do not think this dilutes the case for substantial reform of Fifa one bit,"" Robertson said. ""There are still many other issues that it faces. I have just come back from the International Olympic Committee session in Durban last week where they had the vote for the 2018 Winter Olympics and there was absolutely nothing that questioned the fundamental integrity of that process.
""That is how it needs to be for Fifa  they have got to get themselves into that position too. They are not anywhere near there at the moment.""

Fifa dropped the investigation against Jack Warner, the Fifa vice-president who was also suspended, after he resigned from all his positions in international football. Robertson said that the select committee had been right to make the whistleblower's claims public.
""They would have been heavily criticised if they had not put that information into the public domain,"" he said. ""I am entirely supportive of their decision to do so. The can only act on the information that is put in front of them."""

In an exclusive first newspaper interview since Fifa awarded Qatar the right to host the World Cup on December 2, Hassan al-Thawadi, the bid's chief executive, argued that the suspicion and allegations against the bid are fuelled partly by anti-Arab prejudice.
""I do not believe these claims are being made out of racism,"" Thawadi said, speaking to the Guardian in Doha, the Qatari capital. ""But I genuinely think that ignorance fed into prejudice and made it a more fertile ground for these rumours to take seed and grow. I do believe there is prejudice against the fact that we are a rich, Arab nation  yes, I think there is genuine prejudice there.""
Acknowledging that he was awarded a huge budget from Qatar's government to market and support the bid  although he adamantly refused to reveal its true figure  Thawadi insisted the bid was conducted cleanly. He said he had considered establishing an independent investigation, and was going to ask Lord Coe, whose reputation for integrity is high at Fifa, to chair it, but decided there was no reason why he should and it would be unworkable.
""I said to Mike Lee [the English consultant to the Qatar and London 2012 Olympic bids] I wanted to approach Seb Coe to be chairman of that committee. But in the end, why do I have to prove my innocence when there is not a shred of evidence? Why should we have an investigation if no other country has one, even Russia, which won the 2018 World Cup by the same people on the same day after the same process?""
Thawadi was critical of the House of Commons select committee for culture, media and sport for publishing with parliamentary privilege the most damaging accusation against Qatar, that three African Fifa executive committee members were paid $1.5m (£0.94m) to secure their votes. That allegation was supplied to the committee by the Sunday Times, which had not published it, saying it was based on information from ""a whistleblower who had worked with the Qatar bid"", and warning that the allegation was unproven. Without giving the bid any notice or inquiring about the story's validity, the select committee published it, allowing the allegation to be reported protected by parliamentary privilege.
The select committee did then publish Qatar's response, saying the story had been ""fabricated"" by a former member of staff with ""an axe to grind"", but Thawadi believed it was an unfair use of parliamentary privilege to publish the allegation without any evidence supporting it.
On Sunday the whistleblower retracted her story, publicly identifying herself as Phaedra Almajid, formerly the Qatar bid's international media specialist, who said she had done it to ""hurt"" the bid after she was removed from her job in March 2010. Thawadi and his team have been in close touch with her, and facilitated a conversation with the Guardian in which she retracted her story. Both she and Thawadi said the bid team did not threaten or pressure her or offer her any inducement.
John Whittingdale, the chairman of the select committee, has defended the publication, saying the committee did so because Fifa would not investigate. However, at that point, the Sunday Times had not yet presented Fifa with the allegation.
""I do feel absolute surprise and disappointment,"" Thawadi said. I understand and respect parliamentary privilege, but my country's reputation and my bid's reputation is being sullied, tarnished, because of these allegations.""
Thawadi said he was also ""disappointed"" by the statement revealed in a leaked email by Jérôme Valcke, Fifa's general-secretary, that Qatar ""bought the World Cup"". Thawadi said the bid had immediately sent Valcke a strong condemnatory letter reserving the right to sue him, and Valcke issued a clarification, saying he had been referring to Qatar's large budget, not alleging corruption.
Thawadi, in a long interview and several further discussions, pleaded for Qatar's bid to be considered ""on merit"" and the value of hosting the World Cup in the Middle East."

The allegations, that Qatar's bid paid $1.5m (£935,000) to Issa Hayatou, Jacques Anouma and Amos Adamu, to secure their votes, were not published by any newspaper, but the House of Commons select committee for culture, media and sport did, based on a letter from the Sunday Times. That meant the allegations of serious corruption, revealed by ""a whistleblower who had worked with the Qatar bid"", could be reported around the world with the protection of parliamentary privilege.
The whistleblower, publicly identifying herself as Phaedra Almajid, was employed as an international media specialist at Qatar's 2022 bid between May 2009 and March 2010. She now says she entirely fabricated that story of bribes paid by the Qatar bid, and other corruption allegations, because she wanted to ""hurt"" the bid after they decided to move her from her job. She said she was ""furious"" at the bid's suggestion that she was not handling the international media competently, and, ""acting irrationally"", decided to make up the corruption stories ""to show them I could control the international media"".
She now says she came to feel ""sorry"" and ""guilty"" for having severely damaged the bid's reputation, and that she never expected her fabricated stories to reach as far as the UK parliament and an intention by Fifa to investigate them.
The Guardian spoke to Almajid from Qatar itself, where we conducted an exclusive newspaper interview with the bid's chief executive, Hassan Al-Thawadi, which will appear on Tuesday. He said Almajid had been in contact with the bid wanting to retract her story, and facilitated our conversation with her. Both she and the bid insist they did not put pressure on her to issue her retraction, nor paid her or helped her in any way.
""The decision to make this admission is entirely my own,"" she said in a statement made on a website specifically created for her retraction. ""I have not been subject to any form of pressure or been offered any financial inducement.""
This is the latest twist in the series of corruption allegations which have beset Fifa both before and after a majority of its executive committee members awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia and 2022 to Qatar, on 2 December last year. The Sunday Times wrote to the select committee in May, setting out what it said were ""credible"" but ""unproven"" allegations that Qatar were paying bribes to secure votes.
These were mostly based on conversations with aspiring World Cup bid fixers held by undercover reporters posing as lobbyists for the US bid. But the paper also included the never-published allegations from the whistleblower that Qatar had paid $1.5m to Hayatou, Anouma and Adamu ""to secure their votes"".The committee emphasised the whistleblower's story in its report published last month to support the finding that it was ""appalled by the allegations of corruption"". The report said that although the allegations had been ""challenged"" by the Qatar bid team  whose letter said the story was fabricated  and in person by the English consultant, Mike Lee, who worked for the Qatar bid, the committee considered them: ""Sufficiently serious for Fifa to commission a full, urgent and independent investigation"".
John Whittingdale, the select committee's chairman, told the Guardian that despite Almajid's retraction, he stands by the decision to publish the allegations naming Qatar and the three executive committee members.
""I can understand why Qatar would be upset about it,"" he said, ""but our intention was to stress that these were serious allegations which Fifa was not investigating. If it turns out it was all a fabrication, which is a good outcome for Qatar, that has come out because we published.""
Fifa has said it was seeking to fully investigate the whistleblower's story, but that she had imposed excessive demands, including not guaranteeing the accuracy of her information, and wanting ""a comprehensive witness protection programme"".
Almajid told the Guardian she presented those conditions knowing they would be impossible for Fifa to accept, because she did not want to become involved in an investigation. She then decided to retract and apologise, which included publicly identifying herself, because, she said: ""If I remained anonymous it would only fix the story halfway, and that makes me feel guilty. I know I have done a lot of damage, and I really do want to apologise to the Qatar bid, Fifa, Adamu, Hayatou and Anouma.""
She said she apologised to the Qatar bid when she contacted them to say she wanted to retract. They discussed it with her and she has sworn an affidavit, which the Guardian has seen.
In it, she stated she made up the bribes story, and that she fabricated then leaked an internal document to suggest that Qatar was considering financially bailing out clubs in Argentina. Almajid also stated that she leaked information about the payment of Qatar's bid ambassadors, who included Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, which was based on incomplete internal documentation.
Emphasising that she ""was never threatened,"" or promised anything to retract, Almajid said she now wanted to ""undo the harm I have done""."

Warner was, until his resignation last month three weeks after his provisional suspension on corruption charges, president of the Concacaf confederation made up of countries from North and Central America and the Caribbean, as well as a Fifa vice-president.
As Concacaf president it would have been shocking for Warner to have backed Qatar over the USA, one of the countries in his confederation.
But Patrick John, the president of the Dominica Football Association and a long-time ally of Warner, claims that he did vote for Qatar  and that the charges against Warner were a result of a conspiracy organised in response by the USA and England.
John told local radio in Dominica: ""The whole thing is a conspiracy against Jack Warner. Jack promised the United States to push for the World Cup but when the thing came along at Fifa level Jack supported Qatar. That hurt the United States.
""Jack promised the English FA to push for the World Cup for them, but Jack sided with Russia so these two federations are up in arms against Jack. They are the only federations making trouble.""
Warner insisted that was not the case, saying in an email: ""If Mr John did say so then that is nonsense but I imagine that one day all of this foolishness will come to an end.""
Warner and his fellow Fifa member Mohamed bin Hammam were provisionally suspended after being charged with bribery. It was alleged they organised cash gifts totalling $1m (£625,000) to Caribbean officials while Bin Hammam was campaigning for the Fifa presidency.
Bin Hammam expressed his hope that he will receive a fair hearing when he appears before Fifa's ethics committee later this month. The 62-year-old said he was disappointed by ""continuous leaks of confidential information"".
He said on his website: ""I am still looking for and hoping to receive a fair hearing  one which will not be influenced by any political agenda or motivation.
""These proceedings were initiated based on the allegations of vote buying. I hope that, by now, the investigation has identified whether or not there had been attempts by me  directly or indirectly  to buy votes, particularly from those who claimed to have received these monies.
""I hope that the decision will be made solely by the members of this committee and based solely on the facts presented and not based on assumptions or the wishes of people outside the committee.""
Bin Hammam repeated his earlier claim that ""there has been a bias against me"".
Fifa's ethics committee will meet on 22 and 23 July to hear the case against Bin Hammam, who had been the Asian confederation president until his suspension.
The ethics committee will also hear the cases of Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester, the two Caribbean Football Union officials who were also suspended.
Fifa dropped the investigation against Warner following his resignation from football-related activities, saying he was no longer under their jurisdiction."

During his three years as chairman of the world governing body's ethics committee, Coe sought to introduce new rules to avoid the kind of allegations that have rocked Fifa in recent weeks.
However, he feels the organisation ""took their foot off the pedal"" on his proposals when he stood down in 2009 to avoid a conflict of interest with his role in the England 2018 campaign.
Coe said in the Sunday Telegraph: ""There is absolutely no doubt that the view of me and some of my colleagues on the ethics committee was that once they [Fifa] had moved from continental rotation to actually choosing countries outside of that norm, the structure of that bidding process was not fit for purpose. There was no question about that.
""I suppose, for me, the only frustration was that when I got asked to help England's bid for 2018, we were as a committee at that stage putting a framework together for the bidding countries.
""I was driving it particularly because of the Olympic experience. It does appear to me that when I stepped down to do the England stuff, the thing that they took their foot off the pedal on was that.
""That now has to be a serious priority, to get some structure back into that. There's no excuse about time here because, as we know to our cost, they have got until 2022 to figure that out.""

In evidence published on Tuesday under parliamentary privilege by the select committee on football governance, the Sunday Times alleges that Michel Zen-Ruffinen, a former secretary general of Fifa, introduced the reporters to a certain Amadou Diallo. Zen-Ruffinen is said to have claimed that Qatar was ""using Diallo to arrange financial deals with the African [Fifa executive committee] members in exchange for World Cup votes"".
Diallo is said to have been a senior staff member in the entourage of Issa Hayatou, the Confederation of African Football's president. Ismail Bhamjee, himself a former member of the Fifa executive committee, was allegedly more explicit in his dialogue with the undercover reporters.
According to the letter sent by the Sunday Times to John Whittingdale, the chairman of the select committee inquiry into football governance, Bhamjee explained that some of Africa's current and former representatives on the Fifa executive committee had previously sold their votes. ""Bhamjee said  Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, Slim Aloulou of Tunisia and Amadou Diakite of the Ivory Coast had each been paid for their votes by Morocco when it was bidding against South Africa in the contest for the 2010 World Cup.""
Bhamjee is directly quoted in the letter as saying: ""I'm told the Africans will get  anything from a quarter to half a million dollars,"" in reference to alleged payments from the Qatar bid to African executive committee members. Asked to clarify whether that money was to invest in football or for them personally, Bhamjee reportedly replied: ""No, no, no, no. This is on top. This is separate from the football.""
Damian Collins, a Conservative MP on the select committee, put these allegations to Mike Lee, a strategic communications consultant to the Qatar 2022 bid who was appearing as a witness. Lee responded: ""I was working at the highest level of that bid and talking at length with the chairman and CEO and saw no evidence of any of these allegations.
""My experience is I would have had a sense if such things were going on and I had no sense of that.""
On Tuesday night the Qatar Football Association issued a statement in which they said they ""categorically deny"" the allegations. ""As the Sunday Times itself states, these accusations 'were and remain unproven'. They will remain unproven, because they are false,"" it said.
Specifically the Sunday Times claims that Diakite, the former Fifa executive committee member who remained intimately involved in the Fifa machine, talked about $1m (£611,000) to $1.2m payments for ""projects by Qatar in return for their 2022 vote"".
The newspaper says it highlighted these several allegations to Fifa in its own submission to the governing body. It comments: ""Fifa does not appear to have pursued any of these matters.""
A London law firm hired by the Qatar bid has strongly denied the allegations, calling them ""entirely false"". However the Sunday Times's letter said that it had separately spoken to ""a whistleblower who had worked with the Qatar bid"". That individual is said further to have claimed that Hayatou and his fellow executive committee member from the Ivory Coast, Jacques Anouma, had received $1.5m from Qatar ""to secure their votes"".
It added: ""The cash was to go to the three members' football federations but there would be no questions asked about how the money was used."" It quoted the whistleblower as saying: ""Basically if they took it into their pocket we don't give a jack."""

The OFC's acting head, David Chung, was expected to take Temarii's voting place on the executive committee but will not now be allowed to, leaving 22 members to make the decision.
""OFC can confirm that it has received a communiqué from Reynald Temarii's legal team stating that Mr Temarii will exercise his right of appeal in relation to the recent ruling by the Fifa ethics committee,"" the confederation said.

Chung said: ""OFC will not have a voice at the voting table in Zurich on 2 December but fully respects the decision made by Reynald Temarii and his legal team under difficult circumstances.""

The OFC's acting head, David Chung of Papua New Guinea, flew to Zurich expecting to take Temarii's place on the Fifa executive committee but he is now unlikely to be allowed to vote.
Temarii was suspended, along with Amos Adamu of Nigeria, following an investigation by the Sunday Times, which alleged the pair were prepared to sell their votes for cash.

That Teixeira personally received $9.5m (£6.1m) of the money International Sports and Leisure (ISL)  the Swiss company to which Fifa awarded marketing rights for successive World Cups  paid to Liechtenstein, via one of the companies, Sanud. Panorama claims the list it obtained shows the money going to Sanud in 21 different payments. Panorama feels confident about this allegation because Teixeira's links with Sanud emerged in a 2001 Brazilian senate inquiry into the running of football in the country. Teixeira declined to comment.
Is this new? Yes. The Brazilian inquiry traced financial connections between Sanud, the Liechtenstein company, and Teixeira and companies controlled by him. But Panorama's allegation is that the $9.5m to Sanud was paid by ISL.
What is the impact? This is a very serious bribery allegation. Teixeira is a senior Fifa executive committee member and president of the national association in Brazil  the world's most celebrated football country, which has won the right to host the next World Cup.
What are the allegations? That Léoz personally was paid $730,000 in five separate payments by ISL. The programme claims its list names Léoz personally receiving $200,000 three times in 1997 and 1998, sums which it claims were in addition to $130,000 he had been cited in court proceedings as having been paid. Léoz declined to comment.
Is this new? Yes. Léoz was named as the recipient of $130,000 in bribes in January and May 2000, in Swiss court proceedings into alleged financial impropriety by ISL managers. However, the three alleged payments of $200,000 have never emerged before.
What is the impact? This is a very serious bribery allegation. Fifa's response is that the Panorama allegations are not new and the Swiss authorities dealt with the allegations. However, Fifa has taken no action in relation to Léoz, despite his having been named in court proceedings for allegedly receiving bribes. He remains a powerful member of the executive committee.
What are the allegations? That Hayatou was personally paid 100,000 French francs by ISL. The programme claims that the list it has obtained, of payments by ISL to Fifa executive committee members and Liechtenstein companies, includes Hayatou, the money, and next to his name, the word barzahlung, the German for cash payment. Hayatou declined to comment.
Is this new? Yes.
What is the impact? This is a very serious bribery allegation. Hayatou is a long-term, senior member of the Fifa executive committee, representing increasingly significant African football nations. His support has been considered crucial figure by England's 2018 World Cup bid team, who have made personal visits to lobby him.
What are the allegations? That Warner ordered $84,240 worth of tickets for World Cup matches in South Africa this summer, in order to sell them on to ticket touts. If that had happened, it would certainly be a breach of Fifa rules; the programme describes it as ""continued involvement in the corrupt sale of World Cup tickets"". Warner declined to comment.
Is this new? Yes. Warner has previous form. In 2006, auditors Ernst and Young identified tickets bought in Warner's name for the World Cup in Germany were resold for three times the face value. A Fifa investigation subsequently found Warner's son Daryan played an active role, but ""no concrete evidence"" that Warner himself had been involved. Panorama claims Fifa privately ordered Warner's family company to donate $1m to charity to ""compensate"" for the money made from selling on the tickets.
What is the impact? Serious, depending how solidly it can be proven that the tickets were intended for resale. England's 2018 World Cup bid team has assiduously courted Warner for his votes.
What are the allegations? That ISL paid around $100m to these Liechtenstein companies between 1989 and 1999. Panorama alleges this money was paid on to Fifa officials in bribes to award ISL the Fifa contracts.
Is this new? The detail of payments made by ISL has never been revealed before, although the huge total paid out by ISL did emerge in Swiss court proceedings against ISL managers in 2008. Swiss prosecutors investigating ISL after its 2001 financial collapse stated publicly in June this year that ""foreign persons of Fifa institutions"" had admitted receiving money from ISL, and repaid 5.5m Swiss francs in ""redress"". No names were ever released. Panorama claims to have an itemised list of all the payments made, and to whom.
What is the impact? A Swiss MP interviewed by the programme, Roland Büchel, said the list of payments demonstrated the need for a full, independent inquiry into Fifa's finances."

The allegations come three days before the trio are to take part in Fifa's vote on the hosts for the 2018 and 2002 World Cups. Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung identify them as Ricardo Teixeira of Brazil, Nicolás Léoz of Paraguay and Issa Hayatou of Cameroon.
The reports say the men received kickbacks from the marketing agency ISL from 1988-99. ISL went bust in 2001. They say they obtained the same document that the BBC plans to feature in a Panorama documentary being aired tonight.
Tonight the BBC reported that its Panorama programme would detail the payments allegedly made to the three officials.
According to the BBC, Léoz, the head of South America's football confederation was named in court papers in connection with payments totalling $130,000 (£83,000). But Panorama claims to have obtained a confidential ISL document which lists 175 secret payments. It is alleged to show that Léoz was paid a further $600,000 (£384,000 using current conversions) in three instalments of $200,000. Léoz did not respond to requests for comment on Panorama's allegations.
The second Fifa official named by the programme is Teixeira, head of the Brazilian Football Confederation which is responsible for staging the 2014 World Cup. Panorama claims the ISL list shows a front company in Liechtenstein called Sanud received 21 payments totalling $9.5m (£6m). Teixeira was closely linked to Sanud by an inquiry of the Brazilian senate in 2001.
The list obtained by Panorama also includes details of 100,000 French Francs (£12,900) paid to Hayatou, the Fifa vice-president representing football in African nations. Hayatou also did not respond to the allegations when contacted by Panorama. Fifa also declined interview requests to address the allegations."

Although it was tonight unclear whether Fifa would sanction such a move, if successful it would force all nine bidding nations to again recalibrate their strategies as they attempt to plot a path to victory.
The OFC general secretary, Tai Nicholas, said tonight that Reynald Temarii, the OFC president who was suspended for a year after breaking Fifa rules on breach of confidence, was likely to waive his right to appeal if it meant a replacement could be parachuted in to vote.
Fifa stipulates that a full executive committee member can be removed only by its congress and had implied the vote would proceed with 22 members. But Nicholas insisted there were ""a number of legal options"" open to the OFC that would allow Temarii to be replaced.
The confederation has called an executive meeting in Auckland on Saturday to try to install David Chung, the acting president, as president and assume Temarii's position on the executive committee.
""We have one vote and it's fundamentally important that we have the right to our one vote on one of the biggest decisions in football for years,"" Nicholas told the website Inside World Football.
""It would be a big sacrifice in terms of the opportunity to clear himself for the sake of the OFC casting its vote, but he has always put the confederation first.""
A Fifa spokesman said it had yet to receive any official request from the OFC so would not comment. If the OFC was able to find a way to appoint Chung, he would almost certainly vote for Australia to host the 2022 tournament.
The implications for England would be less clear. Their bid team had heavily courted Temarii, who has protested his innocence and threatened to sue the Sunday Times, and were hopeful of his vote but others believe he was inclined to vote for Spain/Portugal. Going ahead with 23 voters would also strip Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, of his casting vote in the event of a tie.
Clarence House today confirmed that Prince William would join the England 2018 team in Zurich on Tuesday and stay until after the decision was announced on Thursday. The team, which also includes David Beckham and the prime minister David Cameron, will have to deal with the fallout from the BBC's Panorama documentary on alleged Fifa corruption, which will air on Monday night.
The presence of the Prince and Cameron for almost a full three days is seen as crucial in swaying executive committee members who may not have made up their minds where to switch their votes if their first choice drops out.
Lord Coe, a 2018 board member who brings experience of the final days of the 2012 Olympic bid, today repeated his call for ""clear heads"" and said Cameron's influence would be crucial.
""I know from feedback that he's made a big impression with the engagement that he's had so far in this process,"" said Coe. ""And it is very important that the executive committee members of Fifa know that this bid has the full support from the very highest political level in the land.""
The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, who will travel with Cameron on Tuesday, said it was important the BBC was able to justify the timing of the Panorama broadcast. ""If they are going to run the programme, please make sure that it is about proper investigative journalism and is not simply raking over old allegations,"" he said.
""I would always absolutely defend the right of the British press to expose corruption. It didn't make the bid any easier that the Sunday Times article proved there was something wrong with the process which Fifa, to give them credit, recognised and dealt with. I would absolutely defend that,"" he said.
""[But] I would be very cautious about people simply using the fact that this is newsworthy at the moment to produce a programme to drive up viewing. They need to make sure this is proper investigative journalism that adds to the debate."""

But its decision to only publish the technocratic executive summaries and not the more comprehensive risk assessments contained in the versions sent to the 22 exco members was yet another missed opportunity. The only way of comparing the nine bidders in the executive summaries, bizarrely, was by their ""legal risk"" to Fifa rather than the comprehensive list of rankings in the full reports. The detail contained in those reports were left to leak out piecemeal.
For England and the USA, the technical report  compiled after a series of summer inspection visits  is disproportionately important because a major part of their appeal is their low risk. ""You could lose on a negative technical report,"" said the 2018 chief executive Andy Anson yesterday.
Russia should be able to shrug off its more critical assessment as long as it can convince that the government will underwrite the risks involved in taking the World Cup to a new territory and ploughing billions into the infrastructure required. It is only Qatar, which received a ""high risk"" rating overall, that could see its chances substantially damaged by the reports.
In the final analysis, the technical reports on their own are unlikely to sway the voting intentions of any individual Fifa ex-co member, with other political and personal considerations more important.
But England hope that by highlighting problems with the Russian bid, in particular, they will give them some material to work with as they enter the crucial final straight and begin calculating where their support will go in a range of different scenarios.
The reports appear designed to give the impression that this is a process as rigorous as the International Olympic Commitee's. Having already admitted that it was a mistake to hold parallel bidding races for 2018 and 2022, to maximise commercial revenues and Sepp Blatter's re-election prospects, the reality is that it is anything but."

Aside from Spain/Portugal, the other countries competing to host the 2018 tournament are England, Russia and Holland/Belgium, while the 2022 World Cup hosts will be from Australia, USA, Qatar, Japan and South Korea.
The winning bids are set to be announced following a vote by the Fifa executive committee in Zurich on 2 December."

More than one bidding nation is believed to be considering the possibility of legal action against rivals if the result does not go their way, in view of the chaos that now surrounds the process.
With the Nigerian executive committee member, Amos Adamu, and the Oceania representative, Reynald Tamarii, provisionally suspended by Fifa while its ethics committee investigates allegations that they effectively offered to sell their vote, it is also examining separate rumours that two bids offered to trade blocs of votes.
One of the two bids understood to be under investigation by the committee, chaired by Claudio Sulser, has hit back at the allegations. The joint Spain and Portugal bid  aiming to secure the 2018 tournament in the face of competition from England, Russia and Belgium/Holland  is alleged to have colluded with Qatar to swap votes under their influence. The votes of up to seven executive committee members could be involved.
While he did not confirm the two countries involved Jérôme Valcke, the Fifa secretary general, said this week: ""We got the information a few weeks ago and there have been rumours saying that it definitely took place.""
The Qatar bid today declined to comment, but the leaders of the Iberian bid reacted furiously. Gilberto Madail, the president of the Portuguese federation, said: ""We received with surprise and indignation the analysis that Fifa's ethics committee may conduct on a rumour ... circulated in September in the English media about an alleged deal between the Iberian and the Qatari bids for hosting the World Cup,"" said Gilberto Madail, the president of the Portuguese federation.
""It is odd that there is an attempt to launch completely unfounded suspicions about the Iberian bid at a time when there are news reports about alleged vote-selling for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups involving other bids.""
It is understood that Fifa has been in touch with both the Qatar and the Spain/Portugal bids to seek further information in the wake of the claims.
With further revelations expected in this weekend's Sunday Times, the ethics committee has already watched 90 minutes of footage collected by the newspaper.
Adamu also again protested his innocence yesterday, telling the BBC he was a ""credible person"".
""I'm very, very confident because what was pushed to the public is not a true reflection of what really transpired between me and the journalists,"" said Adamu, who is banned from all football-related activities while the case is investigated and admitted he was not supposed to comment on it.
""I believe in the credibility of Fifa and the Fifa president, I know that my reputation is intact and the investigation will prove it."" Temarii has also said he is innocent of the allegations.
The ethics committee has promised to deliver its verdict on the pair by the middle of next month, but the vote is supposed to take place just two weeks later.
Next week, the Fifa executive committee will proceed with plans to meet to finalise the voting procedure, despite it being unclear how many of its members will be present for the decision on December 2.
Meanwhile, Russia yesterday confirmed it was pulling out of the race for the 2022 World Cup to concentrate on the 2018 tournament. England last week did the same."

The Nigerian's hearing is set for the same day another Fifa official, Reynald Temarii, faces a similar case.
Adamu declined to comment after meeting the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, who has promised an ""in-depth investigation"" into corruption allegations against the two officials.
The probe follows a report in the Sunday Times  based on a sting investigation by undercover reporters  that Adamu and Temarii offered to sell their votes in the bidding for the World Cup. The Fifa vote on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is scheduled for 2 December in Zurich.
The Fifa ethics committee is chaired by Claudio Sulser, a lawyer and former Switzerland international player. The panel can enforce any punishment in Fifa's disciplinary code, including banning officials ""from taking part in any kind of football-related activity"".
Temarii, the Oceania Football Confederation president, said that he made a mistake in talking to the reporters, who secretly filmed him asking for £1.5m to fund a football academy in Auckland, New Zealand.
""I'm confident about my integrity but I made a mistake by talking in that way,"" Temarii said. ""I asked the Fifa president to investigate. I gave him a letter. It's important for me that the ethics committee investigates how I manage my relations with bidders.""
Adamu was also secretly filmed by the reporters, who posed as lobbyists for a consortium of American companies, saying that he wanted £500,000 to build four artificial football pitches in Nigeria. The reporters had no connection to the official US World Cup bid committee and no money changed hands.
Adamu told the reporters he would want the money paid to him personally, saying: ""Certainly if you are to invest that, that means you also want the vote.""
He offered a ""guarantee"" to vote for the Americans in the 2018 race, but said they would be his second preference in 2022. The US withdrew last Friday from the 2018 contest to focus on 2022."

Although some members say the vote should go ahead on 2 December, it is understood that a postponement is being talked about in senior circles of the world governing body.
England, Russia, Spain/Portugal and Holland/Belgium are bidding for the 2018 World Cup. The USA, Australia, Qatar, Japan and South Korea are bidding to host the 2022 tournament.
The Fifa ethics committee will this week begin an investigation into a Sunday Times exposé of two members of the 24-man Fifa executive committee, Amos Adamu from Nigeria and Reynald Temarii from Tahiti, who is the president of the Oceania Football Confederation.
Reporters from the Sunday Times newspaper posed as English-based lobbyists for a consortium of private American companies who wanted to help secure the World Cup for the United States. At an initial meeting in London, Adamu is said to have told reporters that he wanted $800,000 (£500,000) to build four artificial football pitches in his country. Temarii is also alleged to have asked for a payment, in his case to finance a sports academy.
When contacted, Adamu refused to comment. Temarii was unavailable for comment.
A Fifa statement read: ""Fifa and the Fifa ethics committee have closely monitored the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 Fifa World Cups and will continue to do so.
""Fifa has already requested to receive all of the information and documents related to this matter, and is awaiting to receive this material. In any case, Fifa will immediately analyse the material available and only once this analysis has concluded will Fifa be able to decide on any potential next steps.
""In the meantime, Fifa is not in a position to provide any further comments on this matter.""
The Oceania Football Confederation said it was investigating the reports. A statement said: ""OFC is aware of the story that appeared in the Sunday Times in England today. As such, OFC is currently looking into the matter.""
Adamu told the Sunday Times he had been talking about business in Nigeria after the World Cup and said that his vote was not for sale."

Such deals are banned under Fifa's bidding rules and the organisation's secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, told Bloomberg: ""We will send reminders on the rules and conduct via our ethics committee. There are a lot of rumours around 2018-22 but I think we are monitoring efficiently what is done by the nine bidders, and we will also inform our executive committee members again at our next meeting in October about such rumours on vote-sharing and their responsibility.""
England, Russia, Spain/Portugal, Holland/Belgium and the United States are bidding for the 2018 tournament, though the US may pull out before the vote by Fifa's executive committee on 2 December to concentrate on 2022. Qatar, Australia, Japan and South Korea are also bidding to host 2022."

As part of an ongoing attempt to bring order to an unwieldy procedure Fifa has written to all nine bidders outlining the new rules. Its secretary-general, Jérôme Valcke, said they must now inform the world governing body of any contact with the 24 members of the executive committee or their associations.
They will be required to write to Fifa's ethics committee ahead of any ""direct or indirect"" contact, outlining their reasons for doing so and providing further information if necessary.
Previously bidders have been free to meet and present to the various executive committee members with impunity. England's 2018 bid has already clocked up tens of thousands of miles delivering presentations around the world.
Fifa said it wanted to ""better monitor"" contact and protect the independence of voters who noted that ""various"" bidders approached them, sometimes informally, during the World Cup in South Africa.
Some of the 24 executive committee members, who will vote in Zurich on 11 December to decide the host nation for the 2018 tournament, were heard to complain that they had become weary of being persistently lobbied by the bidding nations.
England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup was considered to have had a fruitful month in South Africa, with its international president, David Dein, leading the lobbying effort.
The 2018 tournament is widely seen as a three?horse race between Russia, England and the joint bid from Spain and Portugal. There is also a joint bid from Holland and Belgium, which is considered an outsider.
Although the United States are nominally still bidding for 2018 as well, that tournament is expected to go to Europe with the Americans battling Australia and Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. Japan and the Korea Republic are also in the running for 2022.
Fifa also reminded bidders of the rules on gifts for executive committee members. It says gifts must be of merely symbolic value and must not influence the bidding process.
The Australian bid was recently hit by a string of allegations in its domestic press about its spending on gifts, trips and consultants. But it was exonerated by the Australian government, which is largely funding the bid, and has vowed to sue the newspapers concerned.
Fifa also today outlined the process for the technical inspection visits that will begin in Japan this month and end in Qatar in September.
The Fifa delegation, which now includes the South Africa 2010 chief executive, Danny Jordaan, will visit England between 23 and 26 August."

Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam stressed to delegates at the AFC Extraordinary Congress in South Africa that Asian Fifa executive committee members were free to support any bid.
""I want to assure Europe on behalf of AFC that we recognise and support their desire to host the 2018 edition,"" said Bin Hammam.
""It will be an open bid and everybody is free to support anyone. But our support is for Europe when it comes to 2018. The mood inside the Fifa Executive Committee is that Europe should host the 2018 version.""
Bin Hammam also underlined the AFC's determination to win the rights to the 2022 World Cup following the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea.
""We have four countries who are very capable of hosting the World Cup,"" said Bin Hammam. ""And hosting the World Cup is the legitimate right of all member associations. Asia will put its best foot forward.""

The ethics committee has written to all bidding nations  England are among those  telling them to ""respect fair play"".
The rules of conduct laid down by Fifa are not as stringent as the IOC's for Olympic bids but still outlaw financial ""gifts"".
They also prohibit any bidding nation doing a deal with another  for example England agreeing to back the USA for 2022 in return for support for their 2018 campaign.
Claudio Sulser, a former Swiss international player who became a lawyer, has been appointed the new chairman of the Fifa ethics committee after the previous chairman Sebastian Coe stepped down to become part of England's bid.
Fifa said in a statement: ""The committee agreed to send a letter to all of the member associations bidding for the 2018 and 2022 Fifa World Cups in order to remind them that they have signed regulations to respect fair play in this contest and that the ethics committee will remain vigilant to ensure that all regulations are adhered to.""
Fifa's president Sepp Blatter added: ""Football has reached a huge economic dimension. All of this brings not only a social responsibility, but a moral commitment too. This is why it is so important to have an independent ethics committee that can supervise and make sure that fair play and the code of ethics are respected.""
Sulser, who is also a member of the Olympic anti-doping committee, said he was honoured to chair the committee.
""I am certain that we can do something positive if we work together as a team, with a transparent approach and with a clear application of the code of ethics in order to protect the integrity of football,"" said Sulser."
