Hassan al-Thawadis comments came as the UK sports minister Stuart Andrew said he would wear the rainbow-coloured armband at the England v Wales match on Tuesday.
The Conservative frontbencher, who is gay, said it was really unfair that Fifa had threatened sporting sanctions at the 11th hour against seven European teams who had planned to wear the anti-discrimination symbol in Qatar, forcing them to protest in other ways.
I want to show support and I was delighted to see that the German minister who attended a recent match has worn it, I think it is important that I do so, he added.
However, Thawadi  secretary general of the supreme World Cup committee for delivery and legacy  said he had an issue with the armband because he saw it as a protest against Islamic values and an Islamic country hosting such a major event.
If the teams decided to do it throughout the entire season, that is one thing, he said, when asked if he felt nervous about armbands. But if youre coming to make a point, or a statement in Qatar, that is something I have an issue with. And it goes back to the simple fact that this is a part of the world that has its own set of values.
This is not Qatar Im talking about, its the Arab world, he added. For the teams to come and preach or make statements, thats fine. But what youre essentially saying is youre protesting an Islamic country hosting an event. Where does that end? Does that mean no Islamic country can never be able to participate in anything?
Theres going to be different values and different views coming in. So, for me, if youre going to come specifically to make a statement here in Qatar  or specifically addressed to Qatar and by extension, the Islamic world  it leaves a very divisive message.
Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar and while organisers and Fifa have repeated the message that everyone is welcome during the World Cup, it is unclear whether laws that criminalise acts such as kissing in public have been suspended.
Fans attending matches have also had rainbow items, including T-shirts and Wales bucket hats, confiscated by officials, before Fifa later said they should be allowed in stadiums.
But Thawadi said organisers only wanted visitors to respect the culture and religion of the region. These values are regional, he added. Its for the Islamic world, its for the Arab world, its for the Middle East. There are certain things that we will not agree upon. But let us find a way of coexisting and moving forward, one way or the other. That is where mutual respect is fundamental.

In his interview with the TalkSport UK radio station, Thawadi also defended the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, for his pre-tournament remarks in which he said he felt Qatari, Arabic, African, gay and disabled, before warning western countries that they were in no position to give morality lessons to Qatar given their past and current behaviour.
For a lot of people in Qatar and the Arab world what he said to a large extent reflected the frustration of 13 years being presented in a certain way in the media, said Thawadi.
A lot of Arabs that Ive talked to have admired what he said. It addressed the fact that people did feel that the outside world is coming and passing judgment unequivocally on our part of the world  on us as people, on the Arab world and the Middle East."

In many ways, the clamp down by Fifa on the wearing of them is ironic, too, because everyone within the federations who put together this show of support has worked hard to build a new OneLove brand almost to detach from the rainbow, to dilute and depoliticise an issue that is unavoidably political.
The whole episode was disappointing because even the most watered-down attempt to show that football should be an inclusive and welcoming space was too much. For Fifa to threaten players and the federations for trying to promote a symbolic message of unity, togetherness, tolerance and inclusion goes against all the values and principles that it says it stands for and wants to promote as the global governing body of the game.
There have been plenty who have argued that players, fans and federations should stick to football and that we should respect the culture of the host nation, but this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues. If we accepted segregation as part of the culture of a place or time then we would still be living with anti-interracial marriage laws and who knows what else.

Arguing this is the liberal west trying to impose its values and principles on a country and a competition that dont want it also hugely negates the lived experiences of any LGBTQ+ players competing in the tournament, as well as the LGBTQ+ fans in the stands. Perhaps most criminally, it also lets down representatives of the LGBTQ+ communities within Qatar, who need global support and the platform of the World Cup to have a voice about whats going on for them and the freedoms theyre fighting for.
The accusation that it is racist to discuss these issues because it shows a lack of respect for Qatari or Islamic culture is wrong, but there has been a tinge of racism regarding discussions. In many forums the narrative becomes that this is the uncultured Middle East v the progressive west, but that undermines the issues and leads to whataboutery. We should not be coming across as holier than thou but acknowledging that problems can exist all over the world, in all societies, at the same time.
In Britain we have a lot of issues. I would argue that rising homelessness and people not being able to afford energy is also a human rights abuse, that people should not have to be suffering in the way they are because of the negligence of the government.
All of these things can exist at the same time. I can be critical of our government, our country and the way things are operating here as well as being critical of other countries. Human rights abuses and discrimination should not even be up for debate. It should be a given that you take an ethical and moral position on these issues, but at the first sign of a pushback from Fifa the federations folded.
There are huge pressures on players. Many dont just support themselves financially but their extended families, too. And there is a real feeling of powerlessness. There is a feeling that whatever they do, nothing will change. That is why federations need to take a stand, as governing bodies but also in supporting their players voices.
If everyone gave up at the first hurdle in the fight for freedoms and equality, then where would be today? Look at John Carlos, Tommie Smith and Peter Norman, who stood on the 200m podium at the 1968 Olympics and risked everything  Smith and Carlos raised their fists in support of the Black Power movement, with all three donning badges in support for the Olympic Project for Human Rights.
Its a sacrifice, and sometimes it is a personal sacrifice, but the long?term effect and the impact that acts of solidarity or protest can have are far reaching. We should be taking pride in the position we want to stand on and should be reflecting on how we want to be seen in the next 100 years.

The decision to set the armbands aside in the face of sporting sanctions is incredibly weak and stands in stark contrast to the actions of the players of Iran. They have risked being disowned by their own nation, their own government and put themselves, their families and their friends in potential danger by not singing the national anthem before the game against England in support of the protests back home. They understand, though, that the World Cup is a platform and an opportunity to bring global attention to a very important and critical issue within their own country. That shows courage and strength and it should empower others.
If a womens team had been put in the position of the teams involved and been threatened with sporting sanctions, I feel like the response would have been different. Why? Because as women weve been used to having to sacrifice and make difficult choices just to be able to play football, even when we know theres a consequence. Indeed, the two people to wear the armband despite Fifas condemnation have been women  the former England international Alex Scott and Germanys interior minister, Nancy Faeser.
The Germany players covering their mouths in protest against the threat of sanctions and a number of federations and players speaking out strongly against the pressure to not wear the armband should be applauded, but its not enough. Every day, migrant workers, women and LGBTQ+ people put their lives on the line just by existing in Qatar. Not being able to stomach sporting sanctions in that context is incredibly weak."

The list of items banned at the World Cup continues to grow, most recently with reports that England fans have been told not to wear crusader costumes, occasionally favoured by middle-aged white men as misguided-at-best clothing for international matches.
Here we take a look at the items banned in Qatar so far.
Alcohol was banned for fans at the grounds in a last-minute and unprecedented volte-face two days before the tournament started. The sale of alcohol was limited to the Fifa fan festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues.
Fifa in effect banned the wearing of the armbands when it threatened to impose sanctions on any players who did so. A number of players, including the England captain, Harry Kane, had intended to wear the armband as a gesture, in part to highlight Qatars appalling human rights record, including but not limited to the treatment of LGBT+ people and the plight of potentially thousands of migrant workers who built the infrastructure for the tournament.
Football Association of Wales staff and Wales supporters have reportedly had rainbow-coloured bucket hats confiscated. Fifa and the Qataris were said to be in talks on the matter on Tuesday, where Fifa reminded the hosts of their assurances before the tournament that everyone was welcome and rainbow flags would be allowed.
Among reports were incidents of Welsh FA staff and fans being confronted by security for bringing the hats into the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium and a US fan with a rainbow flag being confronted on the metro. But on Friday, Fifa said fans would be allowed to wear rainbow bucket hats and take rainbow flags into the stadium for Waless match against Iran.
The Fifa stadium code of conduct states that fans must not remove items of clothing or otherwise remain in a state of undress  including being shirtless. And they must not reveal intimate body parts.
The Times reported that England fans had been told not to dress as St George, the patron saint of England, portrayed as a crusader knight with mock chainmail and, often, a plastic sword.
The Crusades were a series of bloody religious wars in which Christian invaders, directed by the Latin church attempted to recover Jerusalem and its surrounding area from Islamic rule. Estimates of the death toll vary widely from 1.5 million to as many as 6 million. Fifa said: Crusader costumes in the Arab context can be offensive against Muslims. That is why anti-discrimination colleagues asked fans to wear things inside out or change dress."

Despite facing criticism for backing down after coming under pressure from Fifa, the English Football Associations options were limited by concerns that the sporting sanctions for Harry Kane could have been worse than an instant booking if the captain had worn the armband against Iran. There were also fears that Gareth Southgates side could have been prevented from entering the field.
The FAs worries were shared by the other six countries involved in the OneLove campaign after talks with world footballs governing body, with those close to the process left with the impression that Fifa could do anything to any captain who wore the armband in Qatar.

The German federation has described Fifas behaviour as extreme blackmail and sources have indicated there was no clarity over whether the captains would merely receive a caution.
England, Wales, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark feared their captains could be banned. It was unclear whether any suspension would be limited to one match. None of the countries were prepared to put their players in that position. A source said that the captains would have risked unlimited liability if they had defied Fifas warnings.
Separately the FA was concerned that Englands game against Iran would not have started if Kane had tried to leave the dressing room with the armband. The FA is exploring if it will be legally possible to challenge the threat of sporting sanctions, and there has been fury within the seven associations about Fifas behaviour.
Suggestions that Kane could have created an iconic moment by walking on to the pitch with the armband and receiving an instant booking are misplaced. The yellow card would have been shown in the dressing room, stripping away any potential symbolism.
Southgate, speaking before Fridays game against the USA, was asked about the threat of sanctions for Kane. I dont know all the ins and outs because I wasnt in the meeting but there was definitely a feel there were sanctions and not all of those were really clear, I think, so the decision was taken out of the hands of Harry, Englands head coach said.
The decision from the organisation was: Were not even putting the armband in the dressing room. There is no discussion. The player had no say.
Germanys players were praised for covering their mouths with their hands to suggest they had been gagged by Fifa before their game against Japan on Wednesday. Six players, including the captain, Manuel Neuer, also wore Adidas boots with rainbow stitching during the teams shock 2-1 defeat against Japan, and the squad sported tops with rainbow colours on their sleeves in the warm-up.
Germany have faced no punishment from Fifa but Southgate questioned whether there would be any value in England mounting a similar form of protest on Friday.

Im quite comfortable with our position and I think we should be confident in what we stand for, Southgate said. There was a plan  we werent able to carry out that plan. What do we do now? Do we all try to outdo each other on a gesture that, however we do it, probably wont be enough.
We want to support the LGBTQ community in particular and recognise that a lot of those people arent here with us, and we wanted them here with us. But we could also rush into doing things that dont really make any difference.
I understand that is going to be uncomfortable for people because I could be criticised, the captain has been criticised, the organisation will be criticised. Im very comfortable with what I stand for, and how I deal with people every day of my life is more important than a statement that might land well and might not.
Kane trained on Thursday and will start on Friday after an injury scare. Southgate indicated that England, who would seal progress from Group B by beating the USA, will name an unchanged side against Gregg Berhalters team. James Maddison is still recovering from a knee injury.
Harry Maguire, who has recovered from the dehydration that forced him off against Iran, has opened up on the criticism he has faced and compared it to the negativity aimed at his former Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Hes one of the greatest players ever and gets criticised day in, day out, he said. So if its going to happen to him I think its part and parcel of the game.
Southgate revealed that Prince William had told Englands players to block out distractions on social media. We couldnt have paid him for better advice, Southgate said."

This has prompted Germanys football federation to announce plans to take legal steps against Fifa, while Denmark say they have had internal discussions about withdrawing completely from the global governing body.
The reaction from LGBTQ+ groups has been mixed and included condemnation of Fifa and of the initial campaign as tokenistic. I cant speak for other countries and the decisions they make, and what they feel is the right way to protest any kind of social injustice they feel is being done, Irvine said on Thursday.
The OneLove armband is an interesting discussion in itself because conversations Ive had with people from the LGBTQI+ community have already described that messaging as vague and lacking a real kind of statement in what its actually trying to achieve as well.
So theres conversations we have from every angle about these things, but I cant speak on what other countries will decide to do and those discussions theyll have. Theyll make the decision that they feel is best for them.
In a statement of defiance against Fifa, Germanys players on Thursday placed hands over their mouths for their lineup picture and wore rainbow stripes on their warmup tops and boots before their Group E defeat against Japan. Their message was supported by the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who wore a OneLove armband as she sat next to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino.
Australias national team made their collective statement a fortnight before arriving in Qatar, releasing a video in which players raised concerns about the suffering of migrant workers and the inability for LGBTQ+ people in Qatar to love the person that they choose.
The clear position that we took coming into this tournament  there was no possibility to have that change thrown on us at a late stage, Irvine said. Thats why we chose to do that and the timing in which we did it as well. Its difficult to speak for those other countries. I know if I had to start on a card Id be in a right pickle, so I can totally understand how that affects different players.
But when you put yourself in a position where youve maybe not made your position totally clear and the gesture you have chosen to take, theres different circumstances come around that. Then it becomes difficult to react, especially in such a short space of time.
Irvine also referenced the human rights problems in Australia, a country with a terrible track record regarding Aboriginal deaths in custody and the disproportionately high incarceration numbers of First Nations people.
I hope its something as a team that we do continue to talk about, Irvine said. Ive commented in the past about problems we have at home, as much as the issues weve talked about here. Obviously us as players and being part of this tournament, we are so intrinsically linked to these issues at this time.

People talk about the hypocrisy talking about these issues and not talking about ones that happen at home, but I hope thats something that we continue to explore in the future and as part of our growth as a team and as individuals.
Meanwhile, the Football Australia chief executive, James Johnson, would not divulge whether his organisation would vote to re-elect Infantino, who is running unopposed in March, or join Denmark in pledging not to.
We are not in a position right now to decide that, because we dont have to, said Johnson, who previously worked with Infantino during his days as a former high-ranking Fifa official. At this stage I understand that its only president Infantino who will run, so Im not sure if therell be a decision to make, so to speak. In the event there was a contested election, we would ask the candidates what their vision is, what their priorities are and what their agenda is.
Johnson also defended Infantinos highly controversial pre-tournament press conference, saying he had been attempting to shift the narrative away from the political discussion around the World Cup.
He wanted to address it on the spot and then get everyone focused on the World Cup and the football, he said. I think Gianni is, at heart, a football person. Hes been in football his whole life. Thats always been my experience with him."

The DFB refused to let players in Qatar wear the armbands promoting diversity and inclusion after threats from the world football governing body to issue yellow cards to team captains, but faced a swift reaction, including from the supermarket chain REWE, which became the first sponsor to take direct action as it said it would drop its advertising campaign in protest at the decision.
The DFBs spokesperson, Stefan Simon, confirmed to the tabloid Bild that it had lodged a case over legal validity of the decision at the international sport court, CAS, in Lausanne.
Fifa has forbidden us from using a symbol of diversity and human rights. It said the ban would be linked to massive penalties (in the nature of) sporting sanctions without concretising exactly what it meant. The DFB is keen to clarify whether Fifas procedure is in fact legitimate, he said.
Simon said the DFB hoped to overturn the ban by the time of Germanys second match against Spain on Sunday, re-establishing its captain Manuel Neuers right to wear the OneLove symbol without facing penalties.
REWE in a statement before the DFB announced its legal action said it wanted to unambiguously distance itself from the position taken by Fifa and the statement made by its president, Gianni Infantino, at the weekend where he accused the west of hypocrisy in its reporting about Qatars human rights record.
Linoel Souque, the chief executive the Cologne-based retail chain, which has annual global sales of 76.5bn (£66bn), said the company could not accept Fifas stance. We stand for diversity and football is diversity. The scandalous behaviour of Fifa is for me as the CEO of a diverse company as well as a football fan absolutely unacceptable, he said.
The DFBs decision was made after Fifa threatened sanctions against its participating clubs, including issuing yellow cards to players, if they failed to comply. Germany, England, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Wales and Denmark all withdrew their plans to allow their captains to wear the armbands.
DFBs president, Bernd Neuendorf, said: In my opinion this is something of a display of power by Fifa. We see this as more than frustrating as well as being an unprecedented event in the history of the World Cup.
The telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom said on Tuesday it was planning to talk to the DFB, though did not say what action it might be prepared to take. Volkswagen, Adidas, Lufthansa and Commerzbank, the DFBs other commercial partners, are also under pressure to react.
The row reflects a generally downbeat and often angry mood in Germany towards the tournament being hosted in Qatar. Protests have included street demonstrations and one stadium lighting 20,000 candles at the weekend for Qatar migrant workers who have died, many in the process of building facilities for the World Cup.
Some German pubs and bars are refusing to show the tournament while others have announced they will donate the proceeds of their alcohol sales towards migrant worker charities.
REWE had told the DFB last month that it was not going to extend its years long contract with the DFB, but did not mention a connection with the World Cup.
The sticker album currently available at stores as well as the packets of stickers to go in it will be available for free with immediate effect, Souque said. Any money already made from sticker album sales will be donated to an appropriate cause, he added.
Souque said the supermarket nevertheless wished the German team well. Were on your side and are rooting for you, he said.
In surveys, more than half of Germans are in favour of boycotts of the World Cup, by spectators, sponsors and politicians. The majority have said they would not be watching matches on television and there has been much criticism towards the public broadcaster for paying around 200m for the broadcasting rights to show the tournament. Many politicians who had been scheduled to go to Qatar are now not doing so.
The real test of how feelings are among football fans will be Wednesday afternoons match between Japan and Germany.
Nancy Faeser, Germanys interior minister, called the armband ban a massive mistake by Fifa. It breaks the heart of every fan to see how Fifa is also putting the burden of this on to the shoulders of the players, she said.
Theo Zwanziger, a former DFB president, told Bild: Im happy that the DFB is now defending itself against the extraordinary machinations of Fifa president Gianni Infantino and is taking its case to the CAS. Anything else would have only done further damage to the credibility of the DFB, he said."

The gesture was gesture-trumped by Fifa, which gestured towards the referees pocket to indicate a yellow card would be forthcoming. Ahead of Englands World Cup opener against Iran yesterday, the Football Association put out a joint statement with other no-longer-participating nations, explaining we cant put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings. That including bookings really puts it into perspective. #ActivismIsHard.
Without wishing to undermine this heroically short-lived civil rights moment even further, what really is OneLove, with its off-brand Pride rainbow? The whole thing feels as weirdly and carefully vague as the bar orders of soap-opera characters, who walk into pubs and ask simply for a pint. A pint of what? OneLove of what?
So anodyne is the wider armband advocacy movement that it seems concerned above all else with not causing offence, to the point where it is impossible to imagine it sitting even very distantly on a continuum with sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carloss epic podium protest at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics (and the solidarity of the silver medallist, Peter Norman), or Muhammad Alis heroic career self-harm. Instead, #armbandgate feels perfectly contextualised in an era in which huge numbers of people became conveniently convinced that activism is something that happens in a web browser. After such a swift climbdown by the various nations, it would be nice to think the entire episode shows the absolute limits of this type of change-making.
Whenever I see people arguing hour after hour about their supposed causes on social media, I no longer even think of them as working in the service of those causes, but simply in the (perhaps unwitting) service of whichever Silicon Valley billionaire owns the digital space where theyre doing it. As serious tech experts have long pointed out, people stay longer on these platforms when theyre angry, so the best way to keep them there  where the techlords can monetise them  is for their algorithms to fan that anger. So thats what they do. Spent all day arguing about Jeremy Corbyn/Boris Johnson/whatever on Twitter? Hate to break it to you, but you dont work for your faction; you just work for Elon Musk. Try not to choke on it.
Speaking of overlords, we must conclude that Fifa president Gianni Infantino did not feel gay yesterday. On Saturday, Infantino gave a speech in which he said he did feel gay, and disabled, and like a migrant worker, because  I think I have this right  people teased him about his red hair when he was a child. This put me in mind of the late football pundit Jimmy Hills insistence that the N-word was funny. Why should that be any more of an offence, Hill wondered idiotically, than someone calling me chinny? It was the year 2004 at the time  and, even more incredibly, not a whole lot seems to have changed in Zurichs corridors of power today.
As for what I suppose well have to characterise as the FAs thinking on all this, there are really only two possibilities. The first is that they knew very well Fifa would prohibit it, because they always do, so always planned to fold at the first sign of threat (which they did). The second is that they literally didnt even realise this was how it would play out, in which case I do hope their football campaign for this tournament is better strategised, otherwise its going to fall apart at the first sign of trouble.
In a modern game in which theyre everywhere, there is something very will-this-do about armbands in general. They feel like little more than a hashtag-heavy social media template. You retweet it, you undo the retweet. You make a big show of wearing it, then you discard it the minute youre threatened with a yellow. Easy come, easy go.
It seems strange to have to state this, when historically it was axiomatic: but true activism typically involves rather higher stakes than this, and at the very least the potential for some kind of personal sacrifice. As we can see from the hugely perilous collectivist endeavours unfolding in Iran, it is rather harder work to refuse to wear the hijab than it is to be banned from wearing the armband. No one is remotely saying that England players need to take to the streets and risk their lives for a cause they say they truly believe in. But taking a yellow is arguably doable  and if it honestly isnt, then dont even bother trailing the gesture in the first place. Its an insult to those who do seriously put themselves out.
Putting yourself out cuts different ways, of course, some of them also ridiculous. David Beckhams rumoured 150m pieces of silver to promote Qatar is unquestionably a piece of activism, and is  regrettably  worth more than countless armbands. You can even see it has involved David laying down some of his personal desires for the cause. Scowling down from the dignitaries seats at the tournament, Beckham has been wearing the expression of a man who knows hes never going to get his knighthood now. Im sure the Qatari regime thanks him for his sacrifice.
Sacrifices that dont benefit you are harder. Structural change requires structural action, and plastic gestures will generate plastic results. England and any other nations who genuinely wish to take a stand could still come up with a better form of protest at this World Cup. There is plenty of time for creative collective action  but is there truly the will?

The Dutch were one of seven European teams, including England and Wales, who planned for their captains to wear the rainbow?coloured OneLove armband at the World Cup.
The band is part of a year-long campaign but would have sent an especially significant message in Qatar, which criminalises same?sex relationships. But the seven countries dropped their plans after Fifa threatened them with sporting sanctions including yellow cards for the captains if the bands were worn, instructing teams to wear a Fifa?approved no discrimination band instead.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
After the 2-0 win against Senegal on Monday, the Netherlands captain, Van Dijk, told the Dutch broadcaster NOS: I play in a position where a yellow card is not useful. I became a football player and I want to play these kind of tournaments. There are people who say we dont have a backbone, but thats not how it works. 
We just want to play football. I would have loved to play with that band, but not at the expense of a yellow card.
The England captain, Harry Kane, said he was disappointed not to be able to wear the band during his teams opening win against Iran on Monday, while his teammate Jack Grealish said it was a bit stupid that Kane had been prevented from doing so.
The Football Association had been prepared to be fined over the band but its position  and that of the other associations  changed when it became apparent sporting sanctions were a possibility.

Fifa has been heavily criticised over the matter. It announced its plan for an approved armband on Saturday, and even then said the no discrimination part of its campaign would only begin at the quarter-final stage. Instead on Monday that position shifted. It followed a late U-turn on alcohol sales within stadium perimeters last Friday.
Wales supporters alleged rainbow-coloured items were confiscated before their match against the USA on Monday, including Laura McAllister, who last year stood for election to the Fifa Council. She tweeted: So, despite fine words from FIFAWorldCup before event Cymru rainbow bucket hats confiscated at stadium, mine included.
I had a conversation about this with stewards  we have video evidence. This WorldCup2022 just gets better but we will continue stand up for our values.
Fifa is understood to have had assurances from the Qatari authorities before the tournament that supporters would be able to wear rainbow-coloured clothing and carry rainbow-coloured banners and flags."

In Mondays match against Iran, Englands Harry Kane wore an armband reading no discrimination, in black and white  which, despite its stated message, meant more cold-shoulder treatment for lesbian, gay, bi and trans people at this World Cup.
When it was announced back in September that eight competing nations would support the One Love campaign, with multicoloured hearts appearing on captains sleeves, the power of the gesture lay in allyship. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching, said Kane.
The six colours being used for One Love arent those of the Pride rainbow, but that made sense in the context of Qatar. After all, the criminalisation of same-sex love is not the only human rights issue in the host nation. But even then, One Love never did feel alright  and its weaknesses were ultimately exposed by Fifas bullying tactics and Englands risk-averse response.
Cracks in the coalition started to appear when the France skipper, Hugo Lloris, said last week that respect for Qatars rules and culture meant he was unlikely to wear the armband. He also suggested he was waiting for the final call from Fifa, which then stopped the remaining seven teams with the threat of sanctioning their skippers if they wore the campaign apparel.
Kane ended up wearing an armband approved by world footballs governing body instead. Meanwhile, Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain, sported a different design  but again, Fifa-approved and anodyne  when his team played Senegal on Monday afternoon.
I run a network called Sports Media LGBT+ for those working in sports media who are LGBTQ+ (we have more than 50 in our core group) and the ping of WhatsApp messages on Monday morning was testament to the way hearts were sinking.
We are collectively exasperated at our community being seen as political. Fifas own statutes include sexual orientation in its non-discrimination, equality and neutrality clause, but it appears visibility and a reference to love is still a stretch too far. Its why Sports Media LGBT+ is among the supporters of the No Pride Without All campaign launched by Three Lions Pride, the Rainbow Wall and Pride in Football.
Members of these LGBTQ+ fan groups have not travelled to Qatar  they did not receive adequate reassurances of security for fans, while they also wanted to show solidarity with their queer Qatari siblings.
They feel similarly deflated by the overruling of One Love. Their statement reads: Fifa are guilty of crushing the basic human rights to freedom of speech and of expression that every single one of us should have without question.
Kane could, of course, have worn the One Love armband anyway, and taken the booking or whatever punishment Fifa intended to dish out  but, amid so much uncertainty just hours before kickoff, the FA erred on the side of caution.
The players and staff of the national teams involved were put in a near impossible position. Ultimately, Fifas failings during the whole affair  exemplified by the insensitive manner in which its president, Gianni Infantino, referenced diversity in his address to the media on the eve of the tournament  has undermined the very values it professes to share, and that are written into the non-discrimination clause of its statutes.
Fifa seems to believe that by mandating usage of its own armbands, it is showing leadership. But with seven out of eight groups at this World Cup containing nations where homosexuality is still illegal, there simply isnt a shared commitment on LGBTQ+ inclusion.
The visibility of One Love might have at least started a specific conversation, and perhaps we shall discover that Fifas actions have made it even more of a talking point.
The only person seen wearing the armband at England v Iran was, commendably, the BBC pundit Alex Scott, who has recently written in her autobiography about her previous relationship with her former teammate Kelly Smith.
She was representing LGBTQ+ people from the sidelines. Its where our community will no doubt continue to find itself during this mens World Cup.

Fears that captains could receive an instant booking for wearing the armband prompted the move, and LGBTQ+ groups reacted with fury at authorities preventing teams from promoting diversity during an increasingly farcical World Cup.
Seven European nations scrapped plans to continue with the OneLove campaign after hours of uncertainty and Kane was instead ordered to wear Fifas anti-discrimination armband when Gareth Southgates side opened their campaign in Qatar by thrashing Iran.

Were disappointed, Kane said. I said yesterday we wanted to wear it. That decision was taken out of my hands today. I turned up to the stadium with the armband that I wore and I was told I had to wear that [the official Fifa one]. Its out of our control as players. Im sure the FA and Fifa will continue those discussions but most importantly today we focused on the game and got a great result.
Kane said England, who took the knee before facing Iran, will continue to do their best to speak out against injustice. Youve seen over the last five years weve made a stand as a squad and well continue to do that as much as we can. We took the knee today as well but sometimes these decisions arent up to us and thats the bottom line.
Southgate refused to condemn Fifas behaviour and said teams should be allowed to focus on their performances. The armband, its not something myself or the players have been involved in over the last 24 hours, Englands head coach said.
These discussions have been ongoing between several European nations and Fifa.
I actually do understand Fifas situation, in that you can set a precedent and then its very difficult where you draw the line. So I think in an ideal world that would have been a much clearer situation earlier but its not something thats been a distraction.
We said yesterday we need to focus on the football. People know this group of players are taking the knee because its something we feel we can make a difference with. There are some things Im not sure we are going to be able to make a difference with and therefore we should channel our energies in the right direction.
I think every coach now deserves the right to be able to focus on the football. We understand there are issues that people want us to speak about. Weve done that for the last 12 months. But this is a World Cup. We wont refuse to answer any questions. But the predominant part of our energy has to be on preparing the team. There are other people at our federation who have to deal with those issues because its not the responsibility of the players.

A place they will not be taken, a line that will not be crossed, a point at which they bend and break. And as Englands footballers peeled off their smart blue training jackets a few minutes before 4pm local time at the Khalifa International Stadium, perhaps we discovered theirs.
They really, really wanted to wear the armband. Perhaps was the main thing. Indeed that was the thrust of the Football Associations statement issued about an hour before kick-off in their opening World Cup game against Iran, in which it declared it was very frustrated with Fifas ban on the little strip of elastane that had been unveiled with such proud fanfare in advance of the tournament. On reflection, maybe the real armband was the press releases it issued along the way.
And so, farewell to the OneLove armband. We never really knew you. Certainly we didnt know what you were for. LGBTQ+ rights, we think. Maybe a bit of anti-racism too? Some gender equality, some disability rights, and maybe a little bit of migrant worker feels thrown in there too. None of this, of course, was specifically mentioned in the promotional literature.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
Meanwhile the time-honoured rainbow design of traditional LGBTQ+ allyship was eschewed in favour of red, black, green, pink, yellow and blue stripes, which is the sort of rainbow children draw when they dont know what colours are.
The official intention was to promote inclusion and send a message against discrimination of any kind, a mission statement of such magnificent vagueness that it is impossible to imagine a single cogent argument against it. You couldnt object to the OneLove armband because it didnt really exist. It was essentially designed as an empty vessel, a weightless piece of branding, the fabric equivalent of the shrug emoji. It wasnt nothing. But it was probably the next best thing.
And yet given English footballs predilection for fixating on nothing, perhaps it was no surprise that OneLove became something of a cause célèbre among the English media in Qatar, particularly when word got out that Fifa was thinking of banning it. Much like the fuss over the taking of the knee in 2021, where the discourse over the gesture overshadowed any of the causes or issues the gesture was highlighting, press conferences and off-record briefings were lit with feverish armband chatter.
Would it be an automatic booking for Harry Kane? What if he refused to take the armband off? Could someone else  maybe Jordan Pickford  wear the armband instead? And would England ultimately defy the bloodless bureaucrats of Zurich and stand up for the cause they believed in, whatever it was? Well, of course not. As soon as the threat of sporting sanctions was brandished  no, please, not the sporting sanctions  England and their international comrades-in-arms simply quivered into line.
An armband that was already a form of surrender was now being folded into a larger surrender. And although the official communication came from Fifa, the armband ban really comes from the same place as the 11th hour ban on stadium beer: a naked last-minute Qatari power move, an assertion of control and ownership, insubordinates being nudged into line with a bloody stick.
The argument is that condemnation should not fall on Englands players, who did not impose this ban and who bear no direct responsibility for the moral cost of this World Cup. And yet just across the halfway line, there was a very different concept of what it means to be an athlete for your country in 2022.
As the Iranian national anthem played before the game, not a single word was sung by any of Irans players in defiance of the countrys brutal crackdown on protesters. Women are being beaten in the streets. Men are being dragged into police stations and killed. Human rights groups estimate that about 400 demonstrators have been murdered.
Not all of Irans players have spoken out against the violence. But those who have, including the star striker Sardar Azmoun, do so in the knowledge that sporting sanctions are the least of their worries. And really the true measure of activism is in what you are prepared to give up.
Muhammad Ali protested against the Vietnam war even though he knew he would be arrested, stripped of his world titles, robbed of his prime years. Irans players have risked unemployment, humiliation, imprisonment, threats against their families from a depraved autocratic regime. England have shown that they are not even prepared to risk a yellow card.
There are two World Cups happening in Qatar over the next month. The Khalifa International hosted a terrific game of football on Monday. The outside of the stadium was emblazoned with slogans such as Celebrate and Live it All. Once the game began, the goals poured like rain. Each England goal was punctuated by a blast of Freed From Desire, and the England fans  those who had paid to be there and those who had not  jumped up and down as if they were having the best time of their lives.
This is the World Cup that Fifa and Qatar want everyone to talk about and enjoy. Skyscrapers festooned in Kylian Mbappé posters, stadiums bouncing to ear-splitting music, a din so loud you can no longer hear the screaming of those who suffered to make this happen. Yes, there are two World Cups happening here. England have decided they only want to play in one of them."

Her decision to wear the OneLove armband  which officially represents a stand against all forms of discrimination  came hours after the England and Wales teams decided not to wear the same armbands after being informed that players could receive yellow cards for breaching Fifa rules on clothing.
Scotts decision to wear the armband was the latest element of the BBCs World Cup coverage to be openly critical of the host nation. It follows the corporations decision not to air Sundays opening ceremony  an elaborate performance featuring Morgan Freeman and the K-pop singer Jungkook  on its main broadcast channel. Millions of BBC One viewers instead saw an extended series of discussions and films criticising Qatars human rights record and treatment of migrant workers.
The BBC said the opening ceremony was still available to watch on an online iPlayer feed, while the host Gary Lineker said the change was influenced by the BBCs desire to show a Womens Super League game between Chelsea and Tottenham.
The Match of the Day presenter said: Its not customary for us to show any World Cup or Euros opening ceremonies in their entirety on BBC One, but do make it available to view on BBC iPlayer, red button and website. Very different, of course, for the Olympics.
Despite the criticism of Qatar, the allure of free televised football remained strong for the British public. A peak audience of 8 million viewers tuned in for the opening game of the World Cup, in which the hosts, Qatar, lost 2-0 to Ecuador in a turgid match. These overnight ratings, provided by Digital-ido, do not include people watching in public spaces such as pubs or those watching online streams.
The viewing figures for Englands 6-2 demolition of Iran on Monday afternoon are likely to have been substantially higher, with the BBCs iPlayer streaming service struggling to cope with demand  potentially driven by the large number of people trying to watch the match on their work computers or on mobile phones.
iPlayer has a lengthy lag compared with traditional television  an issue the broadcaster has been working to fix for several years  meaning some viewers were learning about goals from social media and app push alerts before they had seen them on their screens."

row  as it happened","England and Wales have backed down on wearing an armband supporting the LGBTQ+ community while playing in Qatar after the threat of sporting sanctions was raised by Fifa.
In a joint statement with Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the football associations of England and Wales said:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Fifa has been very clear that it will impose sporting sanctions if our captains wear the armbands on the field of play. As national federations, we cant put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings, so we have asked the captains not to attempt to wear the armbands in Fifa World Cup games.
We were prepared to pay fines  however we cannot put out players in the situation where they might be booked or even forced to leave the field of play.
The statement goes on to say We are very frustrated by the Fifa decision which we believe is unprecedented and that our players and coaches are disappointed  they are strong supporters of inclusion and will show support in other ways.
The national associations had written to Fifa about their intention to wear the armbands in September, but heard nothing back. The armbands were worn with little fanfare or reaction from Fifa in Septembers Nations League fixtures.
Ok, that is your lot from me today. Scott Murray has all the action coming up for England v Iran. Do join him 
England coach Gareth Southgate has just been interviewed on the BBC and asked about the armband situation. He told viewers:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}A lot of discussion has been going on without me involved, because Ive been focused on the game. We are wearing the Fifa armbands. That was decided by the collective federations overnight I believe. We are in the middle of that, were just really trying to focus on the game, frankly,
PA Media have interviewed some England fans about the armband ban, and the verdict of at least one was that the FA have bottled it.
England fan Steve Wright, 43, from Derby, when informed of the decision, told the PA news agency: I disagree with that. Theyre just bowing to the oppression of the Qatari government.
Qatari sources have told the Guardian that this was entirely down to Fifa, and not the hosts.
Shaun Rowland, 56, from Hertfordshire, also speaking outside the Khalifa International Stadium ahead of Englands game with Iran, said: Theyve bottled it, havent they? Would it have made a massive difference? I dont know, I think its a shame.
Simon Hill, 55, from near Cambridge, added: Focus on the football.Terry Woolf, 52, from Hitchin, said: What a surprise, in response to the decision. He added: I think theyve tried to sensationalise a lot of it when it was quite meaningless when they were going to do (it), it didnt have any real impact.
Shane Jackson, 33, from Malvern, Worcestershire, added: Theyre going to take the knee as well before the game, I think Harry Kane shouldnt have the burden on him - of being booked, should I wear it, should we focus on the football. The political stuff should be left behind.
I know theyve put their thoughts out on it, but let the players concentrate on the football now.
Jamie Jackson reports from the Germany camp in Doha:
Jamal Musiala has stated that the motto of play with freedom he learned when representing Englands youth teams remains his inspiration before Germanys World Cup campaign.
The Stuttgart-born 19-year-old moved aged seven to London and he went to school there and played for England youth teams before deciding to represent Germany at senior level. The Bayern Munich midfielder is conscious of how vital his formative years were.
In the England youth teams you learn different things than you do playing in Germany, said Musiala. I took home many messages. It was a different environment the England youth setup.

The 3LionsPride group of England LGBT supporters have strongly condemned Fifas actions today in a statement, saying Fifa are guilty of crushing the basic human rights to freedom of speech and of expression that everyone of us should have without question.
They go on to accuse Fifa of silencing anti-discrimination work in the game and giving a platform to hatred.

Here are the England and Iran teams for today. So I was wrong about them appearing at noon GMT, but correct that Grealish doesnt start:
England: Jordan Pickford, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Kieran Trippier, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Mason Mount, Luke Shaw, Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling
Iran: Alireza Beiranvand, Sadegh Moharrami, Ehsan Hajsafi, Milad Mohammadi, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Morteza Pouraliganji, Mehdi Taremi, Rouzbeh Cheshmi, Ali Karimi, Majid Hosseini, Ahmad Nourollahi

Joe Lycett has just revealed a little more about the stunt where he threatened to shred £10,000 unless David Beckham severed his relationship with promoting the Qatar World Cup. Worth watching with the sound up, this one.

Nathan Fisher writes to tell me that he is over 20% certain that he has a solution for Richard Norths iPlayer dilemma. [See 11.30 GMT]
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Your man can open the link to the match on the BBC site just before kick-off, then leave it open in his tabs. When hes ready to watch it, he can just press the watch from start button. Im over 20% certain this will work. In the meantime, stay inside a lead-walled safe room to avoid catching the score anywhere.
In the words of Joe Lycett, I think youre reassured. Im reassured.
One place you will definitely find out the score is with Scott Murray over on our England v Iran MBM which is already underway. Here is Scotts take on the game:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}England should be too good for Iran. But then everyone said the same about Scotland in 1978 and the USA two decades later. At the last two World Cups, Iran gave Argentina, Spain and Portugal a game. More pertinently, Carlos Queirozs 2022 version have recently beaten hipster-dark-horses Uruguay and African champions Senegal. They dont concede too many, so given Englands recent net-finding travails  plus the Three Lions habit of starting World Cups slowly ­ Iran may fancy their chances of opening Group B by springing a surprise. Kick off is at 1pm GMT, 4pm at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha.
My own expectations of todays matches, for what it is worth, is a narrow uninspiring win for England that raises more questions than answers, an entertaining draw from the Netherlands v Senegal who will surely both assume they will each win their other two games. And Im afraid Ive got Wales v USA down as a 0-0.
Incidentally Fifa have given this reasoning for the OneLove armband decision: This is in line with Article 13.8.1 of the FIFA Equipment Regulations, which state: For FIFA Final Competitions, the captain of each Team must wear the captains armband provided by FIFA.
It remains entirely unclear why they did not make that point back in September when the nations wanting to show their support of the LGBTQ+ community in Qatar and beyond wrote to Fifa to say they were planning to wear the armbands and got no response.
Do you remember club football? I think we were still doing that last weekend, werent we? Anyway, the board at Glasgow Rangers certainly do, and have decided theyve run out of patience with Giovanni van Bronckhorst and have binned him off this morning, hoping nobody would notice because we are busy with the World Cup.
Excitingly we are now just thirty minutes from England naming their line-up for their opening World Cup match, which means we are about 31 minutes from Why isnt he playing Jack Grealish trending on what is left of Twitter.
Richard North emails me, with the hope that the vast knowledge of the combined mass of Guardian readers will furnish him with an answer. He is Likely Lads style  hoping to avoid the England v Iran score, and then watch it as live, but for some reason isnt just going to tape it on the vintage VHS machine he surely has lurking up in the loft. He asks:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Im planning to watch the game as live later this evening, but how best to do this given BBCs frustrating lack of information as to when exactly the game will be available on iPlayer and just how long you can pause the live-channel watch option on iPlayer for (i.e. will it really just work as normal potentially five hours after you pause at kick-off??)
The answer is surely just to follow it on our minute-by-minute, and then flick through the highlights later? Or read our how to watch the World Cup at work guide? I am here for another half-hour yet, so if you do have any helpful suggestions for Richards conundrum, you can drop me an email at martin.belam@theguardian.com
Reuters has a little more from the France media briefing today. The defending champions start their campaign in Group D on Tuesday, looking to beat the Socceroos just like they did to kick off their 2018 journey in Russia in a 2-1 match that saw the first ever decision in a World Cup via VAR.
Captain Hugo Lloris insisted the team would cope with the late withdrawal of Karim Benzema, saying We still believe in our chances, in our squad. The last-minute withdrawals, especially Karims, did not help. But I want to think that the team will move on.
Coach Didier Deschamps is likely to start veteran Olivier Giroud as a lone forward. Lately hes been adored. France is delighted, Im delighted and so is Olivier, said Deschamps.
Deschamps said that centre back Raphael Varane has shaken off a hamstring injury and will be available for the reigning champions tomorrow. He is doing well, Deschamps said.
Amid the armband furore, we shouldnt lose sight of the fact that todays match against England is highly politically charged for Iran, coming against the backdrop of major protests in the country.
The BBCs Iranian-born journalist Mani Djazmi reports that some Iranians at the game today plan to boo the national anthem.
As the first game of the day approaches, some Iran fans tell me they plan to boo the Iranian anthem. https://t.co/DxlACeT79C
He interviewed some Iranian fans late last night in Qatar. One told him that We used to use football to be happy, to find some sort of glory in the football. But nowadays, it makes no sense for us to be happy anymore.
Another expressed disappointment with the stance of the Iranian team, saying We are here to support just the people of Iran, not the soccer team, because we didnt see any action from them to support Iranian people. Were waiting for them at the first game to just do some actions to support the Iranian people. If they dont do anything, were not supporting the Iranian team.
Bryan Armen Graham is in Doha for the Guardian keeping a keen eye on the USA:
United States coach Gregg Berhalter while refusing to tip his hand, indicated that his team selection was pretty much done for Mondays Group B opener at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, a renovated 44,000-seat venue roughly 10 miles west of Doha. After describing Wales as an underrated team with a wealth of difference-making players and experience in international competitions, he also intimated that his choices will reflect a proactive desire to play for the result, aware that only eight of 73 teams that lost their opening match at the previous six World Cups have gone on to reach the knockout stage.
Were looking at the game in its entirety and thinking about how we can be successful, Berhalter said. We want to be an aggressive team in this game. We want to be able to hurt them, but we also know that they have strengths and they have threats and we want to be able to take them away.
So when picking a lineup, weve focused on guys that we think can execute it from the onset, but also keeping in mind that our [substitutions] are going to be really important in this game and throughout the World Cup. We know that its not just the 11 on the field, were going to need the solutions to come into the field and help this group get the win.

The Football Supporters Association (FSA) has issued a response to todays developments with Fifa forcing European football associations to back down from wearing captains armbands with a supportive message for the LGBTQ+ community under the threat of issuing sporting sanctions rather than fines.
The FSA statement says To paraphrase Fifa president Gianni Infantino - today LGBT+ football supporters and their allies will feel angry. Today we feel betrayed. Today we feel contempt for an organisation that has shown its true values by giving the yellow card to players and the red card to tolerance.
Never again should a World Cup be handed out solely on the basis of money and infrastructure. No country which falls short on LGBT+ rights, womens rights, workers rights or any other universal human right should be given the honour of hosting a World Cup.
Since 2010 we have been raising questions about the suitability of Qatar as a World Cup host. Everyone could see this coming and its astonishing that, on the morning of Englands World Cup opener, Fifa are censoring players and the nine national FAs  including the FA and FAW  who wish to share a positive message.
Away from armbands for a moment, Poland will open their World Cup campaign against Mexico tomorrow, and Louise Taylor has profiled the legend that is Robert Lewandowski:
Playing for Poland definitely carries massive pressure, agrees a striker hoping to guide his country to victory against Mexico in their opening group game on Tuesday. Im acutely conscious of the responsibility of meeting our fans expectations. They grow with every goal. No matter who were playing and what challenges we face, everyone expects me to score  but its not always easy.
He will be shouldering the hopes of, among others, half the clientele of LAutre, a Polish-Mexican restaurant in Londons Mayfair who know a win would appreciably enhance Czeslaw Michniewiczs teams chances of escaping the tournaments group stage for the first time in 36 years. An evocative photograph of Argentina 1978 hangs proudly on LAutres wall, depicting the scenes when the two countries last met at a World Cup and Poland won 3-1.
Given Lewandowskis age, a repeat could offer him not merely a ticket out of a group also featuring Argentina and Saudi Arabia but an extended last hurrah on the global stage. I dont think this will be my last World Cup though, says a player clearly minded to rage against the dying of the light. I want to play in the next one too.
Given that Lewangoalski has scored 18 times in 19 appearance for Barcelona this season and remains feted in Germany  where he played under Jürgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund and Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich  it would be unwise to doubt him.

Andy Hunter reports from the France media briefing this morning in Doha:
France captain Hugo Lloris has said it was the responsibility of Fifa, not footballers, to decide whether the OneLove armband should be worn at the World Cup in support of the LGBTQ+ community.
England, Wales and five other European nations have backed down on wearing the armband following a threat of sporting sanctions from world footballs governing body.
Lloris never intended to wear a OneLove armband out of respect, he had said previously, for the culture in Qatar. And the captain of a country with close political and economic ties to Qatar said he would prefer to fall in line with Fifas instructions.
The Tottenham goalkeeper said on Monday: Fifa is organising this competition and it is up to Fifa to put in play a regulatory framework. Us players are here to play football and represent our countries as best we can from a sporting front. Id prefer to stay in my box, Im a player and Im here to play football. There are different causes that should be supported but it is up to Fifa to take decisions regarding the organisation of the tournament.
Here is a reminder that only yesterday the England camp were still very much in favour of wearing the OneLove armband, which they, along with the other nations planning to wear it, have now been forced to back down on.
In yesterdays media appearance, Englands captain Harry Kane said Weve made it clear as a team, and the staff, as an organisation, that we want to wear the armband. I know the FA are talking to Fifa at the moment and Im sure by game time tomorrow theyll have their decision. But yeah, I feel weve made it clear that we want to wear it.
Coach Gareth Southgate said Theres nothing I can add to what Harry said. I know there are some conversations going on. I think a number of the European countries have spoken, and weve made our position clear. So hopefully everything will be resolved before before the game.
It has been resolved, and Fifa have forced the football associations into backing down with the threat of sporting sanctions. Instead the captains presumably will wear the Fifa-mandated message for matchday one  Football unites the world. If any of the nations reach the quarter-finals the Fifa-mandated armband message for that match is due to be #NoDiscrimination.
David Hytner, Ben Fisher and Nick Ames in Doha have pulled together this fuller report on the latest armband development:
England, Wales and five other European nations have confirmed they will not wear the OneLove armband at the World Cup in Qatar, saying Fifa made clear they would face sporting sanctions and that their captains could be booked or even forced to leave the pitch.
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland were the other countries that had planned to wear the rainbow armband in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal. Fifa has ordered all captains to wear armbands that promote other social messages.
A joint statement from the seven football federations said: Fifa has been very clear that it will impose sporting sanctions if our captains wear the armbands on the field of play. As national federations, we cant put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings, so we have asked the captains not to attempt to wear the armbands in Fifa World Cup games.
We were prepared to pay fines that would normally apply to breaches of kit regulations and had a strong commitment to wearing the armband. However, we cannot put our players in the situation where they might be booked or even forced to leave the field of play.
We are very frustrated by the Fifa decision which we believe is unprecedented  we wrote to Fifa in September informing them of our wish to wear the One Love armband to actively support inclusion in football, and had no response. Our players and coaches are disappointed  they are strong supporters of inclusion and will show support in other ways.
England and Wales have backed down on wearing an armband supporting the LGBTQ+ community while playing in Qatar after the threat of sporting sanctions was raised by Fifa.
In a joint statement with Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the football associations of England and Wales said:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Fifa has been very clear that it will impose sporting sanctions if our captains wear the armbands on the field of play. As national federations, we cant put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings, so we have asked the captains not to attempt to wear the armbands in Fifa World Cup games.
We were prepared to pay fines  however we cannot put out players in the situation where they might be booked or even forced to leave the field of play.
The statement goes on to say We are very frustrated by the Fifa decision which we believe is unprecedented and that our players and coaches are disappointed  they are strong supporters of inclusion and will show support in other ways.
The national associations had written to Fifa about their intention to wear the armbands in September, but heard nothing back. The armbands were worn with little fanfare or reaction from Fifa in Septembers Nations League fixtures.
A brief update on the armband situation comes from Sean Ingle in Doha. He has spoken to two Qatari sources who maintain this is purely a Fifa decision, and that there has been no pressure from their side regarding the rainbow armband.
Darren Chetty writes for the Guardian about the conflicting emotions of waiting all your life to see your team at the World Cup, but then it comes when the tournament is in Qatar:
I have mixed feelings about this tournament, as will a lot of people. Many have raised concerns for LGBTQ+ fans wishing to travel to Qatar for the tournament, given the countrys draconian laws banning homosexuality and the recent homophobic comments from a Qatari ambassador for the World Cup. Ive seen far less written about the safety of gay players, however; perhaps this betrays the broader homophobia within the mens game, which is still far from an environment where players can safely be out.
2022 qualification is shaping up to be a cultural moment for Wales. The camaraderie among the players and the close bond to the Red Wall, as the fans on the stands are known, has been building for well over a decade now, helped no doubt by an unprecedented period of success on the pitch, but also by the Football Association of Wales, which often feels like an extension of the fanbase. Frequent references to Cymru indicate a newfound pride taken in Cymraeg. Bucket hats, vintage shirts, Zombie Nation, Yma O Hyd; Welsh football fandom these days comes with its own look and its own sound.

Just a little more from the Cristiano Ronaldo media briefing  he said he had a feeling that Portugal will do well, but named four other favourites. He told reporters:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}Brazil, Argentina, France, Germany are the teams that tend to have the most chances. However, at Euro 2016 nobody gave any thought to Portugal and we won. There may be surprises and I hope that this time there will be too.
It would be magical, a dream. Winning a World Cup would be a dream and we are here to achieve that goal. Everyone is here to achieve this goal.
Croatias Andrej Kramari? has been up in front of the media, and said he has been pleasantly surprised by conditions in Qatar and isnt fazed by the World Cup being mid-season. Reuters quotes the 1899 Hoffenheim player saying:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}The conditions here have been better than I expected, the conditions are a little bit windy. And considering the air conditioning in the stadiums, it will even get cold during the games.
Regarding the tournaments timing, a winter World Cup, its great actually, were not tired and its not the end of the season. So I think we will see a burst of energy from a physical standpoint during this World Cup, which I think is going to be fiery.
Kramari?, who has 74 caps for Croatia, said he backed Brazil to win the tournament though he hoped that Lionel Messi would get a chance to lift the trophy.
I think 95% of players would agree Messi is the greatest player to ever play this game, I dont think well see a player like Messi again, he said  dont tell CR7  So Im cheering in that regard for Argentina, but I think Brazil will win.
Nick Ames has this from the Denmark camp on the ongoing row over the OneLove armbands:
The Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand said he will protect his players from the decision-making process surrounding the rainbow armband controversy and will not ask captain, Simon Kjaer, to begin the competition with the disadvantage of a yellow card.
Denmark and Kjaer had, alongside the likes of England and Wales, planned to defy Fifa and wear the armband against Tunisia tomorrow but the suggestion that referees may be obliged to book players who do so may bring a rethink.
First of all I think its not up to the players, Hjulmand said. Imagine going on the pitch with a clear yellow card to start with: thats not possible and we have to make sure its not up to the players to make that decision.
Sporting sanctions, not only economic sanctions but something that is to do with results  we cant ask the players to go on the pitch with that. Its the federations decision.
Hjulmand said he expects a decision on the stance to take will be made collectively with the other countries concerned later today. He also made clear his bafflement at Fifas attitude given the armband was worn, with scant fanfare, during Nations League games in September.
This is not something invented for this occasion, its something weve done before, he said. A One Love armband  I cant see the problem to be honest. For me its also a big question mark.
It is not just England in talks with Fifa over the OneLove armband, with Wales and the rest of the Football Associations planning for their captains to wear it in a show of support against anti-discrimination and for LGBTQ+ communities locked in talks with the tournament organisers.
Wales had maintained on Sunday that Gareth Bale would wear the rainbow-coloured armband as planned but it remains to be seen if they are spooked by the possibility of their star player being booked for doing so. Denmark, Germany and Switzerland are among the countries also set to wear the armband. A statement clarifying the situation is expected before England take on Iran.
Here is David Hytner with a fuller report on the latest developments with England, the FA and the OneLove armband:
The Football Association have confirmed that Harry Kane could be booked if he wears the OneLove armband in Mondays World Cup opener against Iran and they are exploring other ways in which they could show support to the LGBTQ+ community.
The row with Fifa erupted on Sunday when it was suggested that referees could be left with no option but to show a yellow card to captains who wear the armband in Qatar, where same-sex relationships are illegal. Fifa has ordered all captains to wear armbands that promote other social messages.
The FA met with Fifa this morning and they continue to seek clarity over the possible sporting sanctions for Kane, who has made it clear that he wants to wear the armband. The FA wrote to Fifa in September to outline their intentions only to receive no response. They had resolved to accept a fine if Kane wore the armband but Mark Bullingham, the FAs chief executive, told BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning that the situation had now changed.
It is a very live situation, Bullingham said. There are discussions that are carrying on. We are working through those issues right now. It is true to say that Fifa did indicate yesterday that there could be sporting sanctions. Thats obviously something that we have to work through.
My colleague Jamie Jackson in Doha has a little more from that Cristiano Ronaldo media appearance:
Cristiano Ronaldo was speaking at his nations World Cup training base for the first time since the allegations he made against United that have caused the club to explore potential legal action against the forward.
Ronaldo described himself as bullet proof and denied there was friction with Bruno Fernandes, his United and Portugal teammate. A video of them together when joining up for the World Cup caused a view that there may be.
Ronaldo said: I was playing around. His plane was late  I asked him: Did you come by boat?
Portugal play their first game against Ghana on Thursday and Ronaldo said he was feeling great and that Portugal, winners of Euro 2016, were capable of securing a first World Cup.
Former Welsh international Clayton Blackmore has been giving his thoughts on Group B on Sky News this morning. He is thrilled that Wales have qualified, having narrowly missed out himself on occasions. He told viewers:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}We got close, but we just couldnt get over the line. But its magnificent that theyve got there, and they are there on merit. Weve got some great players. Gareth Bales coming to the end of his career  hes got a few years left  but we need our top players. And the young lads, weve got a really good blend of players, and Im really excited about it.
Blackmore, who made 39 appearances for Wales, confessed that he would supporting England against Iran, saying we need England to win their first two games, adding of Wales prospect:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}I think its really important today that the game against USA, they need to win it. Its not the end of the world if they draw, or they need something out of the next two games, but we dont want to go into the England game, you know, needing something.
One advantage of doing the World Cup live blog is that I cant get into trouble for thinking about the World Cup while I am at work. Not everybody is so lucky. Josh Halliday presents this guide to watching the football on the sly while you are at work, which of course, the Guardian does not endorse.
The FAs chief executive has indicated that England may back down from wearing the planned One Love armbands in the face of potential sanctions from Fifa that go beyond a fine.
FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham speaking on BBC Radio 4, described it as a very live situation. He told listeners:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}There are discussions that are carrying on. We are working through those issues right now. It is true to say that Fifa did indicated yesterday that there could be sporting sanctions, thats obviously something that we have to work through. We have been clear that we want to wear the armband. It is important to us. But equally we need to work through all of the discussions right now and see where we end up. Is it a risk for Kane to wear the armband? Thats what were working through right now.
Weve had meetings this morning with Fifa are there are discussions carrying on. As Ive said we are very keen to wear the armband, we want to do it but obviously we would need to consider the implications. Normally in this kind of situation there would be a fine that would get paid and weve always said wed be very happy to do that. Well, happy might be the wrong word but wed be prepared to pay the fine because we think its important to show our support for inclusion. If the sporting sanctions threat is real then we need to look at that, we need to step back and work out if there is another way in which we can show out values.
If you were managing Portugal, you might be forgiven for being a bit terse about Cristiano Ronaldo blowing up your preparations with the huge row he has stoked with his club, Manchester United, over that interview. Ronaldo has been up before the media, and was pretty defiant about it. Reuters quotes him saying:
.css-14ukgk6{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#0077B6;}In my life, the best timing is always my timing. I dont have to think about what other people think. I speak when I want. The players know me really well for many years and know the type of person I am.
Its an ambitious group that is hungry and focused. So"

England will take the knee before their match against Iran on Monday, although Harry Kane will not wear the OneLove rainbow captains armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights, over concerns this could bring an instant yellow card.
Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said he had no issue with England players taking the knee, a protest that emerged from the Black Lives Matter movement but which is used by footballers as a more general condemnation of prejudice.
Im fine with that, he told Sky News. I think thats a choice for Harry Kane and the team, and indeed for Wales as well. These are their choices, its not for the government to tell them what to do.
And I think when youre playing in a country like Qatar, which does have different standards in the way it treats, for example, the LGBTQ community, its perfectly legitimate for the England or the Welsh team to make that stand.
During the Euro 2020 football competition, which took place last year, Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, refused to condemn fans who booed England players for taking the knee.
Priti Patel, Johnsons home secretary at the time, said England fans had the right to boo players for what she called gesture politics, while Lee Anderson, the Tory MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said he would not watch any England games while the team was supporting a political movement and risked alienating traditional supporters.
Discussions over equality at the World Cup are all the more pointed given laws in Qatar that discriminate against LGBT people.
Fifa, footballs world governing body, has requested that team captains wear armbands with messages such as Football unites the world, Share the meal and Bring the moves.
England and Wales, and some other teams, had planned to defy Fifa and send out their captains wearing the rainbow armband. However, England and Wales and some other World Cup nations have said they now will not.

The decision came after they were warned by Fifa they would face sporting sanctions, and that their captains could be booked or even forced to leave the pitch.
Instead the captains are expected to wear Fifa-approved armbands promoting different social messages throughout the tournament. Fifa announced on Monday that the No Discrimination message, originally scheduled to be worn by teams in the quarter-finals, would instead be worn in the first group games instead.
It was a World Cup like no other. For the last 12 years the Guardian has been reporting on the issues surrounding Qatar 2022, from corruption and human rights abuses to the treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws. The best of our journalism is gathered on our dedicated Qatar: Beyond the Football home page for those who want to go deeper into the issues beyond the pitch.
Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
In a statement the seven federations  also including Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland  expressed dismay at Fifas behaviour.
Fifa has been very clear that it will impose sporting sanctions if our captains wear the armbands on the field of play, they said. As national federations, we cant put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings, so we have asked the captains not to attempt to wear the armbands in Fifa World Cup games.
We were prepared to pay fines that would normally apply to breaches of kit regulations and had a strong commitment to wearing the armband. However, we cannot put our players in the situation where they might be booked or even forced to leave the field of play.
What also frustrated the federations was that they had contacted Fifa in September to say they planned to wear the rainbow armband in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal, yet had heard nothing  until Sunday evening.
We are very frustrated by the Fifa decision which we believe is unprecedented  we wrote to Fifa in September informing them of our wish to wear the One Love armband to actively support inclusion in football, and had no response, they said. Our players and coaches are disappointed  they are strong supporters of inclusion and will show support in other ways.
The federations met Fifa on Monday morning to seek clarity over the issue. Before the statement was issued the Denmark manager, Kasper Hjulmand, made clear his bafflement at Fifas attitude given the armband was worn, with scant fanfare, during Nations League games in September. That competition falls under Uefas jurisdiction.
This is not something invented for this occasion, its something weve done before, he said. A OneLove armband  I cant see the problem to be honest.
The Netherlands manager, Louis van Gaal, said: We are not going to wear the armband if were going to get a yellow card and we need to question whether this is a correct act on the part of Fifa. And you can answer that question. I think it is crystal clear.
The Guardian has spoken to Qatari and Fifa sources who insisted the decision was taken purely by footballs governing body  and that there had been no pressure from Qatar regarding the armband. A Fifa source also pointed out that the regulations have long been clear that unapproved armbands are not allowed  and therefore nothing had really changed.
Fifa said in a statement: Fifa can confirm its No Discrimination campaign has been brought forward from the planned quarter-finals stage in order that all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear this armband during the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022.
This is in line with Article 13.8.1 of the Fifa equipment regulations, which state: For Fifa final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captains armband provided by Fifa.
The Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 regulations, as approved by everyone in the game, exist to preserve the integrity of the field of play for all participants and are equally applicable to all competing teams.

Fifa is an inclusive organisation that wants to put football to the benefit of society by supporting good and legitimate causes, but it has to be done within the framework of the competition regulations which are known to everyone.
The decision was quickly greeted with dismay by fans and LGBTQ+ groups. The Football Supporters Association said: LGBT+ football supporters and their allies will feel angry. Today we feel betrayed. Today we feel contempt for an organisation that has shown its true values by giving the yellow card to players and the red card to tolerance.
Never again should a World Cup be handed out solely on the basis of money and infrastructure. No country which falls short on LGBT+ rights, womens rights, workers rights or any other universal human right should be given the honour of hosting a World Cup.
A joint statement from 3 Lions Pride and The Rainbow Wall, LGBTQ+ fan groups of England and Wales respectively, accused Fifa of censorship and said footballs governing body was crushing the basic human rights to freedom of speech and expression and giving a platform to hate.
The veteran gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said that Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, had showed his true colours after speaking about inclusivity at the weekend.
I urge the team captains at their post-match press conferences to spend just 30 seconds to speak out for the rights of women, LGBTs and migrant workers, he said. That would have a huge impact, reaching a global audience of hundreds of millions of people.
Fifa has crushed the OneLove campaign with the threat of yellow cards. Its time to show Fifa and Qatar the red card.
Infantino said he had spoken to Qatars highest leadership and I can confirm that everyone is welcome.
The British Olympian and BBC presenter Jeannette Kwakye expressed disappointment at the FAs decision. The most powerful protests in global sport have not required permission, she pointed out on social media.
The official spokesman of Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, said: We share the FAs frustration with Fifas decision on this which puts players in a very difficult position. It is, ultimately, a decision for the FA. On LGBT rights more broadly, clearly Qatars policies are not those of the UK government and not ones we would endorse."

In the latest farcical development to grip the World Cup a potential row is brewing after it was suggested that referees could be left with no option but to caution captains who wear the OneLove armband in Qatar. Fifa has asked that all captains wear a different armband on each match day, promoting social messages such as Football unites the world, Share the meal and Bring the moves. It could even send an official into dressing rooms before matches to remove any OneLove armbands.
England and Wales had planned to defy Fifas request by wearing the rainbow armband. The Football Association wrote to the games governing body about its plans in September but received no response. The FA had indicated it would be prepared to receive a fine and has been seeking clarification over whether Kane could start the game on a booking if the England captain dons the armband against Iran, but without a response from the governing body.
The suggestion has been made to the FA that because there is no precedent Fifa could have a free hand in selecting the punishment for a breach of equipment regulations. The FA is hoping for a final decision from Fifa on Monday morning to give the players as much time as possible to concentrate on preparing for the match. Fifa has been approached for comment.
Kane stressed his desire to wear the armband before England face Iran in their opening game in Group B. Weve made it clear as a team and a staff and organisation that we want to wear the armband, the striker said. I know the FA are talking to Fifa at the moment and Im sure by game time tomorrow they will have their decision. I think weve made it clear that we want to wear it.

Gareth Southgate echoed those comments. I know there are conversations going on, the England head coach said. I think a number of European countries have spoken. Weve made our position clear. Hopefully everything will be resolved before the game.
Wales are continuing to plan for Gareth Bale to wear the rainbow armband against USA on Monday and the president of the German football federation (DFB), Bernd Neuendorf, has said Germany are prepared to be fined if Manuel Neuer wears it against Japan on Wednesday. But the DFB is concerned that Neuer could be booked. Two cautions in different matches lead to a suspension from the next game, although single yellow cards are wiped after the quarter-finals.
Virgil van Dijk is worried about the consequences of wearing the armband when the Netherlands face Senegal on Monday. I will wear the one love armband, the Netherlands captain said. Nothing changed from our point of view. If I will get a yellow card for wearing it, then we would have to discuss it because I dont like to play while being on a yellow.

Van Dijk is expected to wear two armbands, also taking the field with the official Fifa one. Englands players will demonstrate their opposition to discrimination by taking the knee before kick-off. The squad discussed the issue before training on Sunday.
We feel we should, Southgate said. We think its a strong statement that will go around the world, especially for young people, that inclusivity is important."

The decision was announced months after a number of countries approached Fifa asking to wear rainbow armbands in Qatar as a gesture against discrimination and in support of LGBTQ+ rights.They received no response to their request, with England and Wales both surprised by Fifas last-minute initiative on Saturday. But both FAs have reaffirmed their intention to wear the rainbow armbands, with the likely prospect that they will be fined for doing so.

Rule 4.3 of Fifas equipment regulations states: No item (of playing kit or other clothing or equipment or otherwise) may be worn or used in any controlled area if Fifa considers that it is dangerous, offensive or indecent, includes political, religious, or personal slogans, statements, or images, or otherwise does not comply in full with the laws of the game.
Fifa said of its campaign: Messaging opportunities will be provided to the participating teams via the team captains armbands during matches, with supporting content being displayed on LED screens around the pitch, on giant screens and on flags in the stadiums, together with additional amplification on Fifas digital platforms and through media, stakeholders, and other public activities.During Saturdays press conference in Doha, Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, was asked why the governing body had not publicly supported the rainbow armbands, and launched its own campaign instead.We have clear regulations on armbands, Infantino replied. We have and engage in campaigns on different topics, campaigns which are universal. We need to find topics that everyone can adhere to. This is an important element for us.
Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar and while organisers and Fifa have repeated the message that everyone is welcome in the country during the World Cup, there has been no clarity over whether laws that would criminalise acts such as holding hands in public have been suspended.

Lou Englefield of the LGBTIQ Human Rights Sports Coalition said Infantino was wrong to suggest LGBTQ+ rights were not a universal topic. We believe that the safety and security of LGBTIQ people at this World Cup has been a huge issue, to have rainbow armbands would be a strong, widely recognised and progressive message of inclusion, she said. Infantino is wrong. Its a global issue, right for every organisation.
Fifa announced on Saturday it was partnering with three United Nations agencies  the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization  to run social campaigns throughout the tournament.
The campaigns are as follows:
Group stage, round one: #FootballUnitesTheWorld

France, the defending champions, were among eight of the 13 European teams going to Qatar who in September joined the OneLove campaign, which started in the Netherlands.
Fifa rules prohibit teams from bringing their own armband designs to the World Cup and insist they must use equipment provided by the governing body.
Asked on Monday about the initiative during a news conference at Frances training ground, Lloris was sceptical.
Before we start anything, we need the agreement of Fifa, the agreement of the [French] federation, Lloris said. Of course, I have my personal opinion on the topic. And its quite close to the [French federation] presidents.
The French federation president, Noël Le Graët, previously said he would prefer Lloris did not wear it because he does not want his country to lecture others.
When we are in France, when we welcome foreigners, we often want them to follow our rules, to respect our culture, and I will do the same when I go to Qatar, quite simply, Lloris said. I can agree or disagree with their ideas, but I have to show respect.

Armbands are the latest battleground for players to push political messages linked to the World Cup hosted in Qatar, where homosexual acts are illegal and the treatment of migrant workers building projects for the tournament has been a decade-long controversy.

Lloris added that France players would likely join forces for a collective action in relation to the respect of human rights in Qatar.We cant remain insensitive to these issues, the Tottenham goalkeeper said. It will be done in a few days, or hours, we will see.
Marcus Thuram was handed the last spot in Frances squad and the uncapped Axel Disasi was also called up on Monday after Presnel Kimpembe had to pull out with an injury. Thuram, a forward with Borussia Mönchengladbach, was added to Didier Deschampss list after the coach summoned only 25 players when he announced his squad last week, leaving one berth open. Disasi, 24, has not missed a minute of Monacos 15 league games this season."

Mead, who is in a relationship with her Arsenal teammate Vivianne Miedema, told BBC Radio 4 the ban on homosexuality in Qatar was the complete opposite to what I believe and respect.
Its not something I will be backing or promoting, Mead said. Its disappointing in the sense that theres no respect on a lot of levels, even though its a game of football.
Englands captain, Harry Kane, and captains of seven other European nations who have qualified for the World Cup have said they will wear an anti-discrimination armband during the tournament in Qatar, which starts on 20 November.
Although Im cheering for the boys who are going to play football there, from the minute it was announced I thought it wasnt the best idea, Mead said. Were in the 21st century and you fall in love with who you fall in love with. It doesnt matter who they are.
Mead said she never felt she had to hide her relationship with Miedema. In the mens game they feel they have to make a statement of the situation. Its been a culture, and that culture needs to shift. Is it a generation thing? Is it a culture thing in the game? I would love to help try and bridge that gap to just try and make it the norm.
The 27-year-old won the Golden Boot and was named player of the tournament at this years European Championship for her instrumental role in helping England win their first major title."

It is time to consider in detail the Inadequate Symbol Of Tolerance adopted this week by the English and Welsh FAs; a symbol of tolerance that will be worn during the World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is punishable by torture and death. And yes, that really does sound like one sweet, sweet symbol of tolerance.
But could we have gone further? Should the FAs have insisted on a slightly more urgent Inadequate Symbol Of Tolerance? Should it have a bolder font, for example? Perhaps the Generic Statement Of Concern, released alongside the Inadequate Symbol Of Tolerance, could have a more disapproving tone.
Bottom line: is the Symbol Of Tolerance getting cut-through? What are the eyeballs on this thing? Could the Inadequate Symbol Of Tolerance, hear me out, actually be genius? Is something brilliant happening here?
On balance, perhaps not. Yes, the symbol looks like the cover artwork for a mid-90s rave-pop track with vocals by someone who used to be in Grange Hill. And yes, standing against all forms of discrimination may be a bit All-Lives-Matter, a statement so deliberately vague it is hard either to agree or to disagree.
And, yes, the players wearing this band of love will still be doing so in a stadium haunted by the ghosts of indentured workers. There is even a case this entire campaign is no more than a swatch of empty branding, a piece of messaging so meaningless it reeks of its own brand of airless corporate death.
But apart from all that, the One Love symbol is at least a gesture, and gestures have value. It was heartening to see it on the arm of Harry Kane, who has been understatedly insistent in his support for tolerance and inclusion in football. Seeing Kane like this will give support and encouragement to someone in the world. This is a thing.
The England squad will also be inviting migrant workers to their training base, which may or may not help the migrant workers. More practically the FA has offered support for the idea of compensation for families of those killed on World Cup construction projects. But then, this might also be difficult as Qatar maintains pretty much nobody has been been killed on World Cup construction projects. Whats zero times a billion dollars? OK, its a deal!
Gareth Southgate was correct when he said England would be criticised whatever they did on these issues, a fact dictated by his second point, that there is a limit to what we can affect. This is a startling statement, if only because it feels like the closest anyone has actually got on this topic to telling the truth.
But not exclusively. Here is another story from Qatar this week. Dr Hend Al Muftah is a prominent Qatari public servant, currently ambassador extraordinary to Qatars mission to the UN in Geneva. She gives lectures on human rights. In 2016 she was named the most influential social media person in Qatar.
A year later she was appointed to Qatars Consultative Council by the emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the same emir who assured world leaders this week that the World Cup would offer open arms (note: not actual open arms) to fans from all walks of life, which is apparently code for the gays.
Dr Hend has backed the Scoring4TheGoals campaign that breaks down barriers & enhances cultural understanding. Her LinkedIn page says she is very interested in working with youth and diverse cultures. She sounds great, progressive and the ideal candidate, as lobbied by Qatar, to become chair of the UN Forum on Human Rights. Which, in a happy case of optics, takes place as the World Cup starts.
Except judging by the content of her social media accounts, Dr Hend also appears to think gay rights are disgusting rights (May God curse them!) and that Jews have dominated, tyrannized and ruled the world, and are our enemies who should be paralyzed.

Although this does explain why she posted a viral message that apparently promises to trample the last corpse of a cursed Zionist, and linked to the observation that Jews, gays and western society are responsible for obscenity, decadence, cocaine, crack, nudity, sex and violence. Which does, to be fair, sound like a decent night out.
Sadly for Dr Hends candidacy the monitoring organisation UN Watch brought this content to light, describing her as Qatars ambassador of hate, which doesnt sound the right ambassador for a human rights forum during the One Love World Cup.
Why am I telling this story? Because for all its grim details, and notwithstanding the fact Dr Hend may have changed her views, it tells us something genuine about tolerance and opposed cultural values. Basically, and even speaking as an evil-doer, its refreshing to hear someone say what they actually think.
It is clear enough what is happening with the Symbol Of Tolerance. A fine line is being trodden between placating the home audience, who care about this version of tolerance and human rights, and not offending your hosts, who dont.
Qatar predicted the future 12 years ago and has essentially won this long game. Qatar has 200 years of gas reserves in an energy crisis. Qatar is not looking for advice on how to behave. Qatar has a drone army. Qatar has the World Cup and the Glastonbury spider. Qatar will welcome you in and put on a show. But with the best will in the world, Qatar thinks youre probably going to hell anyway. Cool symbol though, bro.
Unwilling to boycott, unable to turn away, it is hard to blame the FAs statement drafters and logo designers, who find themselves trying to corporate-message their way out of a place where nothing can ever be right because basically everything sounds wrong.
The chief villains are of course Fifa, not just for awarding the World Cup to Qatar, but for even entertaining a bid, for taking the money, while pretending to espouse the noble ideals of tolerance, inclusion and all the rest. In the face of this what do we have? Love hearts, curtly phrased statements. And a sense, above all, of the limits of things."

The escalating row over quarantine restrictions, and the lack of exemptions for players returning from red?zone countries, led to Premier League clubs reluctantly but unanimously deciding to take action at a meeting on Tuesday. The Premier League, which has backed the clubs stance, has also registered its concern at Fifas decision to allow Conmebol teams to play three fixtures in the next two international breaks.
On Monday the Egypt FA revealed it had received a letter from Liverpool explaining why Mohamed Salah would not be released for the World Cup qualifier against Angola in Cairo next week. Liverpool have also informed the Brazilian FA that Alisson, Fabinho and Roberto Firmino would not be released for their World Cup qualifiers against Chile, Argentina and Peru as they, and Salah, would need to quarantine for 10 days on their return. Manchester City had adopted the same stance with Ederson and Gabriel Jesus.
Nearly 60 players from 19 Premier League clubs were due to travel to 26 red-zone countries in the September international window.
In a statement the Premier League confirmed the decision follows Fifas current position not to extend its temporary release exception for players required to quarantine on their return from international duty, adding: Extensive discussions have taken place with both the FA and the government to find a solution, but due to ongoing public health concerns relating to incoming travellers from red-list countries, no exemption has been granted.
If required to quarantine on return from red list countries, not only would players welfare and fitness be significantly impacted but they would also be unavailable to prepare for and play in two Premier League match rounds, a Uefa club competition match-day and the third round of the EFL Cup. This period takes into consideration 10 days of hotel quarantine on return to England but does not include any additional time that would be required for players to regain match fitness.
The Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, said: Premier League clubs have always supported their players desires to represent their countries  this is a matter of pride for all concerned. However, clubs have reluctantly but rightly come to the conclusion that it would be entirely unreasonable to release players under these new circumstances. We understand the challenges that exist in the international match calendar and remain open to workable solutions.
Clubs also discussed their dissatisfaction with Fifas decision to extend Conmebols international window in September and October from nine to 11 days. This places additional international obligations on players from that region, to the detriment of their availability to represent their clubs, the Premier League statement read. Fifa was urged to work with all stakeholders to ensure an agreeable conclusion can be reached on the issue."
