Despite Budweisers reported $75m (£63m) deal with Fifa, a decision that alcoholic beer could not be sold in World Cup stadiums was taken two days before the tournament started. That led the brand to tweet  then delete  the message: Well, this is awkward 
Budweiser announced the beer would go to the winning side with a tweet saying: New Day, New Tweet. Winning Country gets the Buds. Who will get them? and a picture of a large quantity of beer in a storage warehouse.

The move sparked considerable mockery on social media, with some users suggesting the move acts as a disincentive to winning the World Cup because the American brand of beer has a low reputation in some European countries, despite its being owned by AB InBev, which is based in Leuven in Belgium. Props to Budweiser on giving everyone the perfect excuse to not win the tournament, quipped one person on Twitter.

The companys non-alcoholic brand, Bud Zero, is still available in the stadiums. Budweiser has been a World Cup sponsor since the 1986 tournament in Mexico. In the wake of the announcement of the beer ban, Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, said the governing body had failed to persuade the Qatar government to stand by the original decision to allow sales, but that if anything the situation has brought us even closer together with Budweiser.
Now it looks as if the team that prevail in Qatars alcohol-free Lusail Stadium in the final on 18 December will be taking home not just the trophy and the $42m (£35m) prize money, but a slab of beer for their country as well.

It gives footballs governing body another headache hours after it was forced to ban alcohol from stadiums by the Qatari authorities, a decision that complicated its $75m (£63m) contract with the brewer of Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch InBev.
One representative of another major sponsor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that many partners had felt let down by Fifa in lots of ways. They also indicated there had been informal discussions about potential contractual breaches and reneging on deliverables.
Everyone has a gripe in some way or form, they added. There is a lot of regrouping going [on] to understand what the options are contractually speaking.

Earlier Fifa confirmed in a terse statement that alcohol would not be sold inside or around the perimeter of World Cup stadiums.
Following discussions between host country authorities and Fifa, a decision has been made to focus the sale of alcoholic beverages on the Fifa Fan Festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues, removing sales points of beer from Qatars World Cup 2022 stadium perimeters, it said.
There is no impact to the sale of Bud Zero, which will remain available at all Qatars World Cup stadiums.
However it will now be looking nervously over its shoulders at the prospect of legal action from Budweiser, unless some sort of compensation can be agreed with Qatar.
Shortly before the announcement the US beer brand sent a tweet  since deleted  that said: Well, this is awkward
The sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, a conservative Muslim nation, but organisers had promised it would be available in match venues and fan zones  and would be reasonably priced.
However it has now decided that alcohol will be available at matches only in hospitality boxes, where the cheapest suites are nearly £20,000 a match, and in some fan zones after 7pm, where it will cost nearly £12 for 500ml of Budweiser.
According to the New York Times, staff members were told the move had followed security advice but that the change had originated with Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani  the brother of Qatars ruling emir and the royal most active in the day-to-day planning of the tournament.
The Guardian also understands another consideration was wanting to make sure the large number of supporters from Gulf and Asian countries, where drinking alcohol is not part of the culture, felt comfortable.
Until recently organisers had always said that they would find a way to find a middle ground between western fans tastes and Qatars conservative culture. That message was reiterated most recently by Fatma al-Nuaimi, head of communications for the Supreme Committee, who said: When it comes to alcohol, hospitality is part of our culture, even if alcohol is not. So it will be in the places where the fans will gather, but not openly on the streets.
The organisations official fan guide also states that ticket holders will have access to Budweiser, Budweiser Zero, and Coca-Cola products within the stadium perimeter for at least three hours before games, and for one hour afterwards.
The news was greeted with frustration by the Football Supporters Association, which questioned whether the Qataris could now be trusted on their other promises.
Some fans like a beer at a match and some dont, but the real issue is the last minute U-turn which speaks to a wider problem  the total lack of communication and clarity from the organising committee towards supporters, a spokesperson said.
If they can change their minds on this at a moments notice, with no explanation, supporters will have understandable concerns about whether they will fulfil other promises relating to accommodation, transport or cultural issues."

His response was succinct. Its a deliberate fuck you to the west.
Of course it was. Yes, the Qataris wanted to ensure that fans of every nation, religion and creed feel comfortable at matches  and that wouldnt be the case if some were boozed-up or blotto. And yes, Qatar remains a conservative Muslim country, in which alcohol is alien to the culture. But that was true on 2 December 2010, the day it won the right to host the World Cup, every bit as much as today.
So for it to rip up its promises and policy so late in the day should be seen for what it is: a show of strength and an almighty two fingers up to its critics.

Guardian reporting goes far beyond what happens on the pitch. Support our investigative journalism today.
But, as another well-connected football consultant put it, Fridays decision is part of a notable change in tack from the Qataris.
For years, they have appeared contrite and humble amid questions about their record, he said. But now with the World Cup so imminent, their attitude has changed. The geopolitics around energy, and the wests increased need for gas during the war in Ukraine, makes them think they are immune. And if someone attacks them, they hit right back.
Take LGBTQ+ rights. For years, western reporters and human rights groups have criticised Qatars record. For years, itthe host country has stuck to giving vague assurances that everyone would be welcome. Then this month a Qatari World Cup ambassador, Khalid Salman, called homosexuality a damage in the mind and warned gay fans they would have to accept our rules. That is some adjustment.
Meanwhile when the Sunday Times suggested that Qatar had been using private investigators to target journalists, it didnt let it pass. Instead it threatened legal action to ensure those responsible are held to account.
Qatar also believes it has made significant progress on workers rights and that this has been largely ignored by a western media who continue to focus on the negatives. That has furthered fuelled its anger and frustration.
Yet, in recent days, Qatar has also sent a more inflammatory message: that many criticisms of its human rights record are based on western racism, or a misplaced sense of western superiority.
That message is largely erroneous. And it is misplaced. But it is gathering force by the day.
As Qatars labour minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, put it this week: They dont want to allow a small country, an Arab country, an Islamic country, to organise the World Cup.
He added: Some politicians and some media outlets in western countries have lost the moral and professional motive in their attack against Qatar.
That message has been echoed by local media. When a handful of people in the western press questioned whether India-born supporters of England, Brazil and Argentina might be fake fans, the Doha News quickly played the racism card.

Meanwhile the state-run Qatar News Agency enthusiastically endorsed the official position, noting that: His Excellency pointed out that the false slander campaign transgressed all limits in its attempt to discredit Qatar, the latest of which was the claim that the World Cup organisers used fake fans who receive money to attend the matches.
What makes Qatars behaviour more remarkable is that usually in the buildup to a World Cup, the Fifa show takes over. Rules are introduced to ensure things are done a certain way, and that brands such as Budweiser who are paying $75m (£63m) are heavily promoted. Not here. Not now.
Instead the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, will spend Saturday morning answering searching questions about whether his organisation will face a massive lawsuit, which ensures the story will run for another 24 hours.
But this story isnt about whether beer should be sold at stadiums. In truth, if the Qataris had decided to ban it years ago, the issue would have long blown over. It is about shifting goalposts and worrying uncertainties.
For years it has talked about finding a middle ground between Qatars conservative culture while doing its best to accommodate the 1.2 million expected visitors; an entirely reasonable position. But after this, how do we know that other assurances will not also be discarded over the next month? After all, if the Qataris are prepared to disregard the wishes of Fifa and its major sponsors, who could be next?Can LGBTQ+ fans really trust that they wont be censured for holding hands? Will England fans get in trouble for a minor cultural misunderstanding, despite Qatari claims they will take a patient and relaxed approach?
At least one thing has become clear. This World Cup will not only be played on Qatars turf, but by its rules too."

However footballs governing body will now be looking nervously over its shoulders at the prospect of legal action from Budweiser, which has a $75m (£63m) sponsorship agreement with Fifa, and is likely to regard this as a major breach of contract.

The Guardian understands the decision was taken after the Qataris, as the host nation, decided that everyone inside World Cup stadiums had to feel comfortable  and that this would not be the case if fans were seen drinking alcohol or turned up drunk.
In their view, this is a tournament where there will be a large number of supporters from Gulf and Asian countries, where drinking alcohol is not part of the culture. And whereas there are some alcohol-free fan zones in Doha, in a stadium it is hard to escape people who have been drinking.
However it is unclear why they have taken the decision now and not in the 12 years since winning the right to host the tournament. Until recently organisers had always said that they would find a way to find a middle ground between western fans tastes and Qatars conservative culture.

The sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, but it is due to be available in the area immediately outside match venues and fan zones, as well as within hotels.
Budweiser is one of Fifas biggest sponsors but was told on Saturday to relocate stalls selling its product at stadiums to less prominent locations.
The Times reports that Qatar 2022 now wants to go even further and that discussions are ongoing between Fifa and Budweiser. A decision is expected on Friday but it is believed beer could be banned from all stadiums.
Budweiser remains one of Fifas key partners and if it is denied the opportunity to sell beer or to have any visibility at the World Cup matches, then footballs governing body would be in breach of a multi-million dollar contract.
Fifa and the Budweiser owner AB InBev have been approached for comment.
In response to the request to move its outlets, AB InBev told Sky News: AB InBev was informed on 12 November and are working with Fifa to relocate the concession outlets to locations as directed. We are working with Fifa to bring the best possible experience to the fans. Our focus is on delivering the best possible consumer experience under the new circumstances.
If the beer ban goes ahead, the only place supporters will be able to drink alcohol will be at a designated fan park, where Budweiser has already revealed a 500ml drink will cost fans the pretty price of £11.60.
A few hotel bars will typically charge around £12-£15 for a beer or glass of wine."

Alcohol is usually restricted in Qatar, a conservative Muslim country, with the few hotel bars allowed typically charging about £12-£15 for a beer or glass of wine.
It had been indicated by Nasser al-Khater, the chief executive officer of the 2022 World Cup, that prices for beer in the fan zones and at stadiums would be much lower for fans, with others indicating it would be about £7-£8 per pint.

However it has emerged that a 500ml glass of Budweiser, the only official beer of the World Cup, will cost 50 riyals  about £11.60. A non-alcoholic version will be 30 riyals (£7) and water will cost 10 riyals (£2.30).
Budweiser has stated that fans, who must prove they are older than 21 to buy alcohol, will be limited to a maximum purchase of four Budweiser units per person. Supporters are also being told: Drink wiser, cheer better, hydrate between Buds.
In a sign that there may have been discussions with Fifa and the Qatari government before the final pricing policy was reached, the company added in its statement: Budweiser is proud to be served in compliance with the local rules and regulations by Fifas appointed concessionaire.

About 1,000 drivers and dray workers  a person who delivers beer for a brewery  at GXO Logistics plan to stage a first round of strikes between 31 October and 4 November at depots across the UK.
The Unite union said the strike would impede the ability of pubs and other venues to replenish their cellars prior to the World Cup. Further action was planned for closer to kick-off on 20 November if the dispute was not resolved, it said.
The strikes would affect pubs and venues supplied by brewers including Heineken, Stonegate, Admiral Taverns and Shepherd Neame.
GXO Logistics delivers to about 4,500 pubs in London and south-east England and has a network of 22 depots from Inverness to Southampton where rolling strike action will take place. A ban on overtime working will come into force from 24 October.
The company said it had plans in place to ensure pubs and venues did not run dry if strikes interrupted its regular schedule of deliveries.
We are in constant contact with our customers and should a strike go ahead, we have business continuity plans in place to ensure they are adequately stocked and minimise impact on consumers, a spokesperson for GXO said.
The US-based firm reported $777m (£690m) in revenues from its UK operations in the three months to the end of June, its biggest single source of its $2.2bn global revenues for the quarter. Total adjusted profits reached $176m in the second quarter.
UK workers rejected a 5% pay offer, in a deal that included a reduction in sick pay. GXO can easily afford to pay and Unite is determined to see that they do, the unions general secretary, Sharon Graham, said.
The dispute with management also involves plans to close the GXO depot in Dagenham, Essex, which will result in job cuts and an increase in the workload for drivers at its Croydon, Faversham and Greenford sites.

GXO said the unions version of the pay deal was inaccurate and misleading and that the strike action was putting its members, the hospitality sector and consumers at risk of unnecessary disruption.
The company said the proposal on the table represented an average 9.2% pay increase and there was no impact on sick pay.
The offer is highly competitive and follows an above-inflation annual pay raise of 4% last year, the spokesperson said. The increase exceeds the industry average and, in every region, earnings for our drivers are above both the regional and national averages."

Prices are yet to be revealed but a Qatar 2022 spokesperson told the Guardian that tickets would be affordable for all the family and in line with recent World Cups. For those with money to burn, executive packages are already available. These start at $950 (£707) per person for a match club package, which includes a group stage ticket, street food dining, a gift and drinks including beer and wine  while the more extravagant Pearl Lounge experience, with fine dining, mixologists, Champagne selection, sommeliers, and premium spirits starts at $4,950 a head.
A decision is yet to be made, although the expectation is that it is more likely than not. In Qatar the sale of alcohol is restricted to a few luxury hotels and is expensive at £10-£15 for beer or wine. However for the World Cup it will be easier to purchase and more affordable. During the 2019 Club World Cup, for instance, the Qataris experimented with a wet fan zone, with beer, wine and cider on sale for about £5  a similar plan is likely to be in place for the 2022 World Cup.
Under Qatari law it is an offence to be drunk in public. The hope from organisers is that fans will understand that they are in a conservative country and moderate their behaviour. The sight of England fans conducting an impromptu beer snake along Dohas Corniche is unlikely to go down well. This is ultimately a conservative but hospitable country, says one insider. So there has to be an understanding on both sides that people should come and have a good time, while also respecting the culture.
With eight stadiums within a 50-mile radius and most fans staying in Doha, there is clearly the potential for trouble. However organisers insist they are rigorously prepared for all eventualities, having attended numerous major tournaments since 2011 to learn how supporters behave at major events. They have also had a partnership with Interpol called Project Stadia since 2012, which they believe will equip them to handle any trouble. Everything has been done to make sure that its a safe experience for fans, insists one insider.
Organisers expect more than a million visitors during the 28-day event, but with only 30,000 hotel rooms in the country they are having to rely on other forms of accommodation. Under a deal with Accor the French company will provide staff to manage and operate more than 60,000 rooms in apartments and villas across Qatar. The idea is that fans will get what organisers call quality accommodation at a fair price  while Qatar will not be lumbered with thousands of hotel rooms they dont need after the World Cup.
Yes. Organisers have hired two huge ships, with swimming pools and spas, which offer a combined capacity of 4,000 cabins. The expectation is that alcohol also will be available  although the supreme committee, responsible for delivery of the tournament, has nervously played down talk of party ships and booze cruises. Plans to allow fans to stay in luxury tents in the desert are also being worked on.
Yes. Qatar has said it will comply with Fifa rules promoting tolerance and inclusion at matches, despite its strict anti-LGBTQ+ laws. As Fifas chief social responsibility and education officer, Joyce Cook, puts it: Im an openly gay woman in football, so this is personally something Im close to. We will see a progressive change in all of those aspects, and rainbow flags, T-shirts will all be welcome in the stadium  thats a given. They understand very well that is our stance.
Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with a 2004 law stipulating imprisonment between one and three years for sodomy between men. However the Qataris have repeatedly insisted that everyone will be welcome, regardless of nationality, gender and sexual orientation. They also stress that the country has a more conservative culture and fans will be asked to respect local norms  which frowns on public displays of affection.
Yes, according to Paul Amann, the founder of Liverpool fans group Kop Outs. Amann, who visited Qatar with his partner during the 2019 Club World Cup, said he was initially worried about going after being invited by organisers. However, what he found surprised him. Its got a very horrific law on the statute, dont get me wrong, he says. But my husband and I walked around Dohas Corniche, and went to the museum and visited the souk at night, we felt entirely safe. But we were respectful of the legal situation over there, which covers both heterosexuals, as well as LGBT+ people. We didnt make public displays of affection. But then we rarely do in the UK."

However, they have also urged England fans to bridge the cultural gap by being on their best behaviour if their team qualifies.
A pint of beer in Doha, where most matches will be played, typically costs around £10 because of sin taxes in the Muslim country. However, organisers expect to announce cheaper alcohol prices, an extension of hotel happy hours and more locations where it will be sold during the World Cup in the coming months.
But they are privately wary of selling alcoholic drinks on the cruise ships where many England fans are expected to stay if Gareth Southgates side qualifies because of fears they could turn into booze cruises.
Alcohol is not part of our culture, Nasser al-Khater, the chief executive officer of the 2022 World Cup, admitted. However, hospitality is. Alcohol is not as readily available here as in other parts of the world but for the World Cup we want to ensure it is accessible for fans who want to have a drink, so we are trying to find designated locations for fans to have alcohol, other than traditional places such as hotels and so forth.
We recognise there is an issue with the price and it is something we are looking into. We are looking at finding ways to reduce the price of alcohol.
Al-Khater also confirmed his security team was working closely with authorities in England, and other countries that have traditionally qualified for the World Cup, to help them best deal with fans  and to ensure police do not react too forcefully to behaviour they might not usually encounter.
There is a lot of training that is going into security personnel to make sure things that are culturally different are seen in that frame  of what might be acceptable to an England fan might not be acceptable here  and to make sure we bridge that gap.
However, al-Khater said England fans would have to abide by the law and conceded he was worried by the anti-social behaviour of some supporters at the Nations League in Portugal.
Look, I think it is a concern, he added. Safety and security at any major event is your number one priority. The possibility with altercations between fans because of the size of the country, and a lot of the fans being in the same vicinity, is the key priority. But what we expect from the fans is similar to what we saw in Russia.
Qatar is expecting to welcome more than one million fans from across the globe and al-Khater insisted supporter safety was of paramount importance and that gay and transgender fans would be made welcome.
I would like to assure any fan of any gender, orientation, religion and race that they can rest assured Qatar is one of the safest countries in the world and they will all be welcome here. The safety and security of every single fan is of the utmost importance to us.
Theres a lot of training, theres a lot of understanding there are different cultures that are going to be descending here and we need to maintain that we are a hospitable culture and hospitable people.
However, he said fans coming for the tournament would also have to be respectful of local laws and customs.
We are also going to expect people to get acquainted with our norms and our culture and our laws, he continued. And whatever happens in the middle is where we need to make sure it is dealt with in the most appropriate way to make sure its a World Cup where everybody feels welcome  and that nobody feels they are in any way intimidated or threatened, whether its over religion or gender, across the board, for everybody.
When pressed about how Qataris may react to a gay couple holding hands, Al-Khater insisted they would not be treated any differently from any other couple or individual. I will put it another way: a public display of affection is frowned upon, he added. Its not part of our culture. But that goes across the board to everybody."

Along with a string of other issues, Qatars laws prohibiting public drinking have been a source of constant questions for organisers since it won the right to host the tournament in December 2010.
I know in South Africa there where specific courts established during the World Cup for this kind of thing, and that is something we were discussing with Fifa, the Qatar 2022 organising committee chief executive Hassan al-Thawadi told Reuters. In relation to drunk fans it will be as it is anywhere else, anyone who is rowdy, anyone who breaches the law, will be very gently  depending on how they react  taken care of in a manner to make sure that people are not disrupting the public order Everyone will be able to have fun and be exposed to Qatari culture.
During the 2010 World Cup, South Africa set up 56 special courts to deal swiftly with cases related to the tournament. But the courts were criticised for their heavy-handed treatment of some local offenders and also for being used to swiftly prosecute those breaking laws introduced specifically at the behest of Fifa, including those related to ambush marketing.
Under Qatari law it is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in a public place, with sales restricted to high end hotels, though the sale of alcohol is likely to be permitted in specially created fanzones during the tournament. The contentious Qatar World Cup has faced questions over everything from how it was won to its timing, with searing summer temperatures of over 50C (122F) necessitating a move to winter, but al-Thawadi said its laws on alcohol would not be an issue.
We welcome everyone in the world. Weve hosted many people, from many places and that was never an issue. This will be a fun World Cup. It will be one of the best cups out there, he added.
Meanwhile, sources close to the Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino have insisted that no pact will be agreed with his rival for the Fifa presidency, Sheikh Salman Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain.
On Monday Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister and Fifa executive committee member, reignited speculation that the pair could combine their efforts before the election on 26 February.
Given the Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman only decided to stand when Michel Platini was forced to pull out, after initially promising to back the Frenchman, speculation that the pair have some kind of implicit deal has continued to swirl.
But Infantino has publicly insisted that he is committed to winning the race and has no deal with Salman, who secured the support of the Confederation of African Football late last week.
When there is a formal support from Asia and Africa, then you are certainly the frontrunner. But I am not sure that all African federations would support him. Moreover, I do know that not all African federations will do that, said Mutko.
But it does not mean that he is an unsuitable candidate. He is a strong and a good candidate, but Europe has its own candidate and he is Gianni Infantino. Russias stance is very simple as we want them to come to terms eventually and lay out all their trump cards on the table.
Infantino has already announced that Russia will back him. Six other European federations  Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Poland, and Slovakia  confirmed their support on Monday.
The outspoken Liberia FA President Musa Bility, who failed an integrity check to stand himself in the election, said that up to half of CAFs 54 members would defy their confederations instruction to vote for Sheikh Salman.
Bility said the Liberian FA, one of 209 voters, would back Prince Ali of Jordan, who is also standing along with French former Fifa executive Jerome Champagne and South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale."

Qatari officials have said that the 500,000 football fans expected to descend on their country during the World Cup will be allowed to consume alcohol in designated zones, but how to best balance the countrys cultural values with Fifas requirements for the tournament remains contentious.
I know in South Africa there were specific courts established during the World Cup for this kind of thing, and that is something we were discussing with Fifa, the head of the Gulf states 2022 committee, Hassan Al Thawadi, said at a sports conference in Doha.
During its 2010 World Cup, South Africa set up 56 special courts to accelerate cases involving foreign fans so they could be dealt with before either suspects or witnesses left the country.
In South Africa, most court proceedings ended with fines for those found guilty. The same might apply in Qatar, though drug offences often carry jail terms.
Although not dry like neighbouring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in the Gulf State alcohol is served only at elite hotels. Public drunkenness is prohibited, as is bringing alcohol to Qatar from abroad.
In relation to drunk fans it will be as it is anywhere else. Anyone who is rowdy, anyone who breaches the law, will be very gently  depending on how they react  taken care of in a manner to make sure that people are not disrupting the public order, said Thawadi. Everyone will be able to have fun and be exposed to Qatari culture.
Consumption of alcohol is likely to be largely ignored by Qatars predominantly young population, as it is swept away with the euphoria of hosting the competition, Thawadi said.
We welcome everyone in the world. Weve hosted many people, from many places and [drinking] was never an issue. This will be a fun World Cup. It will be one of the best cups out there.
Fifa has said it will defend the commercial rights of its sponsors, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, which will sponsor the 2022 tournament. Brazil initially refused to sell alcohol during the matches of the 2014 World Cup, but eventually relented after pressure from Fifa."
