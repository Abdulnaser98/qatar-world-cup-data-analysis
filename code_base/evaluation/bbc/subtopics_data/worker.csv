A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed. .I make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed. .In a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children. .She eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago. .""Madam is crazy,"" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. ""She shouts at me every day."" .Before Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states. .Under scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers. .For example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent. .But Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says. .There is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under Â£350) and is able to send it all home to support her family. .Joanna Concepcion of Migrante International, a grassroots organisation supporting Filipino overseas workers, says that many keep quiet about bad working conditions because earning money for their families is their overriding priority. .But when those in Gulf states do feel confident enough to talk freely, she says, they often mention serious abuse. One woman said her employer would push her head into a toilet basin and deny her food and water when he was angry. .By contrast, a maid employed by the ruling royal Al Thani family, says she is treated well - but she has no day off, as all workers now should under the new rules. .Smiley and animated, Althea (not her real name) video calls the BBC from the basement of a royal residence. She explains that her employers have given her an iPhone, clothes, jewellery and shoes of a kind she couldn't afford back home in the Philippines. .As in Gladys's case, it's the difficulty of earning a living wage at home that has brought her here. .As we speak, other Filipino domestic workers, who share a large room in Althea's living quarters, say Hi and join the call. .They have their own bedrooms and a shared kitchen. This is important. The maids Althea sees on TikTok and Facebook begging for food, and pleading for someone to rescue them, are not as fortunate. .""I see those videos online all the time, which is why I feel so lucky,"" she says. ""For me, every day feels like a fairy tale."" .Nonetheless, it's hard work in these ""Cinderella palaces"" as she refers to them, with their high ceilings and chandeliers, antiques inlaid with gold, mother-of-pearl table tops, and freshly cut flowers. .The day generally begins at 6.30am, when staff prepare breakfast for the family. Althea eats once the family has finished. After clearing away, they clean the rooms and set places for lunch. .""It is light work because there are many of us,"" Althea says. .Maids rest in their flats between 3pm and 6pm, then prepare for dinner. Once dinner is over, Althea has finished work, and is free to leave the compound if she wants. .The royal family doesn't hold on to her passport. But Althea does work every day, including weekends. She doesn't get the day off that Qatari law is now supposed to guarantee. It's a price she pays for providing her family with vital financial support. .Mary Grace Morales, a recruiter in Manila who pairs Filipino staff with VIPs in the Gulf, says working for the palace is an ""enviable"" job. .""The family is generous,"" she says. And, in a comment reflecting the hardships the maids may have faced at home, she adds: ""The girls get fatter while they are in the palace. The family feeds them well."" .But the royals have some very specific requirements, she reveals. .""The girls sent to work for the Qatari royal family are between 24 and 35 and very pretty,"" Ms Morales says. .She pauses to look at the screen where I stare back at her from the BBC headquarters in London. .""Prettier than you,"" she says, smiling. .She later sends a WhatsApp to apologise, as her children overheard and said she had been rude. I assure her I was not offended - and don't mention that hiring people on the basis of their looks would be illegal in many countries. .Joanna Concepcion, of Migrante International, says she hopes Althea's account of working as a royal maid is true, but adds: ""It's unlikely that we can know that for certain while she is still in Qatar and working for such a powerful family."" .Some royal staff have complained after leaving the country. In 2019 three British and American workers - a bodyguard, personal trainer and private tutor - sued the emir's sister, Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and her husband, in New York, alleging that they had been made to work long hours without overtime. The couple denied the allegations and settled without any admission of liability. .""Reporting and addressing cases of violence and harassment, lack of occupational safety and health, and lack of decent accommodation can be challenging,"" says International Labour Organization (ILO) regional director for Arab states, Ruba Jaradat. .The ILO says it is working with Qatar to implement the new rules guaranteeing a minimum wage, a day off each week, sick leave and overtime payments, although this remains ""a challenge"". .Althea, in her royal palace, says she is happy despite the long hours. .When she goes to bed she will message one of her siblings or parents in the Philippines. She often feels homesick - a fairytale palace is not home. .However, it remains a crucial source of income. .""I could never support my family without this job,"" she says. .The BBC asked the Qatari royal family and the Qatari embassy in London to comment, but received no reply. .Illustrations by Marta Klawe Rzeczy .How does Qatar treat foreign workers? .'I am very afraid', says Qatari transgender woman .Families seek answers over Qatar building deaths"

Al Khater said. ""I mean, death is a natural part of life, whether it's at work, whether it's in your sleep. .""Of course, a worker died. Our condolences go to his family. However, I mean it is strange that this is something you want to focus on as your first question."" .He added: ""Look, workers' deaths has been a big subject during the World Cup. Everything that has been said and everything that has been reflected about workers' deaths has been absolutely false. .""This theme, this negativity around the World Cup has been something that we've been faced with. .""We're a bit disappointed that the journalists have been exacerbating this false narrative. And honestly, I think a lot of the journalists have to ask themselves and reflect on why they've been trying to bang on about the subject for so long."" .Ella Knight, Amnesty International migrants' labour rights researcher, said: ""Unfortunately, Mr Al Khater is mistaken when he says that every fatality is investigated. This is simply not true. .""We and others have been calling on the Qatari authorities to conduct such investigations on workers' deaths for years to no avail. .""Instead, they continue to simply write off vast numbers of deaths as being due to 'natural causes' despite the clear health risks associated with working in extreme temperatures. .""It goes without saying that the Government should be investigating this most recent tragic case, as well as the deaths of all others. Every single family who has lost a loved one as a result of their working conditions in Qatar deserves answers and remedy for their loss."" .Human rights organisations and a number of football associations whose countries are involved in the tournament say they will ""continue to press"" Qatar and Fifa to establish a compensation fund for migrant workers and their families, as well as the establishment of a migrant worker centre in Doha."

But it said a failure to fully enforce or implement these changes was undermining progress. .It claimed thousands of workers are still being denied wages and rest days, being exposed to unsafe working conditions, and faced barriers to changing jobs. .It said the deaths of thousands of migrant workers over the past decade on World Cup-related projects and wider infrastructure remain unexplained.external-link .""Although Qatar has made important strides on labour rights over the past five years, it's abundantly clear that there is a great distance still to go,"" Amnesty International's head of economic and social justice, Steve Cockburn, said. .He added that, despite pressure from Amnesty and a working group from European governing body Uefa to establish a migrant workers' centre and compensation scheme, ""Qatar and Fifa are still not budging"". .Amnesty has said a compensation fund should be worth at least Â£350m - equal to the amount due to be awarded in prize money at the event. .In response, Fifa said: ""A wide range of measures have been implemented over the past years to improve protections for workers in Qatar, and these developments have come about largely as a consequence of the World Cup being played in the country. .""Workers have been compensated in various forms where companies failed to uphold the Workers' Welfare Standards of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy. .""Fifa remains in positive ongoing dialogue with all relevant authorities in Qatar over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup.

They aren't political actors, they just want to be paid for their labour,"" Mr Qadri added. .Earlier this year, BBC Arabic reported allegations that Qatar is under-reporting the number of migrant workers who have died of heat stroke. .FIFA, the organisation for international football, was earlier this year urged to set up a compensation fund of at least $440m (Â£350m) for migrant workers who have suffered ""human rights abuses"" .A spokesperson for the government's World Cup organising committee declined to comment on the Al Bandary protest. The Al Bandary group did not respond to a request for comment. .The Qatari government said 96% of eligible workers in Qatar are covered by a wage protection system, which obliges employers to transfer all wages through Qatari banks within seven days of their due date, and that gaps in the system were being identified. .Life at 50C: Qatar accused of under-reporting deaths in Gulf's killer heat .Qatar accused of under-reporting heat deaths.

officer loses Qatar corruption appeal," .A former employee of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organisers who raised concerns over migrant workers has lost his appeal against a conviction for corruption. .A court in Doha sentenced Abdullah Ibhais to three years in prison after it upheld a guilty verdict on the charge of misappropriating state funds. .Ibhais said security forces coerced him into signing a confession and that he was being punished for criticising the handling of a migrant workers' strike. .Qatari officials denied the claims. .They insisted the trial was fair and that Ibhais was convicted on the basis of ""an abundance of strong and credible evidence"". .Human rights group FairSquare said the failure of football's world governing body, Fifa, to call on Qatar to ensure a fair trial had ""enabled"" the verdict, for which, it asserted, there was no evidence other than Ibhais's confession. .Ibhais, a Jordanian national, was a media manager for Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, which is overseeing preparations for the World Cup. .The Supreme Committee said that it received a complaint alleging corrupt activity in October 2019 from a third party participant in a tender for a contract related to the management of its social media platforms. .Following an internal investigation, Ibhais and another employee were suspended on full pay and the findings were passed on to Qatari authorities, it added. .FairSquare and Human Rights Watch reported that Ibhais was initially arrested that November on the basis of allegations that he was engaged in activities aimed at ""harming the state or its security"". .He told the two campaign groups that interrogators coerced him into confessing to lesser charges, and that he was denied access to a lawyer during questioning. .Ibhais alleged that it was his internal criticism of the Supreme Committee's handling of a strike by migrant workers over unpaid wages in August 2019 that led to his prosecution. .He retracted the confession during his trial, but the court refused to invalidate it and found him guilty this April of ""bribery"", ""violation of the integrity of tenders and profits"", and ""intentional damage to public funds"". He was sentenced to five years in prison. .Ibhais was taken into custody by police on 15 November, reportedly just before he was due to be interviewed by two journalists from Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. The journalists were later detained themselves by Qatari security forces for more than 30 hours for allegedly trespassing on private property and filming without a permit. .Ibhais went on hunger strike in prison while awaiting his appeal. .""For me this was the last resort after I was denied a chance for a fair trial.

Systemic reform is a long-term process and shifting the behaviour of every company takes time. Through its actions, the government is sending a strong message to companies that violations will not be tolerated. .""Qatar has never shied away from acknowledging that its labour system is still a work in progress."" .Speaking after Monday's win, England boss Southgate said: ""We will take the time to educate ourselves and if we feel there are areas we can highlight and help, we have always tried to do that and we will do that."" .Norway, Netherlands and Germany players have all protested about alleged human rights abuses in Qatar. .""The exploitation of Qatar's massive migrant workforce has already cast a dark shadow over next year's World Cup,"" said Amnesty International UK's chief executive Sacha Deshmukh. .""The Football Association ought to use the remaining year until kick-off to push for lasting labour reforms in Qatar. It is part of the Uefa Working Group on Workers' Rights in Qatar and can press the Doha authorities over strengthening migrant worker protections, investigating worker deaths and helping to fashion a tournament with a genuinely positive legacy. .""It's more important than ever that England's coaching staff, players and supporters raise human rights issues ahead of next year's kick-off."" .The treatment of migrant workers has been highlighted since Qatar was awarded the World Cup in 2010. .A spokesperson for the FA said it was in ""regular dialogue"" with Amnesty International, world governing body Fifa and other member associations ""to ensure that we approach our participation in the upcoming World Cup in a socially responsible manner"". .The spokesperson added: ""From those discussions to date, we believe there is evidence of substantial progress being made by Qatar in relation to workers' rights.

It is still appalling."" .Amnesty also said ""authorities have done little to investigate the scale of unexplained deaths"" among migrant workers over the past 11 years and prevented them forming or joining trade unions. .It also said Fifa should ""use its voice to call on the Qatar government to fulfil its programme of labour reforms before the opening match of the World Cup on 21 November next year"". .Last month, Amnesty urged former England captain David Beckham to use his position as a 2022 World Cup ambassador to ""keep the world's focus on the human rights issues"". .The Qatar government said Amnesty ""fails to document a single story"" from the hundreds and thousands of workers who have benefited from its reforms. .It added: ""Qatar has also strengthened its enforcement measures to safeguard workers and prosecute employers who fail to comply with the law."" .""Labour reform is a complex task, and Qatar believes that solutions are best found through dialogue and engagement.

Qatar promised to abolish kafala, described by human rights groups as modern-day slavery, in 2016. .Amnesty said that in addition to country-wide reforms, around 30,000 workers on projects specifically for the World Cup were supposed to have benefitted from stricter labour standards, ethical recruitment, timely payment, the banning of forced labour and new accommodation. .It concluded that while these had led to ""some real improvements"", they were ""not universally respected"", and that last year World Cup organisers admitted that contractors working on one of the stadiums had breached a summer working hours ban. .An audit of 19 contractors working on World Cup sites also found that abuses such as excessive working hours remained at a majority of the companies. .Amnesty director Stephen Cockburn said: ""Time is running out if the Qatari authorities want to deliver a legacy we can all cheerâ¦ a labour system that ends the abuse and misery inflicted upon so many migrant workers. .""The authorities have been taking some important steps to protect labour rights but much more needs to be done. Holes in the reforms mean many workers are still stuck in harsh conditions."" .The Amnesty report came as Fifa hailed an important milestone in preparations for the 2022 World Cup, with the creation of a joint venture with Qatari organisers responsible for the delivery of the tournament in less than four years' time. .Qatar has also been celebrating its national team winning the Asian Cup for the first time. .Amnesty calls on Fifa to ""proactively seek to influence the Qatari authorities to fully and quickly deliver on their promised reforms so that the protection of all migrant workers may be a positive legacy of the World Cup"". .The Fifa statement added: ""Fifa continues to engage with the supreme committee for delivery and legacy and other parties towards ensuring respect for the rights of workers who are involved in Fifa World Cup-related activities. .""As part of these and other human rights-related efforts, we are in regular contact with Amnesty International."" .Last month Hassan Al-Thawadi - head of the Qatar 2022 organising committee - told the BBC that there was ""room for improvement"" on worker pay, but said there was plans for a minimum wage and that progress on reforms would continue."

But there has been no further response. .""We have no reason to believe the reported violations of workers' rights are in fact linked to Fifa and the 2022 World Cup,"" a Fifa spokesman said. .A spokesman for the Qatari government said Mercury MENA were not directly involved in the building of the stadium but in the building of the city. .""Currently there are legal proceedings under way concerning Mercury MENA,"" the spokesman said.

We celebrate this moment for Qatar and its two million migrant workers,"" said Luc Cortebeeck, chairperson of the ILO's governing body. .But Catelene Passchier, president of the Workers' Group of the ILO, told Reuters news agency: ""While we welcome and support this agreement between the ILO and Qatar, we emphasise that nice words and good intentions are not sufficient. Implementation of these intentions in law and practice is critical."" .Qatar ends 'kafala' labour system .'Forced labour' at Qatar World Cup site .Qatar workers' 'pathetic' conditions .Have 1,200 World Cup workers really died in Qatar? .Arrested for reporting on Qatar's World Cup labourers"
