Transgender Qataris can be detained for ""violating public morality"", which requires no trial or official charge. BBC News has spoken to two trans Qataris about their lives. .""I am very afraid, but I just want people to know that we do exist,"" Shahd says about her decision to speak out about life as a transgender woman. Like the other person in this article, we have changed Shahd's name to protect her. .We have been messaging her over an encrypted app for her safety, and she travels away from her home to video call us in secret from a darkened room. .Shahd shows us her hair which she was forced to cut into a masculine style, but does not reveal by whom. .She then unbuttons her shirt to show us wounds on top of her chest. .Shahd says the wounds are the consequence of being arrested for ""impersonating a woman"". Authorities told her to remove breast tissue that had formed since she started taking oestrogen, which she got without prescription from another country. .""I lost my job and my friends,"" she says. .""I was arrested and interrogated several times because of my identity. I lost everything."" .Qatar is one of more than 60 countries where it is illegal to be gay.

The prison is underground where they treat you like a criminal,"" she says. .""You will be handcuffed,"" she said, laughing dryly as she added, ""this is to protect society from us."" .We were unable to independently verify Shahd's account of being arrested, because she received no official record of being detained. .Shahd says anyone who has been to prison for similar reasons to her is sent to a doctor for so-called ""conversion therapy"". She shows us screenshots of her referrals to sessions at a therapy centre in Doha. A Qatari government official denied that the government operates or licenses any ""conversion centres"". .""They told me I might go to hell because of this, but I believe God created me the way I am,"" she said. .""I am a woman. If I could be a man, I would. My life would be much easier."" .Things got so bad for Sara, another transgender woman, that she fled Qatar and is now applying for asylum in Europe. .She tells us how she left everything she knew behind, taking just one bag of belongings and little money. .""I was at my breaking point of either committing suicide or leaving and I decided to leave."" .Sara says she too has been forced through conversion therapy several times.

Qatar has said ""everyone is welcome"", but as a gay man travelling in a country where same-sex relationships are criminalised, he tells us through his diary how the experience has been challenging. .On the way to the World Cup in Russia in 2018, the airport was absolutely packed with fans from around the world, but it just looks like an average Tuesday here tonight. .I've been an England fan for longer than I've known what the word ""gay"" means. My first memories of football are of watching the World Cup in 1990 at my grandparents' house, and being allowed to stay up late for England games. .I'm aware that my decision to go to Qatar puts me in the substantial minority of gay England fans - but if we're serious that the game is for everyone, I'm not going to let Qatar's despicable LGBT rights stop me from enjoying the game that I love. I don't feel I have to choose between being a gay man and an England fan. .I accept that I'm saying that from a position of extreme privilege. There's a layer of protection that applies to me as a western foreigner that wouldn't apply to LGBTQ Qataris. That's what I'm most conflicted about. .I'm just walking out of the stadium after the first game, Japan 2-1 Germany. A superb game. .But it's all very odd here. There's a sterile atmosphere inside the stadiums, no-one seems to quite know what to do. Security are managing things quite closely - there's a specific area to have your flags and banners examined before going in. .On the metro tonight I saw a sign saying football is ""a vehicle for respecting human rights"", to which the obvious question is - but whose human rights? .There is a tonne of security inside the stadiums, more than I've seen at any of the other tournaments. It's curious because the atmosphere here seems to be non-threatening. So what exactly are they looking out for? .I spoke to a gay fan from the Netherlands in a bar earlier. Like me, he feels somewhat conflicted about being here. .I also had one of my dating apps open today and got several messages from Saudi men. So the Qataris may pretend that queer life in the Middle East is dead, but online it's alive and well. .Just finished watching England v USA. At half-time I bumped into an England fan who was wearing a rainbow ribbon, and asked him if he had any issues getting into the stadium. Apparently he was looked over by three or four different people, but was then told, ""oh, it's OK now"". I've also seen a couple of fans in USA jerseys with rainbow numbers on the back, so I guess ""green shoots"" is the phrase. .I've been thinking about that ""football is for everyone"" slogan quite a lot since I've been here. I think the locals genuinely do believe it, they just don't consider gay fans as part of the equation. It's not necessarily homophobic, it's just such a taboo topic that we're invisible. .It's one of the reasons a lot of my fellow LGBT fans haven't been able to come out here - they've felt, for understandable reasons, excluded. .I'm walking out of the stadium at the end of the Australia v Tunisia game. .Just after half-time, a group of Tunisian fans unfurled a massive flag saying ""Free Palestine"". Nothing wrong with that - but when officials talk about keeping politics out of sport, and then a flag that size is allowed in by the flag police at the stadium. .We've watched France vs Denmark in downtown Doha with groups of Mexican, Argentinian and European fans, talking about how this compares to other World Cups. For me, there's a lot to like about how Qatar have run this from a purely football perspective, and on the field there've been some good games. .But what I keep coming back to is the sheer hypocrisy of the messaging, ""say no to discrimination"". I've met a couple of people who've said, ""you're perfectly safe here, why does it matter that you're gay?"". .I know I do have that privilege of being relatively safe compared to LGBT Qataris, but unless you've actually walked in our shoes, and have felt that feeling of unease, of feeling excluded, it's very hard to describe. .I'm about to get on my flight back to the UK, so, signing off for the last time in Qatar. .When Qatar was awarded the World Cup in 2010, there was an outcry - but it was more about the corruption allegations, not LGBT rights. Perhaps that's a measure of the progress within Europe and the UK. .Have I ever felt concerned for my safety here? No. Do I think I would've done, under other circumstances? Also no again. But do I feel that my experience here has been compromised by knowing what happens to the local LGBT population? Yes, I do. .We're told to just ""focus on the football"", but there are things in life that are more important. .As told to Josh Parry and Ashitha Nagesh. Phil shared his experience with us through voice notes on an encrypted messaging app. We are not publishing his full name. .Being an LGBT football fan from the Middle East .'A desert World Cup and a dust-storm of controversy' .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup"

The attendance of officials, teams, even fans has been questioned. But our connection with Qatar goes way beyond the current tournament, touching most of our lives. .Some may query if we are right to foster such ties with a regime whose values may appear to be at odds with British ones. .At the core of that relationship is gas. Qatar is a tiny country about the size of Yorkshire but it has one of the largest natural reserves on the planet - and the UK is a key customer. .About half our gas is imported and about half of that comes via a pipeline from Norway. But Qatar is second on that list supplying about 9% of our energy imports. In theory, that's the amount needed to power the boilers of around a million British homes. In the space of less than 20 years, Qatar has become a vital part of our energy mix. .Qatar has channelled its booming gas-based wealth into embedding itself into the UK's corporate and property landscape, and cementing a relationship with the top tiers of British establishment. .Its monarch, the Emir, was one of the few Gulf leaders to attend the Queen's funeral. The current King accepted a donation for his charitable foundation worth over £2m (part of which was allegedly handed over in Fortnum and Mason's carrier bags) from a former Qatari political leader in 2015. .Highly unusually, our nations' air forces have formed two joint squadrons - one of which is patrolling the skies above World Cup venues. .And in September, Qatar took ownership of 24 fighter jets built in Lancashire, part of a £5bn deal with BAE systems. .On the ground, the Qatari government has been recycling some of its cash by investing in the UK. It's not one of our largest investors - but its holdings are strategically chosen to maximise profile and influence. It is among the dozen biggest property owners in Britain. .Central to its property empire are landmarks including the Shard, Canary Wharf and the Shell Centre redevelopment on London's South Bank. .The Qatari government also owns luxury department store Harrods and 5* hotel Claridge's in London. .And in our day-to-day life it has significant shareholdings some of our biggest brands. Bank with Barclays, shop at Sainsbury's or use Heathrow airport, and Qatar benefits. Turn on the tap as a Severn Trent water customer, and your bill adds to its profits. .In total, Qatar's state investment arm has invested about £40bn, in areas which touch millions of British lives, and designed to ensure the influence of that tiny country punches far above its weight on British soil. .And they are funds our government has welcomed - and is keen to boost. In May, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson trumpeted an agreement for Qatar to invest up to £10bn over the next five years in the UK in sectors from cybersecurity to life sciences. .Meanwhile, our reliance on Qatari gas could rise in the future. The UK government has been nurturing the relationship with Doha, to ensure security of supply as North Sea reserves dwindle. .Britain in recent months has succeeded in cutting out imports from Russia. That was only about 4% of the UK total - but it makes the gas we source from Qatar even more crucial. .The EU is far more reliant on Russian gas, so securing alternatives is even more pressing. .Overall, the EU only got 5% of its gas from Qatar - but that could change. Olaf Scholz, chancellor of the bloc's biggest gas guzzler - Germany - has said that Qatar will play a central role in the country's strategy to diversify away from Russian gas. But it won't happen overnight. .Contract negotiations have been tricky. Qatar likes to supply gas under long-term deals, lasting 15-20 years, which may not be consistent with Western nations aims to decarbonise. .By contrast, China, with its less ambitious net-zero plans, has unveiled a 27-year agreement to buy a massive $60bn worth of Qatari gas. And Germany needs to boost its infrastructure, the terminals which receive the liquified natural gas - known as LNG - in order to take on more supplies. .The UK is ahead of the game in the latter - thanks to cooperation from Qatar. The country is a majority owner of the South Hook terminal in Wales, where LNG is offloaded into special containers. It's claimed the site can hold a fifth of the UK's daily gas needs - the Qatari government is investing millions to up that capacity by a quarter by 2025. .And by that point, Qatar is expecting to double its LNG output - with no shortage of customers. Many Asian nations are vying with Europe to tie down supplies to ensure energy security - and Qatar is seen as a relatively reliable and geopolitically tame option. The alternatives may not be attractive: for example, while part of the world's largest gas field falls in Qatari water, the rest lies in Iran's (the two countries produce gas independently). .Some of us may not be able to locate the country on a map but our relationship with Qatar seems set only to become closer in the years to come. .Why Qatar is a controversial choice for the World Cup .Qatar: Buying Britain by the pound"

Originally from Malaysia, they now live in Cardiff. .""I'm definitely not going to watch the World Cup - back in Malaysia, I usually do watch it with my family and friends because football is a big thing,"" said Jia Wei. .""If Fifa could choose another country which is more LGBT friendly, then I definitely would watch it. .""If the ambassadors are there doing basically what the Qatari officials want them to do, then the event will not really make a difference, and it will also be detrimental for the LGBTQ+ community. .""Silence can be deafening, imagine if there are many countries boycotting the tournament. .""In Paris, they're not having fan areas anymore, in Germany, they're putting up ""Boycott Qatar"" banners. .""People who are watching, look at the teams and see what they are doing to gently protest against this, and if you are going to Qatar, try to look out for the local people, and use your voice in a privileged position to help the LGBT Qatari's."" .James Brinning is a 29-year-old gay man from Cardiff. .""I am going to watch it,"" he said. .""Obviously, the moment we qualified against Ukraine, I remember being there and thinking this is the best thing that I'm ever going to see as a Welsh fan. .""Then it kind of all dawned on me on the way out of the stadium.

18 November 2022",World Cup finals: Why is Qatar 2022 controversial?," .Qatar is expecting 1.5 million football fans to visit during the World Cup finals. .But the decision to host the tournament in the Gulf state has drawn widespread criticism. .Homosexual acts are illegal in Qatar because they are considered immoral under Islamic Sharia law. .Punishments include fines, prison sentences of up to seven years - and even death by stoning. .Qatar's World Cup organisers say ""everyone is welcome"", and claim no one will be discriminated against. .However, Qatar 2022 chief executive Nasser al Khater says laws on homosexuality will not change and visitors should ""respect our culture"". .A recent Human Rights Watch reportexternal-link says Qatari security forces continue to arrest citizens who are gay, lesbian, and transgender, sometimes forcing them to undergo conversion therapy. Qatar says the report contains false allegations. .Fifa wrote to the 32 World Cup teams telling them ""now focus on the football"". It said football should not be ""dragged"" into ideological or political ""battles"". .In response, 10 European football associations - including those of England and Wales - said ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"". .England captain Harry Kane and the captains of the other nine teams involved will wear ""One Love"" armbands to show support for LGBTQ+ people. .An estimated 30,000 workers from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Philippines built facilities for the World Cup finals - including new stadiums, hotels and roads. .In February 2021, the Guardian said 6,500 workers had died in Qatar since it won its World Cup bid, using data supplied by embassies in Qatar. .However, the Qatar government said the total was misleading as it counted many foreign workers who had lived in Qatar for a long time and had not worked on World Cup projects. .Qatar's official records show that between 2014 and 2020, there were 37 deaths among labourers at World Cup stadium construction sites, only three of which were ""work-related"". .However, the International Labour Organisation says this is an underestimate. It says Qatar doesn't count deaths from heart attacks and respiratory failure as work-related - even though these are often caused from working in high temperatures. .It estimates that 50 foreign labourers died and more than 500 others were seriously injured in Qatar in 2021 alone, and another 37,600 suffered mild to moderate injuries. .Qatar announced two days before the tournament that it will not allow sales of beer at World Cup stadiums. .Now, alcohol will only be available in designated fan zones and the bars of luxury hotels. It will cost between £10 and £12 a can, or pint. .There will also be areas where drunken fans will have to go, to sober up. .Non-alcoholic beer will still be sold at the stadiums. .In 2010, Qatar clinched the rights to the World Cup after winning a ballot of Fifa's 22 executive members, beating bids from the US, South Korea, Japan and Australia. .It is the first Arab nation to host the tournament. .Qatar was accused of paying Fifa officials £3m ($3.7m) in bribes to secure their backing, but was cleared after a two-year investigation. .At the time, Fifa's then-chairman, Sepp Blatter, supported the bid, but now says it was a ""mistake"" to award the World Cup to Qatar. .There are eight stadiums, seven of which were built for the tournament. .Some 100 new hotels have also been built, as well as a new metro system, new roads, and an extension to Hamad airport. .Qatar has also built an entire new city around the Lusail stadium, in which the final match will be played. .During the months of November and December, the temperature in Qatar is usually around 25C (77F). .Had the World Cup finals been held in June and July, as they usually are, matches would have been played in temperatures exceeding 40C, and possibly reaching 50C. .Qatar initially proposed hosting the finals during the summer in air-conditioned, enclosed stadiums, but the plan was rejected."

At that time I was thinking there is something wrong with me for being gay and I didn't accept it. .I was trying to change myself - we are raised like that. .Everything around us says being gay is wrong and God will punish us for being gay. My home country is a religious country and Islam is the religion. .It took me a long time to accept myself. .Once I became comfortable and accepted myself for who I am, that's when everything changed and I felt so relieved. .The environment I was living in wasn't helpful.

It's the way they've been raised and it's hard to change that in a blink of an eye. .It will take time. .It's hard to explain that feeling of being yourself and not having to consistently lie about who you are. .Since I've come here, everyone is so supporting and, after almost three years, I have people and friends around me. .And having a supportive husband is everything I could ask for. .I consider my friends as a family and I'm so lucky to have them, especially those from the local LGBT community. .I'm not afraid to come out - but I know the consequences if I did. .I know what my family will go through and how they will blame themselves. They will think it's their fault that I am who I am. .I know what I'm going to say next contradicts what I believe in or what I'm saying. .But I always say that if you visit another country you have to respect the rules and the laws even if it's not right. .You can't just go there and break them. If you did, you have to accept what will happen. .I'm not saying we have to keep silent.

ahead of the World Cup. .Qatar has said all fans will be welcomed to the tournament ""without discrimination"". .Explaining why the gender-neutral uniform policy did not apply to Tuesday's flight, Virgin Atlantic said it was being rolled out in countries ""more accepting of non-binary identities"". .""Initially the UK, US and Israel are the territories where the uniform policy is being rolled out for our people, as those countries are more accepting of non-binary identities allowing more self-expression,"" it said. .Virgin explained that it considers safety and risk in destinations ""on a

said that, while it did not choose the plane, it was more than happy to fly on it. .It is illegal to be homosexual in Qatar, and same-sex relationships can be punishable by death. .Footballers,

including wearing the One Love Armband during the tournament"". .Earlier this year, LGBT organisations engaging with Fifa said ""progress has been slow"" in ensuring the safety of LGBT fans - and that reassurances from Qatar had ""not been adequate"". .In response, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly advised LGBT fans show ""a little bit of flex and compromise"" if they travel to the tournament. .Mr Cleverly, who will travel to Qatar, said fans travelling from England and Wales should be ""respectful of the host nation"". .Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's official spokesman later said LGBT fans should not be expected to ""compromise who they are"" if they visit Qatar for the World Cup. .Some politicians, including Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, said they would not attend the tournament due to Qatar's human rights record. .Wales's First Minister, Labour's Mark Drakeford, is expected to attend. .The England team are expected to land in Qatar at around 20:00 local time and arrive at their team base at about 21:00 GMT. .The UK government's World Cup travel advice sets out the legal status of homosexuality in Qatar and the assurances given by its authorities. .The first match of the

You know what haram [forbidden] means?"" .When asked why it was haram, he added: ""I am not a strict Muslim but why is it haram? Because it is damage in the mind."" .The interview, which is part of a documentary set to be broadcast on Tuesday, was then stopped by an accompanying official. .Rasha Younes, LGBT rights senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ""Salman's suggestion that same-sex attraction is 'damage in the mind' is harmful and unacceptable. .""The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fuelling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices."" .There is concern about how LGBTQ+ people are treated in Qatar, where same-sex relationships and the promotion of same-sex relationships are criminalised, with punishments ranging from fines to the death sentence. .The host country's World Cup organisers have stated ""everyone is welcome"" to visit the country to watch the matches and claimed no-one will be discriminated against. .However, Qatar 2022 chief executive Nasser al Khater has said the government would not change its laws on homosexuality, requesting visitors ""respect our culture"". .The Gulf State, where the World Cup will take place from 20 November to 18 December, has also been criticised for its human rights record and treatment of migrant workers. .Fifa recently wrote to competing nations asking them to ""now focus on the football"" instead of the competition's controversial build-up. .The letter, which was signed by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, was criticised by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and LGBTQ+ campaigners in England and Wales, while 10 European football associations - including those of England and Wales - said ""human rights are universal and apply everywhere"". .However, Conmebol, the South American football confederation, says it is ""time to leave controversies behind"". .LGBTQ+ campaign group All Out called on Fifa to ""end the silence and hypocrisy"" following Salman's comments. .At a protest outside Fifa's museum in Zurich, a spokesperson from All Out said: ""This comes days after All Out and others have presented testimony from LGBT+ Qataris of abduction, detention without trial, torture and conversion practices taking place in recent weeks. .""But Fifa president Infantino is still saying that everyone will be welcome at the World Cup. .""With just two weeks to go until the football starts, it is time for Fifa to stop looking away and take responsibility. .""It is time for Fifa to end the silence and hypocrisy.

1 November 2022",World Cup 2022: British officers sent to the tournament will act as 'buffers' between fans and local police," .British police officers deployed in Qatar for the World Cup will act as ""cultural interpreters"" between fans and local law enforcement, says Chief Constable Mark Roberts. .Roberts, the national lead on football policing, said British police are not there to tell fans how to behave. .""The focus is to try and prevent unfortunate misunderstandings where fans inadvertently cause offence,"" he said. .The World Cup starts on 20 November. .Those ""unfortunate misunderstandings"" could stem from fans drinking alcohol, taking shirts off, waving flags, gathering in large numbers and other stereotypes that come with football fan culture. .The UK police delegation includes a team of 15 engagement officers, who will act as a ""buffer"" between supporters and Qatari law enforcement. .""We're really keen that the British officers who go are a buffer and cultural interpreter so that we can have the first conversation with our fans before anyone else is deployed,"" added Roberts. .""Their primary focus is to liaise with the supporters and the police forces just to say 'look we're not saying you're wrong, but it's causing offence so you might want to moderate your behaviour before anyone else has to intervene'."" .Around 3,000 to 4,000 England fans are expected to travel to Qatar for the group stages, with numbers set to increase should Gareth Southgate's side reach the knockout stages. .An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Wales fans also expected to fly out to the tournament, which concludes on 18 December. .""We're not there to tell people how to behave, we don't have powers, we're not there to enforce local laws,"" Roberts said. .""What we are there to do is have a conversation with supporters. We're not going to lecture the fans on their behaviour - the advice would be to be a good guest. .""Our officers are there and if we do think there's any problems we'll look to intervene at a lower level and make sure that everyone stays safe. .A ""significant"" number of UK police officers will be on the ground acting as spotters to gather information to feed back to the Qatari commanders and act as community officers to support fans. .Turkey will send more than 3,000 riot police to Qatar as part of the security operation for the tournament. There will also be 100 special operations police sent from Turkey to Qatar, along with 50 bomb specialists and 80 sniffer dogs and riot dogs. .Last month Pakistan's cabinet approved a draft agreement allowing the government to offer troops for security at the tournament. It did not say how many personnel would be sent, and neither country has said that a final agreement has been reached. .""There may be perceptions on the part of the Qatari police or the supporting Turkish police, or any of the other agencies, about what supporters are doing,"" added Roberts. .""Just because people are noisy, bouncing up and down and chanting in a different language does not mean they're being aggressive."" .Statistics provided by the police show there were three arrests among more than 5,000 England fans who travelled to Russia for the 2018 World Cup, 15 arrests four years earlier in Brazil where more than 9,000 fans travelled, and seven arrests from more than 14,000 fans at South Africa in 2010. .Roberts said: ""You can see from the stats of previous World Cups, when people have to go to that effort and expense to get there, generally fans are going to go, watch the games and enjoy them."" .The Fifa event will be taking place in a Muslim country in the Middle East for the first time, and the consumption of alcohol is prohibited in Islam. .Fans will only be permitted to drink in the designated fan areas, one of which is a fan park which can hold up to 40,000 people and will show matches on big screens. .The other is a paid ticket event with DJ's which may not attract fans in numbers as the cheapest tickets are said to start from £75. .Ashley Brown from the Football Supporters Association (FSA) said many fans have been ""priced out"" of the World Cup with concerns also around the lack of accommodation available to supporters. .""There's a combination of reasons why people are being deterred,"" Brown said. .""For a lot of people Qatar doesn't sound like an exciting place to go, it's not a typical holiday destination, lack of alcohol availability, cost of getting there, cost when you're there, it's put a lot of people off."" .The World Cup is expected to attract more than one million visitors, but by March Qatar only had 30,000 hotel rooms, 80% of which had already been booked by Fifa for football teams, officials, and sponsors. .Organisers are offering shared rooms in empty apartments, villas, fan villages and traditional-style tents in the desert with two cruise ships being converted into floating hotels that will be moored at Doha's port. .Some fans are even opting to travel in from nearby Dubai. .Another point of contention for travelling fans has been the fact that homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and many gay fans have opted to boycott the tournament. .""It's very sad,"" said Brown. ""Three Lions Pride who represent that community as travelling England fans - I don't think any are going. .""They don't feel safe, they don't feel comfortable and they don't feel reassured and that is incredibly disappointing that Fifa can put a tournament in a country that won't welcome those people."" .Fans have also been encouraged by the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Alicia Kearns, to leave their personal phones at home and take burner phones instead to Qatar. This comes amid fears that apps you have to download in Qatar are being used to hack into people's phones. .""We heard the same for Russia and I'm not aware of any problems that were had in Russia,"" said Brown. .""I've been to Qatar twice, I've used my own phone, I've not had any issues."""
